First things first, this really is only a tease because none of these new Wahoo electronics are ready to ship until next month, and we haven’t yet had them in our own hands to see how they work. But Sea Otter starts in a couple days, and Wahoo was just too excited to wait to share what they’ve been working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wahoo debuts all-new Trackr Radar safety rear light</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_taillight-view.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_taillight-view.webp\" alt=\"All-new Wahoo Trackr Radar safety rear light with vehicle approach warning system, brake light\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_taillight-view.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_taillight-view-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_taillight-view-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_taillight-view-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_taillight-view-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All images/Wahoo)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, I’ll admit that I love the simplicity of the Roam &amp; Bolt, so I’ll get to those updates in a second. But what I really want to talk about – and maybe speculate about – is the all-new Trackr Radar taillight for additional on-road rider safety. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo hopes to boost safety for all riders – whether you use their ELEMNT GPS cycling computer or not – with the introduction of the all-new Trackr Radar. They describe it as a “<em>cutting-edge rear light that provides ultimate visibility and vehicle detection, seamlessly integrating with all bike computers</em>“. Add it to a couple of generations of Garmin Varia, Bryton Gardia, Magene Radar, and Trek CarBack <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=radar\" target=\"_blank\">radar taillights</a>, and a new Wahoo Trackr Radar just means more options for on-road riders looking to feel safer mixing it up with cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what details do we know about Trackr Radar?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wahoo radar functions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering.webp\" alt=\"All-new Wahoo Trackr Radar safety rear light with vehicle approach warning system, rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-rendering-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Direct Vehicle Warning</em></strong>. Of course, the Trackr Radar will detect cars approaching from behind, and it’s first response is to increase the frequency/intensity of its flashing pattern to increase the cyclist’s visibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Brake Light.</em></strong> It also works as a conventional brake light, thanks to a built-in accelerometer, increasing taillight brightness when you quickly slow down.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>On-GPS Vehicle Warning?</em></strong> This core cycling radar function isn’t entirely clear about how it will be displayed. But Wahoo says the Trackr Radar seamlessly connects to their Element family of GPS cycling computers “for the ultimate user experience”. But it also connects to any other “compatible Bluetooth or ANT+ bike computers”, so you should get vehicle approaching warnings on other GPS devices, too.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Battery Extender Mode.</em></strong> We don’t have clear stats on runtimes. But a special mode will allow the radar to reduce taillight brightness when no cars are approaching to extend battery life for up to 20 hours of riding with continuous Direct and On-GPS vehicle approaching warnings</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Easy Attach. </em></strong>The new Trackr Radar fits to your seatpost with a standard rubber band strap mount. Wahoo describes the connection as a “dual-mounting system” which looks like you can detach the device while keeping the rubber band mount on your seatpost. And maybe there will be additional mounting bracket options like a fixed mount to your saddle rails? </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view.webp\" alt=\"All-new Wahoo Trackr Radar safety rear light with vehicle approach warning system, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/All-new-Wahoo-Trackr-Radar-safety-rear-light-with-vehicle-approach-warning-system_angled-side-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One final bit of key information we do know, the new Wahoo Trackr Radar rear light will sell for $200 / 200€.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“At Wahoo Fitness, we’re driven by innovation that empowers athletes to push their limits.

The new Elemnt Roam v3 now adds a touchscreen to make it easier to manage your route on-the-fly. And it adds almost 50% more battery life to track your longest rides!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest change is the move to a new anti-glare touchscreen for its slightly larger 2.8″ high-contrast display (up from 2.7″ in v2), bringing “glove-friendly multi-touch” functionality that will let you pinch to zoom and swipe through maps and data displays. Then, add to that eight more hours of battery life, now up to 25 hours of ride tracking and navigating run time so you can ride more between recharges.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount.webp\" alt=\"Wahoo Elemnt Roam v3 cycling GPS computer updates, angled side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wahoo-Elemnt-Roam-v3-cycling-GPS-computer-updates_side-view-on-mount-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Roam also promises better than ever navigation &amp; route management, with more detailed mapping, elevation data, clearer differentiation of road surface type, and even voice turn-by-turn directions.
