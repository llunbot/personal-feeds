That contrast was large enough, in fact, that a prominent Bethesda executive was bewildered by it in a private email to fellow Bethesda employees last year.</p>\n<p>The February 2022 email, which was revealed as part of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/\">the Federal Trade Commission trial seeking to block the Activision deal</a> (as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1673470891433271297\">noted by Axios' Steven Totilo</a>), shows Bethesda Senior VP of Global Marketing and Communication Pete Hines perplexed by <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/\">Microsoft's public comments at the time</a> regarding keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation consoles going forward. \"I'm confused,\" Hines writes. \"Is [this Call of Duty policy] not the opposite of what we were just asked (told) to do with our own titles? What's the difference?\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand that there is likely nuance here, but at its core it's being read as the opposite of what happened with us,\" Hines said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1673483158665265152/photo/1\">a separate email</a> to Microsoft Xbox Chief Phil Spencer the same day.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950170#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950170&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc2e5b9afbc546d28bf5d6ffa7cfe6df18a9c78ccbb82e72e29b9148b421d30f","category":"Tech"}
