These include different color gradients and the ability to use photos from your photo library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nElsewhere, ‌FaceTime‌ has also gained the ability to preview what you're going to share in a video call when using screen sharing. Video calling apps will now give you a small preview of what will be shared before you okay the sharing process, which is useful to double check that you're not sharing information you don't want everyone to see. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/will-my-mac-run-macos-sequoia/\">Will My Mac Run macOS Sequoia?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1 is currently in its second developer beta phase and is expected to arrive for all users with supporting Macs later this year, following the release of ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.
