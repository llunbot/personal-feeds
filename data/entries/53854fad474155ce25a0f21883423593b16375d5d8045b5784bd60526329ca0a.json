Share some of them with you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often overlooked, the bicycle head badge can be something the brand has spent a good amount of time thinking about and executing… making sure that it’s just right. In some cases, contracting an outside source to get it just right for you – like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/made-show-wildes-lugged-gravel-bike-with-modern-geometry/\" target=\"_blank\">Wilde Bikes sterling silver</a> head badge made by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jengreenheadbadges/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Jen Green</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you’ll find a lil’ gallery of some (<em>but not quite all</em>) of my favorite head badges of the show, plus a little somethin’ special at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let’s pay some attention to the art of ornate bicycle head badges. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Monē Bikes </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mone-Bikes-e1693519008354.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"486\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mone-Bikes-e1693519008354.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Mone Bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mone-Bikes-e1693519008354.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mone-Bikes-e1693519008354-297x113.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mone-Bikes-e1693519008354-800x305.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mone-Bikes-e1693519008354-120x46.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mone-Bikes-e1693519008354-768x293.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

Making Monē mobile, Cjell prides himself on “keeping overhead low and quality high.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This head badge is simple with understated details. I also get a feel of retro 80s in the design. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Neuhaus Metalworks</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Neuhouse-Metalworks-e1693519131931.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"736\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Neuhouse-Metalworks-e1693519131931.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Neuhouse Metalworks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Neuhouse-Metalworks-e1693519131931.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Neuhouse-Metalworks-e1693519131931-297x171.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Neuhouse-Metalworks-e1693519131931-800x461.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Neuhouse-Metalworks-e1693519131931-120x69.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Neuhouse-Metalworks-e1693519131931-768x443.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Located in the birthplace of mountain bikes, Marin County, California, <a href=\"https://www.neuhausmetalworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neuhaus Metal Works</a> believes in Fit + Function = Form.

He came to the US to study sculpting, graduating in 2000.

These head badges are a couple more impressive examples of Nao’s attention to detail. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mosaic Cycles</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mosiac-e1693519255263.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mosiac-e1693519255263.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Mosiac\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mosiac-e1693519255263.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mosiac-e1693519255263-297x138.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mosiac-e1693519255263-800x371.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mosiac-e1693519255263-120x56.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Mosiac-e1693519255263-768x356.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mosaiccycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mosaic Cycles</a> of Boulder, Colorado, specializing in high-quality, custom bicycles (like this one), and stock-sized bicycles (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mosaic-gt-2-gravel-series-stock-sizing-opens-handcrafted-ti-gravel-bikes-to-more-cyclists/\" target=\"_blank\">like this one</a>). They are “dedicated to providing the best possible riding experience”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This head badge is machined to show the color of the bike through the details in the badge. The badge lets you know it’s a Mosaic without seeing the rest of the bike. As iconic as a Schwinn head badge? Maybe.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sycip Designs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Sycip-Cycles-e1693519412128.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Sycip-Cycles-e1693519412128.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Sycip Cycles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Sycip-Cycles-e1693519412128.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Sycip-Cycles-e1693519412128-297x134.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Sycip-Cycles-e1693519412128-800x361.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Sycip-Cycles-e1693519412128-120x54.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Sycip-Cycles-e1693519412128-768x347.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy Sycip of <a href=\"https://www.sycip.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sycip Designs</a> is located in Santa Rosa, California and has been building beautiful custom frames since 1992. He can build custom steel, titanium, or aluminum frames for your road, all-road, cx, commuters, or mountain biking needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in my opinion, this is an example of an iconic head badge. And it’s one that I have personally always liked and coveted. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ira Ryan Cycles</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Ira-Ryan-Cycles-e1693519439777.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Ira-Ryan-Cycles-e1693519439777.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Ira Ryan Cycles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Ira-Ryan-Cycles-e1693519439777.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Ira-Ryan-Cycles-e1693519439777-297x144.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Ira-Ryan-Cycles-e1693519439777-800x389.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Ira-Ryan-Cycles-e1693519439777-120x58.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Ira-Ryan-Cycles-e1693519439777-768x373.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://iraryanbicycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ira Ryan Cycles</a> <em>is</em> Ira Ryan and he’s been hand building each frame, fork stem, and bicycle by hand in his Portland workshop since 2005. “<em>With one foot planted in a rich history of bicycle racing and what technology works well, I blend those styles with modern components using brass, silver, and stee</em>l”, as he describes it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ira Ryan head badge represents the brand perfectly.

Nice. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fat Chance Bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Fat-Chance-Cycles-e1693519887889.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Fat-Chance-Cycles-e1693519887889.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Fat Chance Cycles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Fat-Chance-Cycles-e1693519887889.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Fat-Chance-Cycles-e1693519887889-297x169.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Fat-Chance-Cycles-e1693519887889-800x455.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Fat-Chance-Cycles-e1693519887889-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Fat-Chance-Cycles-e1693519887889-768x437.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Chance of <a href=\"https://fatchance.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Fat Chance Bikes</a> is considered a staple in the birth of mountain biking on the East Coast. And the Yo Eddie is an iconic name in the story that is the beginning of mountain biking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the one-of-a-kind head badge from Fat Chance’s latest iteration of the Titanium Yo Eddie Team Fat Chance frameset. It’s wicked good.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Soulcraft Cycles (Honorable Mention)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-head-badge-e1693519924798.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-head-badge-e1693519924798.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Soulcraft Plowboy head badge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-head-badge-e1693519924798.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-head-badge-e1693519924798-297x104.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-head-badge-e1693519924798-800x281.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-head-badge-e1693519924798-120x42.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-head-badge-e1693519924798-768x270.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, I’ve included a photo of a less ornate head badge, more of a logo, and a worn one at that,  from a custom builder that is no longer making frames, but I feel needs an honorary mention. The builder is Sean Walling and the company is <a href=\"http://soulcraftbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Soulcraft Cycles</a> out of Petaluma, California. Sean stopped Soulcraft and ceased making frames about 8 years ago or so, I believe. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-hero-e1693520006270.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"745\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-hero-e1693520006270.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Soulcraft Plowboy hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-hero-e1693520006270.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-hero-e1693520006270-297x173.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-hero-e1693520006270-800x467.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-hero-e1693520006270-120x70.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-hero-e1693520006270-768x448.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-down-tube-logo-e1693519990256.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"758\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-down-tube-logo-e1693519990256.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Soulcraft Plowboy down tube logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-down-tube-logo-e1693519990256.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-down-tube-logo-e1693519990256-297x176.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-down-tube-logo-e1693519990256-800x475.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-down-tube-logo-e1693519990256-120x71.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-down-tube-logo-e1693519990256-768x456.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was not only a fan of the brand, but I was also a customer… as I had purchased two frames from him, the single-speed specific Soulcraft Plowboy back in ’99 and the Soulcraft Royal Road frame in 2006. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-Sean-wheelie-e1693520071417.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"595\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-Sean-wheelie-e1693520071417.jpeg\" alt=\"Head badge Round Up - Soulcraft Plowboy Sean wheelie\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-Sean-wheelie-e1693520071417.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-Sean-wheelie-e1693520071417-297x138.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-Sean-wheelie-e1693520071417-800x373.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-Sean-wheelie-e1693520071417-120x56.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Head-badge-Round-Up-Soulcraft-Plowboy-Sean-wheelie-e1693520071417-768x358.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Sean Walling poppin’ wheelies at the MADE Show</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when I saw him poppin’ wheelies at the MADE Show, on a (<em>what he personally dated a 2001</em>) Plowboy that he had just purchased from someone at the show, I was overcome with nostalgia.
