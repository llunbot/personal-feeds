Leveraging the zone-specific support and squish that you can get from 3D-printed padding, BikeYoke calls their new Sagma 3D “<em>possibly the most comfortable saddle you’ve ever ridden</em>“. And while a lot of 3D-printed saddles hover around the $300-400/300-400€ range, BikeYoke’s most affordable Sagma 3D sells for just 160€.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BikeYoke Sagma 3D-printed saddle comfort for much less</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail.webp\" alt=\"BikeYoke Sagma 3D affordable 3d-printed saddle comfort, angled top detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_angled-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Images/BikeYoke)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Sagma 3D is the successor to BikeYoke’s already interesting Sagma saddle. Debuted <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikeyoke-drops-all-new-sagma-floating-mtb-saddle-affordable-divine-dropper/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2019</a>, it offered comfort both with slow-rebound memory IDbeads foam padding and a unique tunable vibration-damping rail structure. Then <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikeyoke-sagma-saddle-with-carbon-or-lite-regular-rails-plus-barkeeper-raw-stem/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2022</a>, lighter versions with conventional rails. I’ve ridden both quite a bit on my mountain bikes, and appreciate both BikeYoke’s chosen level of padding and the floating rail design. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_hidden-lattice-structure.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_hidden-lattice-structure.webp\" alt=\"BikeYoke Sagma 3D affordable 3d-printed saddle comfort, internal stucture\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_hidden-lattice-structure.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_hidden-lattice-structure-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_hidden-lattice-structure-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_hidden-lattice-structure-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_hidden-lattice-structure-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Sagma 3D 3D-printed support structure</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, BikeYoke says they can make the Sagma even better in 3D… well with 3D-printed padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why a 3D-printed saddle in the first place?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>3D-printed saddles are hot right now.

The additive lattice construction allows designers to easily vary padding density (independent of thickness) and thus vary level of support across individual areas of the saddle with a single material. A saddle can be more rigid and supportive under your sit bones, while being more forgiving under your soft tissue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But individualized padding unique to your own pressure zones turned out to be quite difficult to do on a commercial scale. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/posedla-joyseat-3d-printed-custom-saddle/\">Posedla</a> has been doing it for 3 years with a creative low-tech pressure map setup. And since last summer, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fizik-one-to-one-custom-3d-printed-saddles-use-quick-gebiomized-pressure-fit-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Fizik</a> has leveraged smart pressure sensors in bike shops around the world to custom-fit cyclists on their own bespoke saddles. But both of those cost almost $500-600 / 450-500€.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones.webp\" alt=\"BikeYoke Sagma 3D affordable 3d-printed saddle comfort, support zones\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BikeYoke-Sagma-3D-affordable-3d-printed-saddle-comfort_padding-zones-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Sagma 3D support zones</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit more accessible price-wise, saddle designers simply need to map generalized saddle pressure data to establish the separate zones for a universal fit.
