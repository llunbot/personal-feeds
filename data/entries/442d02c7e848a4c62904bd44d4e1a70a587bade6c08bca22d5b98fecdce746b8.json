You also be able to get it in  Flight Attendant-equipped SID, SID SL, Pike, Lyrik, and ZEB Ultimate Flight Attendant forks with automated controls.  Out back, all new MY26 SIDLuxe, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, Vivid, and Vivid Coil Ultimate rear shocks will come with a special Electric Red decal package for a matchy-matchy setup.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MY26 RockShox Flight Attendant Adds Nino’s Launch Control</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After the Short Track race in Flight Attendant’s World Cup racing debut on a Friday afternoon in June of 2023, Nino Schurter told the RockShox race support engineers that he wanted something special. An automated Launch Control mode that would keep his Flight Attendant set to fully locked out for the explosive race start, but that would then automatically reset to proper Auto mode controls so he could just focus on racing, not pressing buttons. By Saturday night, RockShox Software Engineer, Grant Rudd had coded the new feature and tested it out in the middle of the night on the empty streets of Lenzerheide. Then, on Sunday afternoon with new firmware uploading his custom Launch control mode to his bike, Schurter sprinted off and won his 34th Cross-Country World Cup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can be as fast as Nino!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>OK, well, probably not. But at least you can have Launch Control, too.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What more can Flight Attendant do now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-updated-with-Nino-Schurter-World-Cup-winning-Launch-Control.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-updated-with-Nino-Schurter-World-Cup-winning-Launch-Control.webp\" alt=\"RockShox Flight Attendant upgrade adds Nino's Launch Control\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-updated-with-Nino-Schurter-World-Cup-winning-Launch-Control.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-updated-with-Nino-Schurter-World-Cup-winning-Launch-Control-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-updated-with-Nino-Schurter-World-Cup-winning-Launch-Control-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-updated-with-Nino-Schurter-World-Cup-winning-Launch-Control-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-updated-with-Nino-Schurter-World-Cup-winning-Launch-Control-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Launch Control gives each rider control over how their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rockshox-flight-attendant-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Flight Attendan</a>t locks out for race starts. You pick how long you want it locked, then Flight Attendant will stiffen up your bike for maximum pedaling efficiency, and automatically return to Auto after your preset time or when it detects a bump, whichever occurs first. It’s easy to activate holding down either your AXS remote or the + button on the fork. And all five LEDs pulse read to tell you Launch Control is engaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a new Fork-only update that enables the use of Flight Attendant on hardtails so you get the same no-bob pedaling efficiency, no connected rear shock required. (But you do need a pedaling sensor, SRAM/Quarq power meter, or an ANT+ ebike motor to be connected.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-controls-in-the-AXS-app.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-controls-in-the-AXS-app.webp\" alt=\"RockShox Flight Attendant adds more in-app controls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-controls-in-the-AXS-app.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-controls-in-the-AXS-app-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-controls-in-the-AXS-app-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-controls-in-the-AXS-app-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Flight-Attendant-controls-in-the-AXS-app-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And now RockShox also gives more Auto mode customization via the AXS app. You now get the option to completely bypass Pedal mode if you’d rather cycle directly from Open to Lock. Or you can disable the full lock-out position on either your fork or shock if you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Charger Race Day 2 Flight Attendant Upgrade Kit</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit.webp\" alt=\"RockShox adds Charger Race Day 2 Flight Attendant Upgrade Kit to upgrade existing SID SL forks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-RockShox-Charger-Race-Day-2-Flight-Attendant-Upgrade-Kit-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And since there’s a new Fork-only option, MY26 RockShox now offers a simple Charger Race Day 2 Flight Attendant Upgrade Kit. For $600 / 650€, hardtail owners who already have a 2021-2024 SID or SID SL fork can easily upgrade to Flight Attendant and get automatic fork controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not a cheap upgrade, but a pretty cool option for the hardtail XC racer or someone with a softail or incompatible integrated rear shock like the latest Specialized <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-epic-world-cup-rockshox-sid-wcid/\" target=\"_blank\">Epic World Cup</a>. Or even some ultra-distance gravel adventure racers with a SID fork?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/rockshox\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM.com/RockShox</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/my26-rockshox-goes-deluxe-adds-electric-red-gives-flight-attendant-extra-launch-control/\">MY26 RockShox Goes Deluxe, Adds Electric Red &amp; Gives Flight Attendant Extra (Launch) Control</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"442d02c7e848a4c62904bd44d4e1a70a587bade6c08bca22d5b98fecdce746b8","category":"Cycling"}
