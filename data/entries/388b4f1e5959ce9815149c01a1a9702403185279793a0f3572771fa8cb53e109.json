SRAM 12-speed drivetrains are specced, with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-gx-eagle-12-speed-drivetrain-review/\" target=\"_blank\">GX Eagle</a> on the Elite model, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\" target=\"_blank\">NX Eagle</a> on the Comp</p>\n<p>The majority of the finishing kit on both models is taken care of by Specialized-branded and in-house brand Roval parts, except the dropper posts where a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/oneup-v2-dropper-post-with-oneup-dropper-post-remote-v2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">OneUp V2 Dropper Post</a> is specced on the Elite and an X-Fusion Manic on the Comp.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Big S is making some incredible bikes at the moment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<section><div>\n        <h4>Which 2022 Stumpjumper Evo Alloy would I buy?</h4>\n<p>I’ll be honest, when this press release came through I got a bit excited.</p>\n<p>As someone who doesn’t like parting with cash in all walks of life (including but not limited to putting the heating on in winter, buying clothes, going ‘out’, etc), trying to find a high-performing, well-specced and relatively affordable bike can be a headache.</p>\n<p>The 2022 Stumpjumper Evo Elite Alloy isn’t a steal by any stretch of the imagination, but at £4,500 / $5,600 / €6,000 it’s significantly more affordable than quite a few bikes on the market – and is impressively specced.</p>\n<p>The 36 fork has Fox’s GRIP2 damper, it’s got SRAM Code RS brakes and SRAM’s 12-speed GX Eagle drivetrain. Top that off with OneUp’s V2 Dropper and Roval’s Traverse Alloy wheels and it looks like a bike I would have specced myself.</p>\n<p>Factor in the adjustable – and arguably, very progressive – geometry and impressive suspension, and if I was in the market for a new bike, I would almost be falling over myself to get my hands on a Stumpjumper Evo Elite Alloy.</p>\n<p>Of course, the only caveat to that is that it needs to ride as well as the S-Works Stumpjumper Evo I tested previously, but if it does, it could be one of the <a

to the 2022 Stumpjumper Evo Alloy?</h3>\n<p>Confined within the limits of the £4,500 / $5,600 / €6,000 price point, the super-progressive Evo geometry does limit the Stumpy’s competitors.</p>\n<p>One of the closest competitors is <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/marin-alpine-trail-2021/\">Marin’s Alpine Trail Carbon</a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/marin-alpine-trail-2021/\" target=\"_blank\"> 2</a>, which retails for £3,995 and has 150mm of travel and a 63.5-degree head tube angle.</p>\n<p>We reviewed the more affordable <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2021-marin-alpine-trail-carbon-1-review/\">Alpine Trail 1</a> and were impressed by its geometry and suspension.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With a great ride and a price tag lower than that of some brands’ carbon frames, the Marin is a real bargain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/nukeproof-mega-290-elite-carbon-review/\" target=\"_blank\">The Nukeproof Mega 290 Elite Carbon</a> is also a close competitor, costing £4,349.99.</p>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/nukeproof-mega-290-carbon-rs-review/\">Mega 290 Carbon RS</a> has more travel (160mm) and a steeper head angle (64 degrees), and it doesn’t get Fox Factory suspension, when we tested it we were impressed by its appetite for big terrain, but it lacks the adjustability of the Stumpjumper Evo.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Nukeproof Mega 290 Carbon RS full-suspension bike is bred to tackle the roughest and rowdiest trails.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Arguably, the Stumpy is also in a category of its own, bridging the gap between trail bikes and enduro bikes, which means direct price, geometry and travel competitors are thin on the ground.</p>\n<h3>2022 Specialized Stumpjumper Evo Elite Alloy</h3>\n<div>\n    <img
