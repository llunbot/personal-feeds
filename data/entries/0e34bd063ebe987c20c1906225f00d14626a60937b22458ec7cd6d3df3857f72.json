{"title":"Apple releases iOS 17.2.1 with mystery bug fixes","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2176376/ios-17-2-1-mystery-bug-fixes.html","date":1703019302000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple just dropped an unexpected iOS update with almost no word about what’s in it. iOS 17.2.1 has the following release notes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update provides important bug fixes and is recommended for all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website:<br />https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re hoping that the security support page has more information, you’ll be disappointed. While iOS 17.2.1 is listed there (along with Safari 17.2.1 and iOS 16.7.4), there’s no actual security content described. “This update has no published CVE entries” is all you’ll find. There’s a single screen-sharing fix in macOS 14.2.1, also released today, but not shared by any of the other OS updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the fix is, it seemingly impacts older iPhones as well. For iPhones that run iOS 16 but can’t run iOS 17 (iPhone 8 and iPhone X), Apple released iOS 16.7.4 today as well. Those release notes state that the update “fixes an issue where built-in Apple apps that have been deleted may not install.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update to iOS 17.2.1, go the the Settings app, then <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>, and follow the prompts.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0e34bd063ebe987c20c1906225f00d14626a60937b22458ec7cd6d3df3857f72","category":"Apple"}
