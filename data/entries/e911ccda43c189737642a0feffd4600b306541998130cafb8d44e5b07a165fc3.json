{"title":"2021 Emmy Nominations","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/arts/television/emmys-nominees-list-2021.html","date":1626221529000,"content":"\n<p>The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Netflix’s <em>The Crown</em> and the Disney+ Star Wars drama <em>The\nMandalorian</em> led the way with 24 nominations each. HBO led all the\nnetworks with 130 nominations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple TV+ did well, too, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/apple-tv-plus-emmy-nominations-2/\">with 34 total nominations</a>, led, no surprise, by the delightful <em>Ted Lasso</em>. Maybe Apple TV+ isn’t <em>the</em> new HBO but just <em>a</em> new HBO. Just a lot of good stuff from these premium platforms last year. We loved HBO’s <em>Mare of Easttown</em>, which was justly rewarded with numerous nominations. I still think the HBO Max branding is off — just call the damn thing “HBO” — but HBO is holding its own in its <a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/blogs/netflix-has-become-hbo/\">decade-old race to become Netflix before Netflix can become HBO</a>. They’re both in good shape.</p>\n\n<p>What’s shocking now isn’t that premium streaming services do well with Emmy nominations, but that traditional network scripted shows — comedy and drama — are nearly shut out. All the best shows now are on the new streaming platforms.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/13/2021-emmy-nominations\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e911ccda43c189737642a0feffd4600b306541998130cafb8d44e5b07a165fc3","category":"Tech"}
