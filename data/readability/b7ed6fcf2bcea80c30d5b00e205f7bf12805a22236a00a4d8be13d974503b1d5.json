The new Karma 2 keeps the somewhat aggressive tread pattern and openly spaced design that helps it perform well in loose, wet conditions.</p><p>What’s new is a lighter version of their SCT sidewall protection that puts a cut protection layer on the sidewalls. But there’s no extra puncture protection under the tread cap to help keep it light.</p><p>The Karma 2 will come in 2.2″ and 2.4″ sizes, with 29er claimed weights ranging from 595g up to 776g. Weights for 27.5″ models are 581g to 653g. Two versions are offered, the TR (Tubeless Race) that skips the sidewall cut layer to save more weight, and the SCT version, which will come in both black and brown sidewalls.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg\" alt=\"new kenda rush mountain bike tire tread pattern detail\" width=\"1286\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg 1286w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-297x208.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-800x560.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-120x84.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-768x537.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1286px) 100vw, 1286px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg 1286w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-297x208.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-800x560.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-120x84.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021824/kenda-rush-pro-xc-mountain-bike-tires-1-768x537.jpg 768w\"></a></p><p>The new Kenda Rush is, in their words, an evolution of the Sabre (which will remain in the line), but faster rolling. It uses the same new SCT casing, and also comes in TR versions, but only in a 29×2.2 size.</p><p>A new dual compound rubber was developed for this tire to give it bite while also rolling fast. The small, sharp-edged knobs should help it dig into the ground a bit, but it’s definitely a dry conditions race tire. Claimed weights are just 525g for the TR model, and 607g for SCT.</p><p>Both the Karma 2 and Rush should be available in Spring 2022, along with most of the other new mountain bike tire sizes shown below.</p><h2>New sizes for Regolith, Hellkat &amp; Booster</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2.jpg\" alt=\"kenda hellkat and regolith mountain bike tire closeups\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03021814/kenda-hellkat-pro-regolith-kids-mountain-bike-tires-2022-sizes-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\"></a></p><p>Kenda’s most aggressive tires, the Regolith and Hellkat, get a lot of new sizes for sizes of riders.
