This feature can identify background music from the lock screen, but unlike some <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ios-18s-new-home-screen-features-are-a-long-awaited-win-for-flexibility/\">similar song identifiers</a>, it works even without an Internet connection. Sadly, it has been broken for months. There is some hope, though. Google has indicated that a fix is ready for deployment, and Pixel users can expect to see it in a future OS update.</p>\n<p>First <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/pixel-2-and-2-xl-review-the-best-android-phone-you-can-buy/\">introduced in 2017</a>, Now Playing uses a cache of thousands of audio fingerprints to identify songs you might encounter in your daily grind. Since it works offline, it's highly efficient and preserves your privacy. Now Playing isn't a life-changing addition to the mobile experience, but it's damn cool.</p>\n<p>That makes it all the stranger that Google appears to have broken Now Playing with the release of Android 15 (or possibly a Play Services update around the same time) and has left it that way for months. Before that update, Now Playing would regularly list songs on the lock screen and offer enhanced search for songs it couldn't ID offline. It was obvious to Pixel fans when Now Playing stopped listening last year, and despite a large volume of online complaints, Google has seemingly dragged its feet.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-will-finally-fix-awesome-but-broken-song-detection-feature-for-pixels/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-will-finally-fix-awesome-but-broken-song-detection-feature-for-pixels/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6a5b5144c0e1106faafd637d3a4290c091ee2d3af6aa1fcbbcbd812aa3fa0ca","category":"Tech"}
