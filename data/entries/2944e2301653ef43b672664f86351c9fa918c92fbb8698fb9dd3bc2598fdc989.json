There are multiple complaints <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/1htwhux/apple_tv_keeps_getting_out_of_sync_with_audio/\">on Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255553402?sortBy=rank\">the Apple Support forums</a> about Dolby Atmos audio syncing issues with sound bars and speakers, including those connected via ‌AirPlay‌ and Bluetooth, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn affected devices, users find that dialog and other audio can be slightly out of sync with the content that's playing, so lips do not move correctly when people speak in TV shows and movies, and sound effects like explosions are delayed. Switching to 5.1 surround sound eliminates the problem, but people with expensive audio setups have been understandably disappointed not to be able to use Dolby Atmos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that the new Dolby Atmos synchronization feature for ‌AirPlay‌ and Bluetooth speakers can be found by going to Settings &gt; Video and Audio &gt; Wireless Audio Sync.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/tvos-18-5-dolby-atmos-synchronization/\">tvOS 18.5 Adds Synchronized Dolby Atmos Playback for AirPlay and Bluetooth Speakers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-18-5-adds-synchronized-dolby-atmos-playback-for-airplay-and-bluetooth-speakers.2457010/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2944e2301653ef43b672664f86351c9fa918c92fbb8698fb9dd3bc2598fdc989","category":"Apple"}
