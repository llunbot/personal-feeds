Those looking for a pair of AirPods can get the latest noise-canceling AirPods Pro for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3n8sBrn\" target=\"_blank\">$200</a> ($250) or forego noise cancellation and add about 90 minutes of battery life with the third-generation AirPods for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YVXL2g\" target=\"_blank\">$150</a> ($170), both of which are discounted to prices we haven't seen since Black Friday. You can also nab a four-pack of Apple AirTags for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/40olU2m\" target=\"_blank\">$90</a>, which is $10 off their usual price.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_0919.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Apple's 2023 Mac mini.

Equipped with Apple's M2 processor and 8GB of RAM, we found the Mac Mini to be cool, quiet, energy-efficient and packing enough power for anything short of serious gaming and heavy-duty rich media content creation. Gamers who want a Mac Mini (for the few games that run on them) and folks working in professional edit bays or the like should look to the M2 Pro-equipped Minis. Otherwise, this model is plenty capable of editing photos and videos from your phone, creating documents, and general browsing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925255#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925255&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"756e77e6193e25ca0352e63816393c7673f0424c8aad9eb47858803832c0dd69","category":"Tech"}
