Any deposits above $250,000, up to the new $1 million limit, would not be covered by the FDIC in the event of bank failure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome other high-yield savings accounts in the U.S. offer balance limits above $250,000. For example, Goldman Sachs' other high-yield savings account Marcus allows a maximum balance of $1 million per account, up to a total of $3 million.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple launched its savings account <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/\">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. Apple's savings account <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-savings-account-apy-increase/\">currently offers a 4.5% APY</a> following an increase in late January.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/\">end its partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear how this might impact the Apple Card and the savings account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Jose Perez Jr.!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/\">Apple Card Savings Account's Balance Limit Increased to $1 Million</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-accounts-balance-limit-increased-to-1-million.2420824/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"61e4dedaddece05d7564dfa2bebedc893ac80ea1cf49df8fc973df920873a48f","category":"Apple"}
