I was initially worried about the bottle getting in the way, but after mounting it, I saw that in my particular application, it didn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-mounted-to-the-right.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-mounted-to-the-right.jpeg\" alt=\"King Cage Stainless Side Loader Review mounted to the right\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-mounted-to-the-right.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-mounted-to-the-right-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-mounted-to-the-right-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-mounted-to-the-right-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I would imagine that my application, on the inside of the down tube, would be 90% of the applications for this cage. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Side Loader Out on The Trail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know in the end, it’s just a water bottle cage, but using the Side Loader was a little bit of a game-changer, for me. Let me explain. Like most of us, I’ve always at the minimum, had a bottle cage on the inside of my down tube. In a tight frame, like the Haro Saguaro 1, or my RSD Middle Child, it’s always been fairly easy to get to, but tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-on-the-ride.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-on-the-ride.jpeg\" alt=\"King Cage Stainless Side Loader Review on the ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-on-the-ride.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-on-the-ride-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-on-the-ride-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Cage-Stainless-Side-Loader-Review-on-the-ride-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Tough to photograph while riding. It looks to be in the way, but it’s not even close. But perfect for a quick and easy grab of the bottle. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Haro Saguaro 1, I initially installed and tried the King Cage <a href=\"https://kingcage.com/collections/all-products/products/stainless-steel-bottle-lowering-cage\">Stainless Steel Bottle Lowering</a> cage. I ran that cage on the bike for a few rides. It worked fine, but still felt a bit tight in the front triangle. After the first ride with the side King Cage Stainless Side Loader mounted, as you might expect, grabbing my water bottle was easy. In fact, reaching for my water bottle and putting it back while riding has never been easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Side Loader Retail, Go Get One</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, it’s not a huge problem. But if you can’t efficiently use a traditional water bottle in your bicycle’s front triangle, then the King Cage Stainless Steel Side Loader is a great problem-solving product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stainless steel won’t mark up your bottles. It’s light <em>and </em>durable. It’s corrosion-resistant. Plus, it’s classy. The King Cage Stainless Steel Side Loader is handmade in Durango, Colorado, by a small family-owned company using 304 USA-sourced stainless steel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out all of the cool King Cage goodies at the link below.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://kingcage.com/\">KingCage.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gettin-some-on-the-side-the-king-cage-stainless-steel-side-loader-bottle-cage-a-review/\">Gettin’ Some on the Side, the King Cage Stainless Steel Side Loader Bottle Cage, a Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f3fc62575a2536022450cecc5786bffaf1818bc84930c03704a4d53cba92b49f","category":"Cycling"}
