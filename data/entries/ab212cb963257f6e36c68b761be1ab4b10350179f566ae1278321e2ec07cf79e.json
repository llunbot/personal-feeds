We're bubbles too,\" laments the \"Romeo\" Android smartphone. \"And literally everyone wants us to be together. Ugh,\" writes Juliet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's ultimately a bit of a confusing ad, but Samsung makes it clear with the title of the video: \"Green bubbles and blue bubbles want to be together.\" Samsung also includes the \"Help Apple #GetTheMessage\" tagline and hashtag that Google has been using for its RCS campaign.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle has been hounding Apple about adopting RCS for several years now using ads, billboards, websites, social media campaigns, and more, but Apple has refused.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a communication protocol designed by and adopted by Google. Google has been pushing Apple to implement support for RCS, but Apple devices continue to support the older SMS protocol. Google claims that Apple is responsible for all the issues that Android and ‌iPhone‌ users have texting one another, including lack of encryption, broken group chats, pixelated pictures and videos, and the green bubbles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/tim-cook-on-ios-rcs-buy-your-mom-an-iphone/\">in September 2022</a> said that RCS is not a priority for Apple and that it is not a feature that ‌iPhone‌ users are asking for.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/samsung-pushes-apple-to-adopt-rcs/\">'Green Bubbles and Blue Bubbles Want to Be Together' Says Samsung Ad Pushing Apple to Adopt RCS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/green-bubbles-and-blue-bubbles-want-to-be-together-says-samsung-ad-pushing-apple-to-adopt-rcs.2406956/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab212cb963257f6e36c68b761be1ab4b10350179f566ae1278321e2ec07cf79e","category":"Apple"}
