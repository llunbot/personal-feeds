According to a recent report, the button will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/\">respond to pressure and touch</a>. For example, the report said users will be able to zoom in and out in the Camera app by swiping left and right on the button, focus with a light press, and start a video recording with a more forceful press.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe higher-end iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models are also expected to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, compared to 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIs a new button and a larger display significant or not?
