The combination of iPhone case and keyboard brings physical buttons to the Apple mobile phone and creates more space on the screen for content, as the on-screen keyboard is no longer needed, and being able to assign shortcuts to certain key combinations is an incredibly clever trick.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Price When Reviewed</p>\n<p>This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Best Pricing Today</p>\n\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div><h3>Price When Reviewed</h3><p>From $139</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: Clicks case for iPhone 16\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clicks</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$139\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.clicks.tech/products/clicks-keyboard-for-iphone-16?variant=49458123800891\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Clicks is the only keyboard case for the iPhone on the market. It is one of those accessories that will inevitably divide opinion. The concept itself isn’t stupid, it’s just a bit out of date, because the era of smartphones with keyboards came to an end with the demise of Blackberry at the latest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I’m just susceptible to such concepts, after all I belong to the (probably relatively small) group of people who spent quite a while with keyboard smartphones and look back longingly in moments of weakness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The small company has launched a revised version of the keyboard case that works with the iPhone 16. Not only was the fit adapted to the two new devices, but changes were also made to both the keyboard and the workmanship.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"clicks for iphone 16pm 2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Eugen Wegmann</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design &amp; finish</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Three colors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Good workmanship</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the keyboard at the bottom, Clicks is a standard iPhone case that comes in three colours: Surf, Spice and Onyx (aka blue, ochre and black).

With the Clicks, the already long iPhone models become <em>even</em> longer and their leverage increases when you hold them at a typical angle of 20 to 70 degrees to the ground. Even the best typing feel can’t change the fact that your wrists start to hurt after a while.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"clicks for iphone 16pm 1\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/clicks_for_iphone_16pm_1.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Size comparison: Clicks for iPhone 16 Pro Max next to an iPhone 16 Pro Max.</figcaption></figure><p>Eugen Wegmann</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The developers of the Clicks have already done a lot to bring the center of gravity as close as possible to the hands: In addition to the buttons and all the technology, there are also a few weights behind the artificial leather flap on the back. It is possible that the Clicks is more comfortable for the normal iPhone or the Pro iPhone without Max, but I can only speculate due to my lack of such a variant to test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Functions &amp; software</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keyboard shortcuts for shortcuts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clicks app for customizations and updates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C passthrough</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the actual physical keyboard, the secret superpower of Clicks is the ability to assign shortcuts to every single key. However, this requires a relatively high level of effort, as everything has to be set up. Clicks uses a function in the accessibility options to assign shortcuts, which makes it possible to control the iPhone with an external keyboard. The setup is not complicated, but lengthy. There is also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVIM96FvDY\" target=\"_blank\">a video (in English)</a> that explains everything step by step (step by step).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Clicks has now expanded the associated app so that some basic shortcuts can be set up easily. Beyond that, however, you will have to search for the corresponding shortcuts elsewhere or create them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not entirely trivial, because although the shortcut app is versatile, it is also confusing and for non-experts. One shortcut that I had to set up myself opens the Control Center, which has only been possible on the system side since iOS 18.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shortcuts that Clicks suggests in the app include starting Instagram, calling a specific contact, activating a focus mode, calculating a tip in the calculator and many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the app, you can also configure the behavior of some other buttons—such as whether the Enter key sends a message or inserts a line break—whether and when the Clicks goes into standby mode and whether and how strong the button illumination is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use your iPhone via cable in the car for Carplay, you have to switch from keyboard mode to data mode either in the app or via a key combination (123 space bar), as USB-C on the iPhone cannot do both at the same time. Nevertheless, the iPhone can also be charged with a case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Clicks connects to the iPhone via USB-C, it does not need its own battery but is powered by the iPhone. This has consequences for the iPhone’s battery life, although the manufacturer assures us that the effects are negligible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my tests, Clicks consumed between 20 and 25 per cent of the battery throughout the day according to the iOS battery consumption. On one of my test days, only “Slay the Spire” came close to this consumption, but in a much shorter time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two settings in the Clicks app to reduce the case’s power consumption: the key illumination and the power-saving mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes the most sense to switch the keyboard backlight off completely and only switch it on when needed, as it is usually the biggest power guzzler. Even in the dark, the screen glows brightly enough for the white letters on the keyboard to still be recognizable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power-saving mode, on the other hand, is a double-edged sword. The clicks are simply switched off after a certain period of time, which initially seems to make perfect sense. However, this has the disadvantage that it always takes a really strangely long moment for Clicks to switch on again and connect to the iPhone. This is particularly annoying if you pick up the iPhone after a while, want to quickly execute a short command and press the button combination three or four times before anything happens at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you’re trading a slightly longer battery life for an annoying inconvenience. Which one you choose is up to you.

The keyboard case is an absolute niche product and is aimed at productivity junkies who write a lot of long texts on their iPhone, execute a handful of shortcuts at the touch of a button and, ideally, also want to attract a little attention with their accessories in public. Clicks is also aimed at people who have never really got over the fact that smartphones with keyboards no longer exist. If you belong to either group, the Clicks is the perfect accessory for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicks is one of the more interesting accessories to hit the market for the iPhone in recent years, and the ability to assign shortcuts to all the buttons has incredible potential if you have the leisure to spend a few hours with it and set it up.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0474846a9dd2a76267bf662a2d84590614855f210708e5abee53ec5509b5e633","category":"Apple"}
