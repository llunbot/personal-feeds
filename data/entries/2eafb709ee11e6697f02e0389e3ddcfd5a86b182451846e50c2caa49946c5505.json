During this year, the company released new iPhones, AirPods, and Apple Watches, nearly updated its entire iPad line, refreshed most of its Macs, and launched a brand new device in an entirely new category. While some of these releases were naturally underwhelming, many of its newest devices offer incredible value at reasonable prices. That’s not to mention the technological advancements made across the line. With the year drawing to a close and Apple done with new hardware, we’re going to look back and highlight the six most notable releases over the past 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s vision for the future began to materialize almost immediately. Despite revealing its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2231451/apple-vision-pro-review.html\">Vision Pro</a> headset during 2023’s WWDC, the company started selling its first spatial computer in early February with a ton of hype and a lot of hope. The cutting-edge headset marked the beginning of a new chapter at Apple that’s only just getting started. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the masses haven’t adopted this $2,499 device yet, one simply can’t ignore the mind-blowing technology it packs. These include over a dozen sensors and cameras that map the physical world in real-time—with the help of the R1 and M2 chipsets. That’s in addition to its high-resolution displays that maximize user immersion when viewing supported content. Expectedly, the Vision Pro also offers tight Apple ecosystem ties, allowing you to seamlessly mirror your Mac’s display, enjoy lossless audio playback with the AirPods Pro 2, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while this headset isn’t a best seller yet, Apple could address its shortcomings by dropping its price and weight with future iterations. Regardless of how this product’s timeline unfolds, it arguably remains Cupertino’s most exciting 2024 release and a solid foundation for a potential spatial era ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad Pro M4</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next notable release followed in May, when Apple launched its thinnest consumer device yet (disregarding the Polishing Cloth). The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2414833/the-m4-ipad-pro-is-impossible.html\">M4 iPad Pro</a> manages to offer one of the sleekest tablet designs on the market while continuing to provide users with a desktop processor and potentially the fastest experience in this category. Along with the all-new tandem OLED panel, support for Apple Pencil Pro, and Nano texture display option, the iPad Pro has never been as light, slim, or powerful.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"The M4 iPad Pro held at arm's length to show its thinness\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/m4-ipad-pro-thin.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The M4 iPad Pro hides a ton of power in its ultra-thin frame.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods 4 with ANC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to September: Apple brings active noise cancelation (ANC) to its entry-level AirPods for the first time as an optional add-on that costs extra. Despite costing just $179, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">AirPods 4 with ANC</a> offer multiple perks that had been exclusive to the $249 AirPods Pro 2 variant. These include a Find My-enabled charging case, support for wireless charging through Qi and the Apple Watch puck, the Adaptive Audio feature, and more. So, customers who dislike the silicone ear tips or don’t want to spend a premium on a pair of true wireless earbuds can finally enjoy ANC and other Pro-level benefits through the entry-level AirPods 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 16 and 16 Plus</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in September, Apple then revealed the iPhone 16 series. While the Pro and Pro Max editions are undoubtedly the highest-end models, the regular <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2470661/iphone-16-and-16-plus-review.html\">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a> variants are arguably more prominent this time around. For starters, they offer 2024’s most interesting highlight—the Camera Control button—which could’ve easily been a Pro exclusive. They’ve similarly dropped the mute switch in favor of the Action button. So, beyond the thinner bezels, 120Hz refresh rate, always-on display, and telephoto rear lens (and despite their more affordable pricing), the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are pretty Pro for most users. That’s not to mention that they offer vibrant color options—as Pro iPhone users remain limited to dull, muted ones.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 Plus Device in Hand\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-Device-in-Hand.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone 16 Plus feels more like a Pro Max than ever.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Connor Jewiss / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 18</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple released a ton of innovative hardware this year, we can’t ignore the developments made in the software department, too. In late September, the firm launched the stable version of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a>, which packs a wide array of highly requested and long-overdue features. Some of our favorites include a truly customizable Home Screen and Control Center, RCS support, T9 dialing, phone call recording, Math Notes, device and notification mirroring with macOS Sequoia, a standalone Passwords app, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the centerpiece is Apple Intelligence, Apple’s first entry into the world of AI and a marriage of hardware and software like we’ve never seen before. It’s rolling out slowly over several months, but iPhone 16 and 15 Pro users already have access to an incredible suite of AI features, including Genmoji, native ChatGPT integration, Writing Tools, and notification summaries. Apple Intelligence turns iOS 18 from a great release into a groundbreaking one </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mac mini M4</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but certainly not least, Apple closest out 2024 with its biggest littlest Mac ever: the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2512911/m4-pro-mac-mini-review-remarkably-small-and-incredibly-powerful.html\">M4 Mac mini</a>. Released on October 29 with an upgraded chip and all-new design, Apple was able to significantly shrink the size of its smallest Mac for the first time in 14. So, not only does the Mac mini M4 pack some of Apple’s fastest consumer chipsets to date, but it now has an area of just 25 square inches. With the same starting price of $599 (or $499 for education), customers can now own an affordable Mac without sacrificing aesthetics or performance.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"M4 Mac mini size comparison\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 6000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-mac-mini-size.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The new Mac mini is almost as small as an Apple TV.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A year of shifts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s most prominent theme for 2024 was making the same premium devices but at a lower price of admission. The AirPods 4 with ANC, iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, and Mac mini M4 all deliver Pro-esque performance without leaving a hole in customers’ wallets. They’re all products we can confidently recommend to undecided buyers, as they no longer miss out on core or enticing features—for the most part, at least. Nevertheless, the company also continues to deliver high-end devices for those interested, such as the Pro iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and Vision headset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also shifted its software philosophy this year by opening up the iPhone. iOS is now the closest it has ever been to Android OS in terms of personalization, making it more alluring to those considering a platform switch. While the first batches of Apple Intelligence perks have been generally underwhelming, iOS 18 packs plenty of other features that elevate the release—regardless of AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 2024 out of the way, we can now anticipate next year’s releases, which are rumored to include more M4 Macs, the iPhone 17 series with an all-new Air, AirPods Pro 3, AirTag 2, fresh Apple Intelligence features, and more.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2eafb709ee11e6697f02e0389e3ddcfd5a86b182451846e50c2caa49946c5505","category":"Apple"}
