However, the plan was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/\">canceled</a> at a late stage. They were then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons/\">rumored</a> to come to the iPhone 16 Pro, before being shelved indefinitely. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOr that's what was believed at the time. It appears that Apple never fully dropped the idea, if Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital is correct. Last month, the leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-hasnt-given-up-on-haptic-buttons/\">claimed</a> Apple was still investigating haptic buttons for a future iPhone. And today the account has <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/Pue4V9WoS\">doubled down on the claim</a>, saying the project is not just active for the iPhone, but for Apple's \"entire product line,\" including iPad and Apple Watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital says it isn't the production cost that has held the project back, but rather the issue of \"mistouches,\" since an accurate response from the buttons isn't always guaranteed. The current button design is said to be integrated directly into the frame, with no rebound when clicked, but the company is apparently seeking to more closely replicate the experience of a traditional mechanical button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe project was believed to be on hold while Apple prioritized display and battery technology advancements for upcoming models. While the feature is still not expected to arrive in the iPhone 17 lineup, Project Bongo has indeed \"restarted\" at the company, according to Instant Digital.  <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">Instant Digital</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/apple-haptic-buttons-iphone-ipad-apple-watch/\">Apple Working on Haptic Buttons for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-haptic-buttons-for-iphone-ipad-apple-watch.2457922/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a48f73f976ba83ced51b0e3363a977ed96295f031d540c658a952f9a733a7866","category":"Apple"}
