After a surprising rumor claimed the new phone would have a Dynamic Island, a new report from a reliable pundit appears to largely confirm the original theory that there will be a notch at the top of the new phone’s screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussing the upcoming device on Twitter/X this week, Ross Young, a displays analyst with an <a href=\"https://appletrack.com/ross-young/\">astonishing track record</a> of accurate predictions, tersely <a href=\"https://x.com/dsccross/status/1884326503393214966\">stated</a> “Notch like iPhone 14 is correct.” Notches were used to house the selfie camera and Face ID sensors on every iPhone from X to 14. Young has a very strong track record for display rumors as he relies on supply chain reports rather than leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this rumor isn’t a new one by any means. In March 2024 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2254092/iphone-se-4-cad-leak-6-1-inch-screen-face-id-notch-camera.html\">leaked CAD renders</a> hinted at a notched design, and this has been corroborated by reports in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2475634/the-iphone-se-4-will-bring-back-the-notch-kill-the-home-button.html\">October</a> and again <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2589494/new-leak-gives-us-a-clear-look-at-the-iphone-se-4-with-a-notch.html\">a few days ago</a>. However, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2583113/new-leak-changes-everything-we-know-about-the-iphone-se-4.html\">report by Android leaker Evan Blass</a> earlier this month claimed the new phone would have a Dynamic Island instead, but we’re seeing a strong consensus build around the concept of the notch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On balance, the notch theory sounds about right. It would represent an evolution from the older Home button design that Apple used for all three previous generations of SE and which is ready for retirement in favor of a more modern look. SE owners tend to hang on to their devices for a while and a massive overhaul should be enough to encourage them to upgrade, while also capturing a fair amount of switchers tempted by the low price and Apple intelligence support. But the phone will still look mildly old-fashioned compared to the Dynamic Islands on the newest iPhones, so it shouldn’t cannibalize sales of costlier devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next iPhone is expected to be announced in March or April.
