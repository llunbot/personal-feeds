With all of the torque only driving one single gear, some designs can dig into the teeth on the freehub body, making it difficult to remove them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design uses a base sleeve that threads onto the XD body, just like you would with a cassette, and then the spacers and cog slide over that with a lock ring holding those in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still in development, with a target launch date of August 2023. Pricing is TBD, expect them to have all the same color options as their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wheels-manufacturing-nests-spacer-stacks-with-standard-pro-top-caps/\" target=\"_blank\">headset spacers</a> and other accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"purple haze anodized headset bottom bracket bearing press\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-headset-press-mystic-anodization-01.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re also playing with limited edition colors for their tools, with this multi-color anodized finish called Mystic. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"wheels mfg cassette lock ring tool for bafang hub motors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wheels-manufacturing-bafang-e-bike-hub-cassette-removal-tool-01.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last up, they’ve made a cassette lock ring tool specifically for Bafang e-bike hubs, which have a big metal plug sticking out from the axle. Typical cassette removal tools won’t fit over it, so this one has a larger center bore that will.
