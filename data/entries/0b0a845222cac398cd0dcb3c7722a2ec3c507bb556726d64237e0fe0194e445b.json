Like Remco’s 2022 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-bike-check-remcos-red-la-vuelta-winning-tarmac-sl7/\">La Vuelta winning SL7</a> and then his <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-bikes-world-champ-s-works-tarmac-sl7s-of-niamh-fischer-black-remco-evenepoel/\" target=\"_blank\">World Champ edition SL7</a> a few months later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, Specialized’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/speed-sniffer-specialized-tarmac-sl8-aero-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">latest SL8</a> lays claim to being the lightest in the peloton – at just 685g for the top-tier carbon frame. We all know that paint adds weight. But if you are already starting so light, there’s probably of plenty of wiggle room within the UCI’s 6.8kg minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t hurt that Specialized also say the SpeedSniffer headtube design makes the SL8 more aero than their previous Venge. And that it gets a “33% greater stiffness:weight” and a claimed 6% boost of smoothness while in the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Remco Evenepoel is the fastest Young Rider at the 2024 Tour de France</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We spotted both black &amp; chrome and all-black bikes for Evenepoel at this year’s Tour. Plus, Specialized shared photos of a white one later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details.jpg\" alt=\"Remco Evenepoel S-Works Tarmac SL8 of the Best Young Rider at the 2024 Tour de France, shiny bike detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_shiny-bike-details-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides white jerseys, the only thing white we really spotted on all of  Remco Evenepoel’s bikes at the Tour was white bar tape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So wait, how does the Tour de France’s Young Rider Classification work? Evenepoel is clearly young at 24. But he’s also no young up-and-coming newbie to the sport. He skipped racing as a U23 to go straight to the pro ranks, and has already won the 2022 World Championship on the road, 2023 TT Worlds, and the 2022 Vuelta a España.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_rider_classification_in_the_Tour_de_France\" target=\"_blank\">current Tour rules</a> mean since he will still be under 26 on next January 1st, he’s still considered a Young Rider this summer. And it was his first Tour de France this year. Overall Yellow Jersey winner Tadej Pogačar is currently 25, but will be 26 in a couple months. But don’t lose sleep for Pogačar, he’s won the White Jersey a record 4x.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

helped Evenepoel find the exact fit that he wanted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has pretty slick integration with the team’s custom Wolfpack out-front GPS mounts made for them by K-Edge. And tidy cable integration that exists just under the stem, before tucking into the special upper headset bearing cap for easier adjustment by mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs.jpg\" alt=\"Remco Evenepoel S-Works Tarmac SL8 of the Best Young Rider at the 2024 Tour de France, shiny hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Remco-Evenepoel-S-Works-Tarmac-SL8_Best-Young-Rider-2024-Tour-de-France_silver-hubs-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One more shiny detail… even Remco’s hubs are polished silver.
