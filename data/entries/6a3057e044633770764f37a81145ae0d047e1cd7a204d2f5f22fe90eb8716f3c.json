But with great choice can come great confusion. There are a number of key criteria it is well worth thinking about to ensure that a power meter is a good fit for a given type of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some power meters offer more versatility across disciplines, while others are more specialised to, say, road-based time-trialling. Here are some of the most important attributes to look out for when making a decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/45k9L2s\" target=\"_blank\">Discover more</a> about Favero’s Assioma Pro MX power meter pedals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compatibility, type and portability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days when riding a performance bike relied merely on feel and instinct. Nowadays, your power meter will need to connect to a head unit, smart trainers and other tech – plus, whether it’s pedal-, crank- or hub-based will determine how easy is it to port across to different bikes or to travel with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also important to decide which type of cleats you will be riding. Road cleats are really only suitable for road-based riding where you won’t encounter much mud or debris, while SPD cleat systems can happily be used on the road or off-road.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/favero-assioma-3-2.jpg 976w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As well as having a dedicated app packed with data, the Favero Assioma power meter range is compatible with all major third party applications including Zwift, Strava, Bkool, TrainerRoad, Rouvy and others, and will connect to indoor trainers and head units via Bluetooth and ANT+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they are a pedal-based power meter, removing and porting to new bikes is as easy as removing an ordinary pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring a bike for a holiday abroad? You won’t have to sacrifice any power meter data, as the Assioma pedals can travel too. This provides a significant advantage over crank-based power meters in terms of versatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Favero power meter exists both for road and off-road, offering versions compatible with Look cleats as well as Shimano SPD=SL and SPD systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accuracy and data</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it’s every cyclist’s worst nightmare to think that our efforts aren’t being adequately rewarded. Any rider who has ever looked down to check whether or not a brake pad is rubbing, only to discover that it’s their legs that are the problem, will be familiar with this feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ensuring your chosen power meter has adequate accuracy and power readings is sure to be a key component of any decision. But some power meters will go beyond just these basic measurements and offer deeper insight into how riders are performing on the bike.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-studio-1-970x600.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-studio-1-970x600.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-studio-1-300x186.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-studio-1-768x475.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-studio-1-750x464.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-studio-1-1140x705.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-studio-1.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With ±1% accuracy and the option for dual-side readings, Favero Assioma pedals are towards the top of this category. In addition to accurately recording power output, the Assioma pedals keep track of left/right balance, cadence, power phases, power phase of the pedal stroke, and pedal smoothness. platform centre offset (force distribution across the pedal). Compared to the road-based Assioma Duo, the off-road-focussed <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45k9L2s\" target=\"_blank\">Assioma Pro MX</a> also offers the additional metric of platform center offset, which measures force distribution across the pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These different data points can help riders fine-tune the roundness of their pedal stroke and cleat positioning, both of which can help improve performance and prevent repetitive injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Battery life, weight and durability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different types of riders and riding will have different battery life requirements. Riders off on multiday adventures into the wilderness will have different considerations to dedicated roadies who ride for short, sharp blasts as part of their local chaingang. But if you can have longer battery life without sacrificing weight or accuracy, then it certainly makes life easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different types of power meter use different types of battery. Some are disposable cell-batteries, some need to be removed to be charged, while others can be charged on the bike. Rechargeable batteries have the benefit of being less susceptible to power dropouts than their disposable counterparts. Battery type will also contribute to a pedal’s overall weight, which is a factor for every kind of cycling kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With any investment in high-performing equipment, especially that which is going to be used on unpredictable terrain, you want to be sure your device is going to withstand some wear and tear. With power meters, this means thinking about where the electronics and more fragile elements are going to be housed, and whether they will be able to withstand heavy treatment from bumps and tree roots.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Favero Assioma\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/favero-assioma-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Favero</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In terms of all-round capacity, the Favero Assioma Pro MX pedals have strong technical credentials in these areas. Its rechargeable batteries can be charged while still on the bike, from the mains or a power bank, with a full charge providing 60 hours of runtime, while the 191.4g weight of each pedal is light next to competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the electrics of the Assioma pedals are concealed in its water-tight spindle, which has a number of benefits. The vital electronics are totally protected, the weight of the pedal is concentrated centrally, and the lightweight aluminium pedal body – if ever damaged – can be replaced at a fraction of the cost of the entire pedal system. It’s a pedal that is designed to stand up to some robust treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price and feedback</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final key metric to consider during power meter research is price, as well as how the power meters perform on review. Some power meters come included with the purchase of new electronic groupsets but, as mentioned, that can limit portability because it is far more difficult to remove a crank-based power meter. It’s also important to note that moving from single to dual-sided power can add a significant cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At £322.61 for a single-sided power meter (MX-1) and £484.33 for a double (MX-2) with free shipping, the Favero Assioma Pro MX pedals are very competitively priced, especially considering their nods to durability and resilience and the availability of affordable replacement parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Make the right choice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are lots of different areas of specialisation for power meters, it is possible to get the best of many different worlds in just one system. Deciding which of these criteria is most important for your type of riding will help inform any decision about purchasing a power meter as you upgrade your riding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Favero Assioma Pro MX range:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Favero Assioma Pro MX-2 | <a href=\"https://cycling.favero.com/en/shop/assiomapromx2\" target=\"_blank\">£484.33</a></strong><br />Dual-sided power meter pedals for MTB XC, gravel and CX</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Favero Assioma Pro MX-1 | <a href=\"https://cycling.favero.com/en/shop/assiomapromx1\" target=\"_blank\">£322.61</a></strong><br />Single-sided power meter pedals for MTB XC, gravel and CX</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45k9L2s\" target=\"_blank\">Discover more</a> about Favero’s Assioma Pro MX power meter pedals</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/choosing-power-meter-pedals-favero-assioma-pro-mx\">How to choose the right power meter pedals for you</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6a3057e044633770764f37a81145ae0d047e1cd7a204d2f5f22fe90eb8716f3c","category":"Cycling"}
