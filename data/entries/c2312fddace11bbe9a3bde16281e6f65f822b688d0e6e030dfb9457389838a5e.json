Verizon agreed to both rules and gained significant benefits in return—first in 2008 when it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/05/verizon-we-promise-to-honor-the-block-c-open-access-rules/\">purchased licenses</a> to use 700 MHz spectrum that came with <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/27.16\">open access requirements</a> and in 2021 when it agreed to <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-21-121A1.pdf\">merger conditions</a> in order to obtain approval for its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/verizon-to-buy-tracfone-expanding-big-carriers-control-of-prepaid-industry/\">purchase of TracFone</a>.</p>\n<p>The Biden-era Federal Communications Commission last year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/fcc-blasts-t-mobiles-365-day-phone-locking-proposes-60-day-unlock-rule/\">proposed</a> a 60-day unlocking requirement that would apply to all wireless providers, which would have made AT&amp;T and T-Mobile follow the same unlocking timeframe as Verizon. But now that the FCC is chaired by Republican Brendan Carr, it's looking to eliminate telecom regulations instead of making them stricter. Verizon sees this as an opening to seek an end to its unlocking obligations.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/verizon-tries-to-get-out-of-merger-condition-requiring-it-to-unlock-phones/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/verizon-tries-to-get-out-of-merger-condition-requiring-it-to-unlock-phones/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2312fddace11bbe9a3bde16281e6f65f822b688d0e6e030dfb9457389838a5e","category":"Tech"}
