The\nbill, called <a href=\"https://cammack.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/cammack.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/app-store-freedom-119.pdf\">the App Store Freedom Act</a>, aims to “promote\ncompetition and protect consumers and developers in the mobile\napp marketplace,” according to a <a href=\"https://cammack.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-cammack-introduces-app-store-freedom-act-promote-competition-protect\">press release on\nTuesday</a>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>It would also require Apple and Google to offer developers “equal\naccess to interfaces, features, and development tools without cost\nor discrimination,” as well as allow users to remove or hide\npre-installed apps. Violations of the bill would result in\npenalties from the Federal Trade Commission, along with an\nadditional civil penalty of up to $1 million for each violation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a stunt from the Epic/Spotify-backed <a href=\"https://appfairness.org/\">Coalition for App Fairness</a> that we’ll probably never hear about again.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/06/cammack-app-store-freedom-act\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f969c4663e4b7d646449e94cdf879fc8f88680b144c265470e3be83c76f1a412","category":"Tech"}
