Rumors say that a redesigned Mac mini is on the way, along with a refreshed iMac and MacBook Pros. But according to a new leak, the most exciting upgrade might be to one of 2024‚Äôs most maligned models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple introduced the 14-inch M3 Macbook Pro in October 2023 to replace the aging 13-inch model. It brought a design to match the high-end models, along with a ProMotion display and extra ports, including HDMI and an SD card slot.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At $1,599, it was significantly cheaper than the M3 Pro models that started at $1,999, but there were a few things that kept it from being a good option for pro users on a budget. For one, it has just 8GB of RAM, the same as the MacBook Air. For another, it only has two Thunderbolt ports. And finally, it doesn‚Äôt come in the cool new Space Black color.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>M4 14‚Äù Macbook Pro ? <br />Not confirmed, take it with a pin of salt.

An alleged snap of the box for the new M4 MacBook Pro shows a model with 16GB of RAM, three Thunderbolt ports, and a Space Black color option. The known leaker says they were sent the image, which is low resolution but appears to be legitimate. As a <a href=\"https://x.com/tgod34748/status/1840379511881314346?s=61\" target=\"_blank\">reply</a> to the original post points out, the box contains a QR code which Apple only began doing with the iPhone 16 phones. Additionally, the security strip is still intact, as are the chip specs. While the M3 Pro and Max MacBook come with 18GB of RAM, it‚Äôs likely the base model will have 16GB like the Airs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple keeps the price at the same $1,599, the M4 MacBook Pro will be a compelling option for pros and non-pros alike. Compared to the $1,499 MacBook Air, it will have a higher-end display that‚Äôs just an inch smaller, more RAM, more ports, and better battery life. It would also represent the first time in a while that Apple made an entry-level Pro machine that wasn‚Äôt hampered to cut costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to launch the new Macs at an event in October, possibly alongside a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fa348c15559744a02f09a04389d35505120481cfcc81516fb828d85a51c5d4b9","category":"Apple"}
