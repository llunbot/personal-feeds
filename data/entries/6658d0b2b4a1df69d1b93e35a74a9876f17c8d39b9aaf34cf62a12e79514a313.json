Apple already announced this capability, but it had not provided the wattage information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond, the document reveals that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support USB 3.2 Gen 2 for data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps. Apple had already revealed that the devices support USB 3, but the exact specification is now confirmed. The USB-C cable included with iPhone 15 Pro models supports USB 2 speeds, so a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU883AM/A/thunderbolt-4-usb%E2%80%91c-pro-cable-1-m\">higher-spec cable</a> is needed for faster speeds. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs we previously reported, the document indicates that all iPhone 15 models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/all-iphone-15-models-support-displayport/\">support DisplayPort</a> for up to 4K HDR video mirroring to an external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable, or an adapter. However, unlike select iPad models with Stage Manager, the iPhone lacks an extended display mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 15 Pro models also support recording ProRes video <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-external-storage-prores/\">directly to an external storage device</a>, at up to 4K and 60 frames per second.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo connect an iPhone 15 to a vehicle with a USB-A port for wired CarPlay usage, Apple says customers can use a USB-C to USB-A cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdditional information is outlined in the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213839\">support document</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/16/iphone-15-usb-c-port-details/\">iPhone 15's USB-C Port: 4.5W Charging for Accessories, USB 3.2 Gen 2 for Pro Models, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-usb-c-port-4-5w-charging-for-accessories-usb-3-2-gen-2-for-pro-models-and-more.2402440/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6658d0b2b4a1df69d1b93e35a74a9876f17c8d39b9aaf34cf62a12e79514a313","category":"Apple"}
