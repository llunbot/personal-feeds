The latest reminder of the group’s proficiency comes from security firm Mandiant, which on Monday <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/russian-targeting-gov-business\">published research</a> detailing Nobelium’s numerous feats—and a few mistakes—as it continued to breach the networks of some of its highest-value targets.</p>\n<h2>Abusing trust</h2>\n<p>One of the things that made Nobelium so formidable was the creativity of its TTPs, hacker lingo for tactics, techniques, and procedures.
