bikes and features an interview of Steve Jobs in 1981 on ABC News. In the footage, Jobs praises man’s creation of the bicycle as an amplification of our abilities. Michael B Clifford, who directed <em>Chasing the Sun</em>, wants the film to leave people questioning how they use energy, how much they can change, and how far they can go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claire Carter, Artistic Director at Kendal Mountain Festival, said: ‘<em>Chasing the Sun</em> is a film that brings to life the myriad ways the humble bicycle can positively impact all our lives and indeed our precious environment, one pedal stroke at a time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kendal Mountain Festival that will show the premiere of <em>Chasing the Sun</em> is billed as ‘the UK’s biggest adventure festival’ and held over four days in Kendal, Cumbria while hosting over 23,000 visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CTS-Film-Poster-970x543.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CTS-Film-Poster-970x543.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CTS-Film-Poster-300x168.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CTS-Film-Poster-768x430.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CTS-Film-Poster-750x420.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CTS-Film-Poster-1140x638.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CTS-Film-Poster.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Book your tickets for the World Premiere <a href=\"https://tickets.kendalmountainfestival.com/events/17-11-2023-21-00-chasing-the-sun-feature-film\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/chasing-the-sun-documentary\">New Chasing the Sun documentary celebrates the inherent brilliance of the bicycle</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"157084a0f1400db84d7cb8f434dd9af95e62fe13c9168400d44909a27896eb12","category":"Cycling"}
