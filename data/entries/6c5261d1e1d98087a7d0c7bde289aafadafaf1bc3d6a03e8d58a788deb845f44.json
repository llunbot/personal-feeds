It’s lighter, sleeker, and faster than anything they’ve done before, and they’ve got the wind tunnel data and World Tour wins to back it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prologo Predator 01TT: A TT Saddle Without Compromise</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear-.png\"><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear-.png\" alt=\"Prologo Predator 01TT rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear-.png 3840w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear--297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear--1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear--120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear--768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear--2048x1152.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-rear--1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Predator 01TT is the culmination of 18 months of work with the sport’s most obsessive fitters and aerodynamicists. At 135g (narrow version), it is light enough for your lightest road bikes. But priced at €1250, it’s already as expensive as a pretty solid entry-level road bike. Add to that a low-profile design, aero shaping, and an integrated mounting system, and you’re looking at an actual marginal gains machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Predator 01TT Tour\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Tour--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Prologo didn’t build this thing in a vacuum. They teamed up with UAE Team Emirates, Visma | Lease a Bike, and Ineos Grenadiers to refine every millimeter. Tadej Pogačar rode the prototype (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tadej-pogacar-tt-tricked-out-colnago-tt1-time-trial-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">which had some extra side vents</a>) to a Tour de France win last summer, and Jonas Vingegaard crushed time trials with it in early 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Not a Rail, But An Aero Plate</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-.png\"><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-.png\" alt=\"Prologo Predator 01TT full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-.png 3840w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full--297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full--1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full--120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full--768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full--2048x1152.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full--1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most eyebrow-raising details on the Predator is the saddle’s fully integrated carbon “rail”, which Prologo insists we stop calling a rail. It’s really a wide, flat carbon plate. And it serves more than just looks—it’s said to boost power transfer, improve ride feel, and shield your clamp hardware from airflow. Plus, the setup is modular and recyclable, so you can service it (or eventually recycle it) instead of tossing it (<em>when you are done with the most expensive saddle you’ve ever bought</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Form Meets Function—Plus Speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back-.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back--1536x864.png\" alt=\"Prologo Predator 01TT full back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back--1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back--297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back--120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back--768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back--2048x1152.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-full-back--1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Prologo leveraged CFD modeling and wind tunnel testing to perfect the 01TT’s aero profile. Side wings on the saddle base smooth airflow around the clamp zone. The sharp, channeled tail guides turbulent air from the rider’s back into a more laminar stream. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In plain English: less drag, fewer watts needed by the rider, more speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top-.png\"><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top-.png\" alt=\"Prologo Predator 01TT rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top-.png 3840w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top--297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top--1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top--120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top--768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top--2048x1152.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-top--1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, it’s not all go-fast. The wide PAS channel cuts pressure on soft tissue, and the EVA padding keeps things reasonably plush for a TT saddle. And yes, it’s compact: 260mm long and 110mm wide, with the padded area measuring just 170mm long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fit for Aero Nerds of All Shapes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2.webp\"><img width=\"2160\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Predator 01TT Windtunneltest Jonas-2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2.webp 2160w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Prologo-Predator-01TT-Windtunneltest-Jonas-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Prologo knows fit is everything in TT land, so the Predator 01TT comes in two sizes. versions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Narrow with a 50mm nose (135g)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wide with a 60mm nose (159g) for a little more padding, wider contact area, and greater long-haul comfort</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both share the same shell and overall dimensions. But with the wider version, there is more nose real estate to sit on if needed, especially helpful for TT racers who spend as much time further forward as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prologo Predator 01TT – Details, Specs, and Pricing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 260x110mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nose Widths:</strong> 50mm narrow or 60mm wide</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shape: </strong>Flat</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 135g (Narrow) / 159g (Wide)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Materials: </strong>Carbon base &amp; plate, EVA padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mount:</strong> Includes a dedicated clamp compatible with most seatposts</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $1400 / 1250€</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong><a href=\"https://www.prologo.it\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>Online and in select Prologo retailer shops soon</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://prologo.it/en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Prologo.it</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prologo-predator-01tt/\">Prologo’s €1250 Predator 01TT is the World Tour’s Top Time Trial Saddle </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6c5261d1e1d98087a7d0c7bde289aafadafaf1bc3d6a03e8d58a788deb845f44","category":"Cycling"}
