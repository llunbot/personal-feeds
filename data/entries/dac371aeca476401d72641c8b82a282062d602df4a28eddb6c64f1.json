It’s traditionally the first opportunity for Tour de France hopefuls to stretch their legs and give us a hint of their form coming into spring.</p>\n<p>This year’s edition features two mountain-top finishes and, notably, a 32km team <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trial</a> – a discipline not seen in Paris-Nice for more than 30 years.</p>\n<p>The team time trial is also being run in a new and exciting format. The absence of any prologue or individual time trial means GC contenders will likely have to wait until the final weekend of the race to nail their chances of victory.</p>\n<h2>Paris-Nice 2023 schedule and race favourites</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Could Daniel Felipe Martinez turn his third-place finish into a win?</span></figcaption><span> <i>FRANCK FIFE/AFP via Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2023 edition of Paris-Nice begins in La Verrière on 5 March and finishes in (you guessed it) Nice on 12 March, having covered 1,201km in the process.</p>\n<p>With the most significant climbs stacked towards the end of the race, we’re expecting an exciting finale.</p>\n<p>The stage 3 team time trial follows a different format than normal, with the teams’ final time check being taken on the first rider to cross the line, rather than the fourth or fifth as is commonplace.</p>\n<p>This could see teams employing interesting tactics. Could they use up sacrificial riders earlier on in an attempt to lead their GC favourites towards glory? Or will they stick together as an aero juggernaut?</p>\n<p>Time trial stages have often been accused of lacking the excitement of regular road stages, but we’re expecting this one to be too good to miss.</p>\n<h3>Jonas Vingegaard</h3>\n<p>With 2022 winner Primoz Roglič absent from the start sheet this year, it’s down to his team-mate and reigning Tour De France victor Jonas Vingegaard to lead Jumbo-Visma.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard hasn’t had a huge amount of racing in his calendar since his Tour win last year, but reports suggest he has performed well in training and is well prepared for a showdown with Pogačar on the climbs of Paris-Nice.</p>\n<h3>Tadej Pogačar</h3>\n<p>If we’ve learned anything in the last few seasons of bike racing, it’s not to rule out Tadej Pogačar.</p>\n<p>The young Slovenian has recently confirmed he will not defend his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-to-watch-strade-bianche/\">Strade Bianche</a> win in order to aid his preparation for Paris-Nice. Based on their performances in previous races, we can expect some great battles between Pogačar and Vingegaard</p>\n<h3>Daniel Martinez</h3>\n<p>With most of the attention surrounding the two main favourites, it’s easy to discount some strong but less emphatic riders</p>\n<p>Daniel Martinez had a strong start to 2022, finishing third overall in last year’s Paris-Nice. The Ineos-Grenadiers rider will be looking to replicate or build on that form this year. Should any issues befall Pogačar and Vingegaard, expect Martinez to be ready to pick up the pieces.</p>\n<h2>How can I watch Paris-Nice 2023 live in the UK?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The racing kicks off on 5 March.</span></figcaption><span> <i>FRANCK FIFE/AFP via Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Eurosport will show live coverage of the 2023 Paris-Nice.</p>\n<p>TV coverage will be on  Eurosport 2, and as usual, there’s an on-demand option.
