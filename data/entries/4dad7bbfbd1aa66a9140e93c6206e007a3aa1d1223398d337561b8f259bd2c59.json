What I didn't know at the time was how quickly I'd feel <em>nostalgic</em> for its quality and pacing.</p>\n<p>That's how I felt after <em>Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins</em>, which I went into with next to zero expectations. The trailers looked fun! Charm volcano Henry Golding (<em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>) as an action star sounded intriguing! And it couldn't be worse than the previous <em>G.I. Joe</em> movie, right? Right?</p>\n<p>Sadly, <em>Snake Eyes</em> takes the uneven formula, momentum, writing, and acting of <em>Mortal Kombat 2021</em> and turns down the expectations dial in every department imaginable. By the end, <em>Snake Eyes</em> dampens its own so-bad-it's-good potential, in case you hoped to at least laugh and cheer while watching your favorite childhood action figures.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782476#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782476&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4dad7bbfbd1aa66a9140e93c6206e007a3aa1d1223398d337561b8f259bd2c59","category":"Tech"}
