After reaching out to a variety of bag makers, requesting a “custom” bag for my Rasket, the team at <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/\" target=\"_blank\">Wizard Works</a> threw its wizard cap into the arena and offered to help me out. Well, after a few months, <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/shop/bags/basket-and-rack-bags/alakazam-basket-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">my Alakazam bag</a> designed specifically to the dimensions of the Raskett, showed up and I shot some initial photos of this nifty bag this morning, so let’s check it out in detail below!<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Perhaps the only downside to the Pelago Rasket platform is it uses a non-standard — i.e. non-Wald basket size — basket. Yet, this custom Alakazam fits it like a glove.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Alakazam fills out the rounded corners with its VX/Cordura fabric construction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It secures to the basket via G-buckle metal hooks and adjusts with a slip clip.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The flap on top pulls back, exposing the velcro secure strips. The clips attach to extra straps for carrying large cargo because <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/carryshitolympics/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">#carryshitolympics</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The roll-top opens to a cavernous capacity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/A-Look-at-the-Wizard-Works-Alakazam-for-the-Pelago-Rasket-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This rolltop closes with buttons and rolls down, allowing the main flap to secure the contents.

Wizard Works’ Alakazam currently comes in two models for the Wald 137 with a 9-38L capacity and a Wald 139 20-70L capacity. The Rasket bag is somewhere in between those sizes, somewhere in the 15-50L range. Right now, I’m currently using this bike as a grocery getter and bike shop cruiser, so the Alakazam will be hauling food, parts, tires, etc, although I do believe this would make for a great basketpacking option for a S24O or the like.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure if Harry and the Wizard Works crew will be offering this option — I don’t see why they wouldn’t? — so maybe drop them a line if you have a Rasket and see what they say! This bag cost me £179 plus DHL Worldwide shipping, so make sure you’re willing to pay a premium for a premium product made in the UK by the sorcerers at <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/shop/bags/basket-and-rack-bags/alakazam-basket-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">Wizard Works</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why We Love the Wizard Works Alakazam</strong></p>\n<p>-Made in the UK<br />\n-Custom colors<br />\n-High capacity<br />\n-Secure on rough terrain thanks to secure straps<br />\n-Portageable with extra straps</p>\n<p>Got questions?
