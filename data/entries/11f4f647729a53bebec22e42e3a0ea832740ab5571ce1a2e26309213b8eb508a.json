{"title":"‘Shareware Heroes’ by Richard Moss","link":"https://sharewareheroes.com/","date":1681439721000,"content":"\n<p>From Richard Moss, author of the excellent <a href=\"https://secrethistoryofmacgaming.com/\"><em>The Secret History of Mac Gaming</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Shareware Heroes</em> takes readers on a journey through a critical\nyet long overlooked chapter in video game history: the rise and\neventual fall of the shareware model.</p>\n\n<p>As commercial game distribution professionalised in the 1980s,\nindependent creators with scant resources or contacts were\nsqueezed out of the market. But not entirely. New technologies and\ndistribution concepts were creating a hidden games publishing\nmarket — one that operated by different rules and that, at least\nfor the first several years, had no powerful giants.</p>\n\n<p>It was a land of opportunity and promise, and a glimpse of the\ndigital-first future. This is the story of the games and\ndevelopers who relied on nascent networking technologies combined\nwith word-of-mouth marketing in an era before social media.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a fun website Moss made for this. It’s just perfect. He’s got <a href=\"https://sharewareheroes.com/doomed.html\">a preview from the chapter on Id Software’s Doom</a> to whet your appetite. The book is available in hardcover, paperback, audio book, and e-book formats.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/13/shareware-heroes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"11f4f647729a53bebec22e42e3a0ea832740ab5571ce1a2e26309213b8eb508a","category":"Tech"}
