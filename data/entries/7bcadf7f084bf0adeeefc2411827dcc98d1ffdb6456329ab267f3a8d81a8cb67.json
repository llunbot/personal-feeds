My guest today is John Harrison, a long-time Parlee fan and tech turnaround guy who saw an opportunity to breathe new life into the legendary drop bar brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about what led to Parlee’s bankruptcy, what they learned from it, and more importantly where the brand is headed and what new bikes are on the horizon!</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>It’s a great chat, and if you’re a fan of the brand like I am, it’s definitely a big sigh of relief to see that they’re building a company that’s focused on smart growth and continuing their heritage of premium bikes and forward-thinking designs. I’m excited to see them back in action and to know that Bob Parlee is still involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the official press release and more images <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/parlee-cycles-is-back-w-new-owner-same-advanced-vision/\">in this post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>This Episode Sponsored by:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead Karoo 2 cycling computer ad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250.jpg 970w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-297x77.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-800x206.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-120x31.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-768x198.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hammerhead Karoo 2 is the most advanced GPS cycling computer available today, with industry-leading mapping, navigation, and routing capabilities that set it apart from other GPS options.
