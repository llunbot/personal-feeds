So take your helmet off, put the kettle on and get ready… the Tour is coming! And Carlton’s here to explain it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 6:25.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/108-carlton-kirby-tour-de-france-2024-special\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 108 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know <em>Cyclist</em> is also stunning monthly magazine?
