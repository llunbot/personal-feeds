Today, Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton announced <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-2/\">the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</a>, a new $15 product that puts the processor from the Raspberry Pi 3 into a board the exact same size as the original Zero.</p>\n<p>The new board swaps the old Zero's 1 GHz single-core ARM11 processor for a quad-core Cortex A53-based Broadcom BCM2710A1 processor, also clocked at 1 GHz—the same processor used in the original Raspberry Pi 3 released back in 2016, albeit clocked slightly lower. This is a substantial increase in power and capability for the Pi Zero, going from one core to four and from 32 bits to 64.</p>\n<p>Upton said that the performance increase over the original Zero \"varies across workloads\" but that for multithreaded tasks like those simulated by <a href=\"https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench\">sysbench</a>, \"it is almost exactly five times faster.\" Heat dissipation is provided by \"thick internal copper layers\" in the board, which should help prevent thermal throttling without the use of additional fans or heatsinks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808391#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808391&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b59ee34d94e20a988968e2180c4504f8777e433dec926300ae8b8cecd021124f","category":"Tech"}
