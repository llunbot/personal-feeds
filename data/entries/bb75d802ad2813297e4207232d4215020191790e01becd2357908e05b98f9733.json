It’s back! The DCR Cave SUMMER Open House! With the event right around the corner, we have lots to do, but first, we need to know how many beers to buy! So don’t wait around, go ahead and get registered now! This is our 9th open house (plus the summer one we did back in July, 2019).</p>\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2014/12/random-things-i-did-this-weekend-10.html#1-the-dcr-open-house\">the first</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2015/12/annual-houserecap-photos.html\">second</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/12/annual-open-houserecap-photos.html\">third</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/12/annual-house-photos.html\">fourth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2018/12/dcr-open-house-amsterdam-2018-recap-photos-and-videos.html\">fifth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/07/summer-open-house-ride-photos.html\">1st summer edition</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/12/house-winter-photo.html\">sixth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/12/dcr-open-house-winter-photo-recap.html\">seventh</a>, annnd <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/12/rainmaker-open-house-recap.html\">eighth</a> DCR Open Houses!</p>\n<p>In the past, the Open House event has hosted up to 200 people, where we typically cap registrations. Open House slots fill up super quick, though we will keep a waitlist, just in case a registrant decides they don’t want free beer and giveaways (what?).</p>\n<p>As with all years, the event is broken up into two basic pieces: The morning run, and the evening open house party. First up in the morning, we’ll head out for a group run. We’ve been mostly lucky each year with the winter weather… so hopefully the Dutch weather gods can keep it together for some beautiful summer temps as well! The run is ‘no-drop’, so nobody is left behind, and we’ll do about 10KM at a fun pace, stopping to take a few photos along the way. We are exploring a really fun new starting location this year, so be sure to double-check the run event info when the registration email comes out, even if you are a repeat participant!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/RUN-FUN.jpeg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/RUN-FUN.jpeg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/RUN-FUN-200x150.jpeg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/RUN-FUN-720x540.jpeg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/RUN-FUN-125x94.jpeg 125w\" /></p>\n<p>After that, it’s a great time to explore Amsterdam for the day, especially if you’re coming from out of town (we usually get about 30-40% of folks from out of town!). A lot of people make a fun weekend out of it. Come in Friday after work, enjoy the Amsterdam nightlife, do a morning run, and then spend the weekend seeing the sights. Your significant other is more than welcome at the Open House as well!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/12/2018-12-01-21.20.07_thumb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/12/2018-12-01-21.20.07_thumb.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/12/2018-12-01-21.20.07_thumb-124x82.jpg 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/12/2018-12-01-21.20.07_thumb-200x132.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/12/2018-12-01-21.20.07_thumb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/12/2018-12-01-21.20.07_thumb-278x185.jpg 278w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/12/2018-12-01-21.20.07_thumb-125x83.jpg 125w\" /></p>\n<p>The open house portion is where you’ll explore the DCR Cave, and all the goodness inside of it. You’re welcome to come check out all the cool gear and test out a smart bike or two! Or, you can just stare into the ever-bright overkill amount of studio lights.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2019/07/2019-07-13-12.30.53_thumb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2019/07/2019-07-13-12.30.53_thumb.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2019/07/2019-07-13-12.30.53_thumb-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2019/07/2019-07-13-12.30.53_thumb-125x94.jpg 125w\" /></p>\n<p>Like we have done in the past, we will do a sort of sports tech talk, including a bulky Q&amp;A section for all your questions. So start thinking about all the things tech-geek you want to know!</p>\n<p>Of course – there’s an endless supply of beer and wine. This past winter event we had a local craft brewer create an IPA for the event, titled “IP-Ray”, and that was a huge hit. So we have wrangled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brouwerij_beetje\">Brouwerij Beetje</a> again for some Summer IPAs and Amber Brews.  Oh, and the instigator serving all those beers is <a href=\"http://www.Instagram.com/bbmaker\">The Girl</a> – she will be holding down her longtime-assumed role for the evening: Bartending.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER-720x480.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER-200x132.jpeg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER-124x82.jpeg 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER-278x185.jpeg 278w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER-125x83.jpeg 125w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/DCR-BEER.jpeg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>Plus of course, everyone can just chat and catch up. With a few special guests roaming around, and myself, we will be ready for all the geek-talk you can imagine!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops-720x480.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops-200x132.jpeg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops-124x82.jpeg 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops-278x185.jpeg 278w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops-125x83.jpeg 125w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/06/oops.jpeg 1438w\" /></p>\n<p>And lastly, we’ll have a giveaway.

While the famous IAmsterdam sign in front of the Rijksmuseum is no longer there (in 2018 we managed a group photo the day before they removed it!), we’ll certainly try and find an equally iconic spot for the annual group photo.</p>\n<p>Like years past we’ll have a place for you to store any bags/clothes/Haribo you want to leave during the run. And again, we’ll leave nobody behind on the run – so fear not!</p>\n<h3><span>Get Registered!</span></h3>\n<p>For the open house simply use the form below to sign-up (just so we can figure out how much cheese, beer, and wine to buy…and snacks to make!). We’re using a different registration system this year, which I hope will make things way easier (mainly for me, but also for you). If you want to register multiple people (such as your lovely significant other), you can do that via adding a second ticket, or just filling out the form twice – once in their name. Plus, it’ll make it easier for us to send you updates along the way.</p>\n<p>Remember we also have DCR products for sale on the website, which you can pick up at the door of the event on July 13th. Which is effectively a free shipping bonus! (VERY SORRY, but please do not purchase and ask us to mail to you, we just aren’t set up for that).</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dc-rainmaker.myshopify.com/\">SIGN-UP HERE</a>!</strong></p>\n<p>I’ll use the e-mail provided to send the final details (and a reminder) as we get closer to the date. See ya there!</p>\n<p><em>Note: Folks from various sports tech companies are of course more than welcome! Just be sure to bring enough devices for everyone. Kidding! For real, you’re more than welcome to come!</em></p>","author":"The Girl","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"bb75d802ad2813297e4207232d4215020191790e01becd2357908e05b98f9733","category":"Cycling"}
