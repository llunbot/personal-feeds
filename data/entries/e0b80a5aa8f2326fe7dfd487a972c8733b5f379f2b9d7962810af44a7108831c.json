Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said:<blockquote>Apple silicon has taken the Mac to unprecedented heights, and the rapid pace of innovation continues with M4 Pro and M4 Max. With the world's fastest CPU core, immensely more powerful GPUs, and the fastest Neural Engine ever, the power-efficient performance and capabilities of the M4 family extend its lead as the most advanced lineup of chips in the industry.</blockquote>The M4 Max's 16-core CPU contains 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores, making it 2.2x faster than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a>. The GPU contains up to 40 cores for performance up to 1.9x faster than the ‌M1 Max‌. The M4 Max supports up to 128GB of unified memory with up to 546GB/s of memory bandwidth. The chip also contains an enhanced Media Engine with two video encode engines and two ProRes accelerators. Like the M4 Pro chip, the M4 Max supports Thunderbolt 5 with up to 120Gb/s data transfer capability. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nApple also today <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-m4-pro-and-m4-max/\">drew attention</a> to the M4 and M4 Pro chip, with the M4 Max completing the new chip lineup.
