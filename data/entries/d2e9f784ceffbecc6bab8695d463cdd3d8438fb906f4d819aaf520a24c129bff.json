But then, suddenly, something went wrong with this Centaur upper stage.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the incident, to his credit, the chief executive of United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, was quick to acknowledge <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1641270272987676672\">on Twitter</a> that something had happened: \"Keeping you posted: During Qual testing of Centaur V structural article at MSFC, the hardware experienced an anomaly.\"</p>\n<p>Unpacking this tweet a little bit, Bruno is saying that during qualification testing—the process of testing rocket engines and stages on the ground to determine their behavior during flight-like conditions—the Centaur stage had a problem. More than a week later, however, there are more questions than answers about the accident.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929875#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929875&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d2e9f784ceffbecc6bab8695d463cdd3d8438fb906f4d819aaf520a24c129bff","category":"Tech"}
