I can only assume I’m going through a cycling midlife crisis as I swing between acting my age and refusing to grow up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there’s my trip to the Scottish island of Islay – undertaken last summer – where the challenge is less about scaling epic peaks and more about getting around as many distilleries as possible before the last ferry departs. This is me in full-on old buffer mode, and it’s the kind of thing that a younger me would have rolled my eyes at – a bunch of guys pootling around on bikes, tasting malt whisky and gassing about smoky top notes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/watch-liege-bastogne-liege\">How to watch and live stream Liège-Bastogne-Liège 2023</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-road-bike\">What is a road bike?

It’s just about the closest thing to a mountain bike that this magazine has ever featured (it says it’s a gravel bike, but the suspension fork and dropper post would suggest otherwise) and saw me skidding around muddy trails in my local woods like some baggies-wearing teenager. It’s the kind of thing that geriatric me would bemoan as being another nail in the coffin of traditional road riding values – it’s all been going to the dogs since road bikes got disc brakes, don’t you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which am I? The whisky-sipping old fart who reminisces about steel frames, 19mm tyres and appreciates a drink that comes with tasting notes, or the born-again renegade sticking two fingers up to tradition and considering getting a leg tattoo?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect the truth is that I’m both these things, and neither. I’m simply responding to a road cycling landscape that is in a state of flux as manufacturers expand the remit and capabilities of their bikes, and a new generation of riders emerges with new views about what the sport should be about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As YT’s product development manager, Frank Dörr, says when explaining the thinking behind the Szepter, ‘We just want to bring together different kinds of people, different genres.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youth and oldies getting along? Roadies and off-roadies living in harmony? A cycling world free of tribes? It’s a crazy idea, but it might just work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pete Muir</strong> Editor</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Lillie and Alain Rumpf</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 139?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Switzerland’s gift to the Giro:</strong> In May, the Giro d’Italia will cross the border to visit the Croix de Coeur in Switzerland.
