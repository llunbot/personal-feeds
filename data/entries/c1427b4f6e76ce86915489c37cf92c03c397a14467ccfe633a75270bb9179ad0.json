For example, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FUWA3ZM/A/refurbished-apple-pencil-usb-c\">pricing is set at £69 in the UK</a>, down from £79 brand new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOriginally released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on/\">in November 2023</a>, the lower-cost Apple Pencil has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2 and Apple Pencil Pro, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing with a USB-C cable. It attaches magnetically to any iPad with a USB-C port, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing. It also lacks pressure sensitivity and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says its refurbished products undergo full functionality testing, and are subject to a thorough cleaning process and inspection. The refurbished Apple Pencils are repackaged in a plainer white box with a refurbished label.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAvailability of the refurbished USB-C Apple Pencil will likely extend to the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries within the next few weeks.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil With USB-C Now Available in Apple's Refurbished Store in These Countries</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-with-usb-c-now-available-in-apples-refurbished-store-in-these-countries.2430896/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c1427b4f6e76ce86915489c37cf92c03c397a14467ccfe633a75270bb9179ad0","category":"Apple"}
