At the time, it had lots of bugs, long shipping delays, and some uncertainty about how much commitment its maker, Valve, really had for its latest hardware experiment. I gave in and bought one about two months ago, and I've been enjoying this much-improved device ever since.</p>\n<p>But now comes the Asus ROG Ally, which is powered by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/amds-ryzen-z1-chips-could-power-a-new-wave-of-handheld-steam-deck-clones/\">a new 55 percent faster AMD Ryzen Z1 chip</a> yet costs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23700094/asus-rog-ally-price-amd-z1-extreme\">only $50 more</a> than the highest-end Steam Deck at a purported (store-leaked) $700. It also runs Windows 11 (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/handheld-mode-for-windows-could-make-it-work-better-on-steam-deck-style-pcs/\">perhaps in \"handheld\" mode</a>), making it easier to run many games, including blockbuster AAA titles and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/\">massive online titles like <em>Fortnite</em></a>. The Ally is seemingly a bit flatter and lighter than the Steam Deck, and it has a sharper and brighter screen and a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz. It might even run cooler and quieter, according to brief hands-on experiences <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23695254/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview\">posted by reporters</a>. It will seemingly arrive in early May or shortly thereafter.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asus_rog_ally_stats.jpg\"><img alt=\"Nearly every one of these specs shows a notable improvement over the Steam Deck, and yet I, a new Deck owner, remain sanguine.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asus_rog_ally_stats-640x496.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asus_rog_ally_stats-1280x991.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asus_rog_ally_stats.jpg\">Nearly every one of these specs shows a notable improvement over the Steam Deck, and yet I, a new Deck owner, remain sanguine.</a> </p></div>\n<p>As you might expect, the gaming press—which, like all press, is fundamentally geared toward conflict—is cheering to see another combatant enter the arena.
