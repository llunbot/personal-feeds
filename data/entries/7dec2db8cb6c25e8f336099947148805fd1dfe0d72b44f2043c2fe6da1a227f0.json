The company entered into a $68.7 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard in January 2022, but the CMA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-blocked/\">blocked</a> it over concerns it would be anticompetitive in the cloud gaming market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicrosoft was unable to finalize the deal globally until approval was granted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicrosoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was approved by regulators in several other regions and territories including Brazil, Chile, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Africa, and most recently, the European Union.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nActivision is one of the most popular video games publishers in the world, and the deal represents one of the biggest shake-ups in the games industry in recent history. The studio is the maker of hit titles such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicrosoft hopes the takeover will boost demand for its Xbox console and allow it to add more titles to its Xbox Game Pass streaming service, where members pay a subscription fee to access a catalog of titles via the cloud.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nXbox Game Pass is available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> through Safari, but not the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. While Apple does allow all-in-one gaming subscription services to be on the platform, every game offered on the service must be submitted individually for approval through the ‌‌App Store‌‌ review process.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-to-buy-activision-blizzard/\">Microsoft's $69 Billion Deal to Buy Activision Blizzard Cleared By UK</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsofts-69-billion-deal-to-buy-activision-blizzard-cleared-by-uk.2407413/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7dec2db8cb6c25e8f336099947148805fd1dfe0d72b44f2043c2fe6da1a227f0","category":"Apple"}
