As are its accessories. So if you want one, you’re probably waiting for the best possible deal to jump at. Well, this is that deal: Ahead of Black Friday, Amazon is slashing up to $300 off the iPad Pro and its accessories ahead of Black Friday, and you can put together a super bundle for hundreds off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best possible bundle is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J89FYD/\" target=\"_blank\">11-inch iPad Pro with 2TB of storage</a> ($300 off) with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Pencil Pro</a> ($30 off; <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-pencil-pro-white/6535042.p?skuId=6535042\" target=\"_blank\">also at Best Buy</a>) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Experience-Trackpad-Function/dp/B0D3J65R9N\" target=\"_blank\">11-inch Magic Keyboard</a> ($50 off) for a combined savings of $380. But we also like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J82K45/\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch iPad Pro with 1TB of storage</a> ($200 off) with the Apple Pencil Pro and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J5ZBFR\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch Magic Keyboard</a> ($75 off) for more than $300 off. Remember, you’re also getting twice as much RAM with the 1TB and 2TB models, a full 16GB versus 8GB on the other configurations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also find savings on models with less storage. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC\" target=\"_blank\">11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage</a> is $150 off, while the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75/\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch model with 256GB of storage</a> is $200 off. Add in the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard savings, and you’re still looking at a fantastic deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 iPad Pro is Apple’s top-of-the-line tablet, with a new thinner design (the 13-inch model is just 5.3mm) and a repositioned front camera that’s now on the longer landscape edge. It also now has an OLED display for richer colors and deeper blacks. And it’s fully compatible with Apple Intelligence as it rolls out over the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Pro is without a doubt the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2414833/the-m4-ipad-pro-is-impossible.html\">best tablet Apple or anyone else has ever made</a>. And at these prices, it’s a pretty good bargain too.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"19cd567d1db38c5de6a2f5bad0602342e85a2d6bc30ae87e082cbe9b35b0db8b","category":"Apple"}
