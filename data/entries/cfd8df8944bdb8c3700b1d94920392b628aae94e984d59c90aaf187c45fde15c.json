{"title":"Sauronâ€™s dark rise is front and center in The Rings of Power S2 teaser","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024317","date":1715724596000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>Charlie Vicker's Sauron is front and center in the teaser for S2 of <em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em>. </p></div>\n<p>Amazon's Prime Video made a major investment in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power\"><em>The Rings of Power</em></a> when it acquired the rights to the source material from the Tolkien estate, even committing to multiple seasons upfront. The casting was strong and the visuals were quite spectacular (including the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/this-youtube-star-re-created-rings-of-power-title-sequence-in-chladni-figures/\">opening credits</a>). But while the first season had its moments, personally I found it a bit plodding, often more concerned with establishing this rich fictional world and the characters within it than moving the story forward.</p>\n<p>Showrunners J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/10-burning-questions-about-amazons-the-rings-of-power\">have said</a> that this was deliberate. They wanted to avoid a \"villain-centric\" story in S1 but promised they would be delving more deeply into \"the lore and the stories people have been waiting to hear.\" That would be the rise of Sauron (Charlie Vickers), the forging of the titular rings of power, and the last alliance between elves and men to defeat Sauron's evil machinations. Judging by the teaser that dropped today, we'll be getting lots more action in S2, with the shape-shifting Sauron now handily disguised as an elf. Bonus: There's an accompanying behind-the-scenes preview of the second season.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the S1 finale below.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024317#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024317&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cfd8df8944bdb8c3700b1d94920392b628aae94e984d59c90aaf187c45fde15c","category":"Tech"}
