{"title":"X Rolls Out New ‘Chumbox’ Ad Format — Post-Like Things That Can’t Be Reported or Blocked","link":"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-x-new-clickbait-ad-format","date":1696638791000,"content":"\n<p>Matt Binder, reporting for Mashable:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mashable has confirmed this ad format with numerous users from \nacross X and have seen a variety of different ads running this \nbizarre new format that just consists of written copy text, a \nphoto, and a fake avatar that’s sole purpose is to make the ad \nlook like an organically posted tweet. </p>\n\n<p>The type of content being promoted in the ads that Mashable has \nviewed appear to be consistent with ads found in spammy, low \nquality “<a href=\"https://www.theawl.com/2015/06/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum/\"><em>chumbox</em></a>” advertising — typically defined as \nthose clickbait ads found at the bottom of posts on content farm \nsites — made popular by native ad networks like <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fake-news-outbrain-taboola-hillary-clinton\"><em>Taboola</em></a>. </p>\n\n<p>“This Seems Unbelievable, But Happens in Dubai Everyday” reads one \nad that takes users to a third-party content mill website, \noverloaded with ads of its own. “These Incredibly Cool Gadgets \nThat Are Going To Sell Out This Year. Action Now!” and “If you \nsuffer from ringing ears (Tinnitus) you’re going to love this \nrecent breakthrough” are other examples of some of the content \nfound in these X ads. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yaccarino <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/29/yaccarino-boorstin\">keeps</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/x-ceo-yaccarino-tells-bank-lenders-that-revenue-grew-by-single-digit-percentage-2023-10-05/\">claiming</a> that X is on the upswing, but looking at the actual content — especially the ads — says otherwise. These new “chumbox” ads are bottom-of-the-barrel stuff, the sort of ads I’d expect to see on a third-rate Twitter knock-off site like Truth Social. X itself now feels like a third-rate Twitter knock-off.</p>\n\n<p>I fully expect them to continue scraping right through the bottom of the barrel and go even lower.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/x-chumbox\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4d4c71b07510e2dd2dcd180c87a6ace0e6ab3ae12f61d316727cc7969b2890b6","category":"Tech"}
