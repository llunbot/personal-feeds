They may have ended up setting US legal precedent.</p>\n<p>After a trial in federal court in Seattle last week, a jury found cheat-seller AimJunkies, along with its parent company Phoenix Digital and four of its employees and contractors, liable for copyright infringement and assigned damages to each of them. The jury split $63,210 in damages, with $20,000 to Phoenix Digital itself and just under $11,000 each to the four individuals. That's just under the $65,000 revenue the defendants claimed to have generated from 1,400 copies of its <em>Destiny 2</em> cheats.</p>\n<p>Bungie's case appears to have gone <a href=\"https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungie-aimjunkies-destiny-2-trial\">further than any other game-cheating suit</a> has made it in the US court system. Because cheating at an online game is not, in itself, illegal, game firms typically lean on the anti-circumvention aspects of the 1998 Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA). That's how the makers of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/gta-online-cheat-tool-maker-ordered-to-pay-150000/\"><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/blizzard-ups-the-ante-against-overwatch-cheats-by-filing-lawsuit/\"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/rainbow-six-cheat-maker-faces-ubisoft-lawsuit-after-bbc-appearance/\"><em>Rainbow Six</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/fortnite-gta-v-hackers-face-legal-action-for-online-cheating/\"><em>Fortnite</em></a> have pursued their cheat-making antagonists. Bungie, in taking their claim past settlement and then winning a copyright claim from a jury, has perhaps provided game makers a case to point to in future proceedings, and perhaps more incentive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027163#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027163&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"28fe80f89dadc5f4c7ac6e8b37e8716e7585f34ec0f9109bf1595ea9baff5001","category":"Tech"}
