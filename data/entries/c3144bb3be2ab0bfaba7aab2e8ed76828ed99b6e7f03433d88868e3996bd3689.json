With 55Nm of torque and 600W of peak power, we’re sure this motor can go toe-to-toe with Fazua’s Ride 60, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/specialized-s-works-turbo-levo-sl-ii-review/\">Specialized’s Levo SL 1.2</a> unit and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/trek-fuel-exe-9-9-xx1-axs-first-ride-review/\">Trek’s TQ</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Arguably, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinion-e-drive-gearbox/\">Pinion’s E-Drive MGU</a> all-in-one motor and gearbox is more innovative. Removing the need for a traditional external drivetrain, the ex-Porsche engineers have combined drive and gearing into one, rather compact unit.</p>\n<p>Boasting a whopping 600 per cent gear range, up to 160Nm of torque and 600W of peak power, the MGU weighs around 4kg all in, which is lighter than most other drive units, with a drivetrain combined.</p>\n<p>If <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a> aren’t you thing, we’ve also seen plenty of non-assisted tech this week.</p>\n<p>Two new lightweight XC tyres have launched; the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/mountain-bike-tyres/hutchinson-wyrm-racing-lab-tyre-review/\">Hutchinson Wyrm Racing Lab</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/goodyear-peak-sl/\">Goodyear Peak SL</a>, both designed for the speed of cross-country and marathon racing.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re feeling as energetic as Jonas Vingegaard <em>et al</em>, then <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/oakley-2023-tour-de-france-collection/\">Oakley’s bright yellow Tour de France</a> limited-edition glasses might be right up your street.</p>\n<p>Orbea’s house-brand <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/orbea-oquo-wheelsets/\">Oquo has announced eight road- and gravel-specific wheelsets</a> made from both carbon and aluminium. Although Orbea riders will probably love these, the discreet styling means riders from any bike brand can run them without clashing.</p>\n<p>And finally, after Raleigh blew up the internet by announcing the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-raleigh-chopper/\">return of the Chopper</a> at the end of May, we’ve taken a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/raleigh-chopper-1970s-icon/\">deeper dive into the history of the model</a> and what makes it such an icon.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, below are some of the best bits of kit to cross BikeRadar’s virtual desks this week.</p>\n<h2>DT Swiss FR 1500 Classic</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 Classic mountain bike wheels\" title=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 mountain bike wheels-3\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Our set of 29in wheels weighed 2,079g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Synonymous with quality, the all-new FR 1500 Classic wheelset from Swiss-based wheel-building experts DT is made using the brand’s venerable 240 Classic hubs and the burly, range-topping aluminium FR 541 rims.</p>\n<p>The new rim profile, DT claims, means the wheels are lighter than before, while improving on the previous model’s impact and pinch-flat resistance.</p>\n<p>Joined using welding, the aluminium rims are said to be the most resistant in DT’s portfolio.</p>\n<p>They’re laced to 240 hubs using the brand’s Competition spokes.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/DT-Swiss-FR-1500-mountain-bike-wheels-5-b1e54d1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 Classic mountain bike wheels\" title=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 mountain bike wheels-5\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>DT Swiss is synonymous with quality.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/DT-Swiss-FR-1500-mountain-bike-wheels-7-335ac4e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 Classic mountain bike wheels\" title=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 mountain bike wheels-7\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>DT’s top-spec 240 hubs are fitted.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/DT-Swiss-FR-1500-mountain-bike-wheels-6-513b841.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 Classic mountain bike wheels\" title=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 mountain bike wheels-6\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The FR 1500 Classic wheels use the FR 541 rims.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/DT-Swiss-FR-1500-mountain-bike-wheels-9-d78eeb9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 Classic mountain bike wheels\" title=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 mountain bike wheels-9\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The front wheel uses 28 spokes, the rear 32.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/DT-Swiss-FR-1500-mountain-bike-wheels-13-1d2d9dc.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 Classic mountain bike wheels\" title=\"DT Swiss FR 1500 mountain bike wheels-13\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>FR 541’s rim profile is designed to be strong, light and reduce pinch flats.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In a further drive to lose weight, the front wheel has 28 spokes (compared to 32 on the previous model), while the rear has 32 for more strength.</p>\n<p>Onto the 240 hub.

that’s often overlooked is the conundrum of finding a bottle to fit within the confines of smaller-sized full-suspension bike frames.</p>\n<p>Usually, bike manufacturers will fit bottle mount bosses to their XS and S bikes, but not leave space for a decent bottle without it hitting the rear shock, top tube or both.</p>\n<p>Conventional cages and bottles – even smaller ones – usually sit too proud and are too square to fit.</p>\n<p>Some brands, such as YT, have made their own bespoke bottles (YT’s is dubbed the Thirstmaster 6000) to fit with a specific frame’s design.</p>\n<p>Fidlock’s Twist
