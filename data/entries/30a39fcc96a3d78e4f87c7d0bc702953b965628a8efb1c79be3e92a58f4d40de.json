Biden's executive order has clarified that following this comment period, the Copyright Office will publish the results of its study. And then, within 180 days of that publication—or within 270 days of Biden's order, \"whichever comes later\"—the Copyright Office's director will consult with Biden to \"issue recommendations to the President on potential executive actions relating to copyright and AI.\"</p>\n<p>\"The recommendations shall address any copyright and related issues discussed in the United States Copyright Office’s study, including the scope of protection for works produced using AI and the treatment of copyrighted works in AI training,\" Biden's order said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981015#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981015&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30a39fcc96a3d78e4f87c7d0bc702953b965628a8efb1c79be3e92a58f4d40de","category":"Tech"}
