OneUp says the new pedals are light enough for cross country but beefy and durable enough for downhill.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal First pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-First-pic-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / OneUp Components)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new pedals are also “super light” (410g with pins), and sport a “large DH-sized platform”. They’re SPD-compatible and available in 8 colors. OneUp says that with the ultra-thin, 26.8mm profile, they are “the thinnest mountain bike clip pedals in the world”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Do Clipless Pedals Have Clips?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you may have noticed that OneUp is calling pedals that would typically be called ‘clipless’ simply their ‘clip’ pedals. If you’ve always been confused about why so-called clipless pedals have clips, the answer dates back to the time of the toe clip – those metal or plastic cages that wrapped around the front of your shoe and were often secured with a toe strap. As pedal manufacturers added mechanical locking attachments with cleats and moved away from the toe clips, they took to calling the new pedals ‘clipless’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to the present, and the clipless moniker has lost much of its meaning. So it seems that OneUp are diving in with the logical conclusion: clip pedals. These ‘clip’ pedals don’t function any differently than ‘clipless’ pedals though. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding a really thin pedal could help decrease the chance of pedal strikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing the Clip Pedals, OneUp was shooting to combine the confidence-inspiring feel that flat pedals give you with the efficiency and performance of clips. Many clip pedal platforms often don’t touch your shoe while clipped in. With OneUp’s new pedals, the large platform is designed to actively support your shoe. The four hollow, removable pins let the rider further adjust the pedal’s grip and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal cleats\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cleats-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal adjustment\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-adjustment-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OneUp’s new pedals use the proven and reliable SPD system, which is arguably the world’s most popular cleat standard. With the Clip Pedals custom binding system, there is no front/back or up/down movement. This system is said to give the user a tighter cleat fit without sacrificing float or ease of release. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal cornering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-cornering-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneUp SPD mechanism provides the rider with 5 degrees of float as well as 12 degrees of release angle. And they say there is no unwanted play between the cleat and binding. They are also said to offer a wider range of spring tension than the Shimano versions. While there is no word on whether the cleats are cross-compatible with Shimano SPDs, the shape looks very close. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strong Enough for DH!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new OneUp Clip Pedals have “DH-rated” spindles that will be strong enough for all riding styles. They are equipped with sealed cartridge bearings that are said to be long-lasting and replaceable. These pedals are in stock and ready to ship. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal top side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-top-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retail &amp; Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $159</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>410g with pins (4 pins per side)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Thickness: </strong>14.4mm (body), 26.8mm (binding)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Size: </strong>80mm x 90mm (W x L)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stance width: </strong>57.5mm (center of clip to outside of crank face)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Float: </strong>5° (12° release angle)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cleats: </strong>OneUp Cleats (SPD Compatible and includes 1mm cleat spacers for shoe fit tuning) <strong>Bearing configuration: </strong>Inboard igusTM Bushing and 3x outboard sealed cartridge bearings <strong>Axle: </strong>Chromoly Steel with Black ED coating</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pins: </strong>Hollow M5x8mm threaded pins (self-cleaning hex through hole)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Colors: </strong>Black, Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Purple, Grey, Bronze</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"OneUp Components Clip Pedal pedaling\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OneUp-Components-Clip-Pedal-pedaling-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.oneupcomponents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OneUpCompnents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/oneup-components-new-do-it-all-clip-pedals/\">OneUp Component’s New Do-It-All Clip Pedals</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"63011e6a256be0dd1937b838c31449f21942d36041ff4f1797b45f179d910b68","category":"Cycling"}
