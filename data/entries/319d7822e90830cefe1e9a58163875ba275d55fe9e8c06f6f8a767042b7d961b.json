Cube is a family business, and that approach extends to the Intermarché-Circus-Wanty WorldTour team and Tormans Cyclo Cross Team it supplies bikes to, which in turn have a major influence on the development of the brand’s bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of this symbiotic relationship is Cube’s in-house innovation centre and test lab at its headquarters in Waldershof, Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our company stands for innovative technical solutions and creative implementation,’ says Harald Lucas, product manager at Cube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Cube Innovation Centre (CIC) epitomises this hugely important aspect of our company culture. The CIC is the creative heart and soul of our bikes, and the source of all our ground-breaking innovations, from the original idea all the way through to implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Every product goes through rigorous testing in our in-house test lab. The requirements we set for the safety and function of our products are well above standard thresholds. Products that pass this hurdle are then put through their paces in the real world by our engineers and team riders. The result is an uncompromising combination of outstanding function, low weight, optimal stiffness and maximum safety.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pro level ready</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cube and Intermarché have been partners since 2015, and this long-standing relationship has helped Cube further develop its portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We are immensely proud to work closely with a UCI WorldTeam and be part of such an incredible evolution over the last few years,’ says Lucas.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cube advertorial\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Cube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘For the Litening Aero we used our well-established Aerium C:68 as a basis – backed up with wind-tunnel testing at every stage of the design and production process. With the Litening Air, meanwhile, we took our UCI-compliant aero design experience and put it on a diet. Now we have two race-winning bikes for Intermarché-Circus-Wanty.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Litening Aero C:68X is a lightweight carbon aero bike made to deliver speed and the ultimate competitive advantage. It is the bike that Eritrean Biniam Girmay of Intermarché rode to a historic win at Gent-Wevelgem in 2022, when he became the first African to win a major Classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also the bike he rode when he won stage 10 of the Giro d’Italia – the first Eritrean and Black rider to win a Grand Tour stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Litening speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Litening Air C:68X is also ridden by Intermarché, and Cube’s direct relationship with the team has played a key role in the development of such a fast and slippery bike. ‘The riders provide us with invaluable feedback that flows directly into our development process, benefiting both us and our road and time-trial bikes,’ says Lucas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Litening Air C:68X series is the result of this collaboration. Fans may have already spotted the team riding a prototype at the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2021 before we launched in August 2022. The prototype has also been in use at multiple one-day Classics as well as stage races throughout 2021 and 2022.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cube advertorial\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Cube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Our designers set out with a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve: a pure-bred racer that’s extremely light and aerodynamic, yet comfortable on long days out in the saddle. This bike is the perfect marriage of low weight and aerodynamic design.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mid-size frame comes in at around 799g, svelte enough to easily target the UCI minimum of 6.8kg for a complete build.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comfortable endurance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Cube clearly excels in offering next-level road racing models, the brand also boasts a range of endurance bikes such as the Cube Agree, which combines racy geometry, relaxed handling and overall bike position but is still nimble and responsive when climbing. It’s a jack-of-all-trades, able to take on sportives, club rides, commuting and more. The top-end Agree C:62 Pro 2022 delivers confidence-inspiring handling backed up by the efficiency of Sram’s latest AXS groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the Cube Attain, which offers the most relaxed road geometry in the range and is the brand’s answer to an all-day grand tourer. The Attain GTC SL build offers a lively ride and a finishing kit level that outdoes rivals. Cube also offers a women’s-specific version, the Axial, which is designed around smaller frame sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adventure awaits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel bike, tourer, commuter? The Cube Nuroad can be all three, bringing together all Cube’s expertise to take your ride off the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When we set out to develop a new bike we always have our experience in building great bikes in mind,’ says Lucas. ‘For example, the Nuroad’s geometry is based on the comfort, stability and agility of our road race bikes combined with cyclocross ruggedness. It’s the perfect tool for pushing the boundaries and exploring further off the beaten track – without compromising on speed.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cube advertorial\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Cube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Nuroad benefits from a serious selection of mounts too – front and rear mudguard mounts, rear rack and lowrider on the fork, mounts for a chainstay-mounted kickstand – making it a great choice for any bikepacking adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The range has tyre clearance up to 45mm, more than enough for ripping up gnarly gravel, and the Nuroad is available in both carbon and aluminium at prices designed to offer great value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nuroad C:62 is the full carbon option and comes in several configurations including the SL, which boasts a Sram AXS 1×12 groupset and hydraulic disc brakes for just £3,599. Over on the aluminium side it’s a similar story – great specs for attractive prices. For example, the Nuroad Race has a super-light aluminium frame and carbon fork and comes specced with Shimano GRX, all for £1,799.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Relentless passion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cube’s passion for bikes isn’t just about delivering performance at great value either. Its extensive range of bikes of all shapes and sizes is aimed at getting the whole family moving.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cube advertorial\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cube-advertorial-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Cube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘There’s a Cube for everyone: road bike, MTB, kids, and also a big focus on urban mobility: e-bikes, touring/trekking bikes, cargo bikes and more to come,’ explains Lucas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We love bikes, it’s as simple as that, from the carbon soles of our shoes to the beads of sweat on our brows as we sprint for the next town sign. That’s why we build bikes that live up to our expectations and get our hearts beating, that we ourselves love to ride. Every bike in our range is the culmination of our passion and know-how.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the top three bike brands in the world by volume, Cube is equally conscious of its wider impact and ensuring its bikes last the test of time. Cube aims for its bikes to have a lifespan of over 20 years through a combination of rigorous testing, the supplied warranty and its crash replacement scheme. It is also committed to sustainable innovation such as manufacturing mudguards and bottle cages from recycled plastic, and is constantly adapting its products, manufacturing methods and location to reduce its environmental impact where possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cube bikes are available in more than 225 bike shops across the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• Visit <a href=\"https://www.cube.eu/uk-en/\" target=\"_blank\">cube.eu</a> to discover the whole Cube range and search for a dealer nearby</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cube-the-ultimate-ride\">Cube: The ultimate ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"319d7822e90830cefe1e9a58163875ba275d55fe9e8c06f6f8a767042b7d961b","category":"Cycling"}
