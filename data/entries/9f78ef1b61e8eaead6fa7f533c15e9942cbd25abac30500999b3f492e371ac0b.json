And it’s going to be a big year—along with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629813/apple-folding-iphone-design-display-specs-release.html\">folding phone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2550737/report-the-oled-macbook-pro-will-dump-the-notch-for-a-camera-hole.html\">OLED MacBooks,</a> Apple is also planning to launch a brand new wearable powered by Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has big plans to release smart glasses in the second half of 2026, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/apple-plans-glasses-for-2026-as-part-of-ai-push-nixes-watch-with-camera\">new report</a> by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The glasses will be similar to the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2524108/meta-ai-avoid-at-all-costs-or-genuine-game-changer.html\">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> that have a built-in camera for taking pictures, shooting video, and analyzing images, open-ear speakers, and a microphone for voice commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman states that the glasses will be similar to the Ray-Ban Metas but “better made.” It will also be able to “handle tasks such as phone calls, music playback, live translations, and turn-by-turn directions.” He also said that “large quantities of prototypes” will be ready by the end of this year. Eventually, the glasses would support augmented reality, where digital content is superimposed on what the user sees, but those features are “years away.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report comes a day after OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/openai-to-buy-ai-device-startup-from-apple-veteran-jony-ive-in-65-billion-deal/ar-AA1FdBVV\">announced</a> a major deal to acquire an AI startup company established by Jony Ive, Apple’s former design chief, who is currently running design firm LoveFrom. The deal was struck <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/what-sam-altman-told-openai-about-the-secret-device-hes-making-with-jony-ive-f1384005\">to deliver Open AI-based products</a>, which would compete with Apple. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2790350/after-google-ios-big-ai-reveals-my-iphone-has-never-felt-dumber.html\">Google also announced plans</a> to deliver Gemini-based smart glasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Gurman reports that while Apple’s smart glasses will rely on AI-based features, people within Apple expressed concern that the company’s mishandling of AI development will hinder the ability to develop the product. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2561596/where-is-apple-intelligence-on-my-iphone.html\">Visual Intelligence</a>, introduced with iOS 18.2, can provide information based on a visual examination of what is seen through an iPhone camera, but it relies heavily on ChatGPT. Apple will want to be able to use its own AI technology instead for the smart glasses, so a revamped Siri needs to come first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also reported that Apple has scrapped plans to equip the Apple Watch with cameras. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646745/the-apple-watch-may-get-a-new-life-as-a-camera-equipped-ai-device.html\">plan</a> was to use the camera for AI-based features. Apple is reportedly continuing with the development of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382012/airpods-rumor-infrared-camera-module-vision-pro-2026.html\">camera-equipped AirPods</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9f78ef1b61e8eaead6fa7f533c15e9942cbd25abac30500999b3f492e371ac0b","category":"Apple"}
