There were the usual big brands, plus some upstarts and updates with killer new ideas and products worth a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above, Kuat introduced their Ibex overland collection for pickup trucks, with a telescoping design and multiple frames to fit different trucks from Toyota, Dodge/RAM, Ford, Chevy/GMC, Nissan, and more. It’s designed as a shell, with plenty of accessories to customize it however you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02.jpg\" alt=\"kuat overland truck bed rigging and piston hitch rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuat-overland-truck-bed-rigging-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross bars fit any of their roof trays, holding bikes, skis, snowboards, etc., and MOLLE-style side panels can be added to fit other gear on the inside and outside.

Then just pop the ramp off and throw it in your trunk. If you have e-bikes and routinely carry more than 2 bikes, this makes it much, much easier to get those first bikes on versus trying to maneuver the bike and yourself around a 3-4 bike rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Railias</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02.jpg\" alt=\"railias truck bed fork mounts and bike stand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Upstart <a href=\"https://www.railias.com\" target=\"_blank\">Railias</a> has a unique take on the truck tailgate pad. You can use it like normal, with soft, shaped cradles cuddling your downtube as it rests on the tailgate. Or, use their strap in mounts to attach fork mounts, a shade tent, or a repair stand:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03.jpg\" alt=\"railias truck bed fork mounts and bike stand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The repair stand clamp telescopes, and can pop in and out of the mounting tray easily, so you can secure it inside the vehicle when you’re out riding, but make easy repairs when necessary. Note the small storage pockets integrated into the padding, too…great for keeping brake pad spacers on hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01.jpg\" alt=\"railias truck bed fork mounts and bike stand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/railias-truck-bed-bike-rack-accessories-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The design is more clever than it looks. Without the repair stand there, you can position the fork’s axle higher up on the tailgate (or not), and then just close the tailgate and it rolls your bike backward into the bed. So, you don’t have to drive with the tailgate open if you’re storing other stuff in the bed, too. Other accessories let you mount base plates to a wall or van floor, too, so you can use the same fork mounts and accessories elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inno Racks</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07.jpg\" alt=\"inno racks cargo box that fits on hitch racks and roof racks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/inno-racks-adjustable-hitch-rack-platform-07-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.innoracks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Inno Racks</a> has a new base rack system coming, using a modular approach that makes it really easy to move and remove bike trays, letting you position them to more easily nest two bikes together.
