Thanks in part to customer demand, Yeti Cycles has just announced that they will be selling bikes directly to the consumer. The option has been added to the website along with options to purchase from an authorized Yeti dealer, or through one of their online partners. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most brands we’ve seen make this transition, Yeti expresses their commitment to supporting their independent dealers, stating,”bike shops are critical in building local communities, supporting youth engagement, advocating for local trail access, and keeping bikes running smoothly, and Yeti will continue to support dealers in strategic ways.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list-800x415.png\" alt=\"Yeti Locally tool\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list-800x415.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list-297x154.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list-120x62.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list-768x398.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list-1536x797.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Locally-bike-shop-inventory-list-2048x1062.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those ways is the introduction of ‘Locally’ on the Yeti site. When checking out for a bike or accessory, the Locally widget will tell you if any shop within 300 miles has that exact product in stock. If not, you can still open up the map to expand the search to see if you can find it at another store before purchasing online. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, it seems most shops do not have a searchable inventory on the Locally. Those that do, allow you to browse their entire stock, down to sizes and colors. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Building Yeti bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-62-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"packing yeti bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti_Spring22_Lifestyle-60-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large-800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"packing yeti bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large-800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large-400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large-1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/230628_YETI_LifeStyle-2896-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photos/Yeti)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can’t find the right bike locally, or would prefer to just purchase directly, Yeti is hoping to make the process as easy as possible. All bikes are built-to-order at their Colorado HQ, and delivered ready to ride – meaning the brakes will be bedded-in, tubeless sealant added, and even suspension settings will be dialed for the customer. Yeti also states that the final assembly by the customer involves simply installing the front wheel and handlebar using “high-quality tools provided with the bike.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://yeticycles.com\">yeticycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/how-to-buy-yeti-bike-direct-or-locally/\">Yeti Cycles Goes Direct, Adds Web Tools to Shop Locally</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"47850e94f58c508a276e6b16ced550bd19ce0db2a780dd411f5f6215304b81a6","category":"Cycling"}
