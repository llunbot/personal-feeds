The panel — speaking from their experience both developing the upstream standard and actually implementing the APIs with different vendors, will address how they fit into the larger ecosystem of service discovery solutions, including service meshes and vendor-specific tooling.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://more.suse.com/RancherKubeConEU22.html\">Accelerate Zero Trust Security with HashiCorp and Rancher</a></h3>\n\n<p>Wednesday April 19 @ 12:45 CEST / Rancher by SUSE Booth</p>\n\n<p>This SUSE/Rancher and HashiCorp partner session is ed by HashiCorp Senior Solutions Engineer Cojan van Ballegooijen. Zero trust security is predicated on securing everything based on trusted identities. With HashiCorp’s model around zero trust security, organizations can manage their transition to the cloud while maintaining the level of security they need, one that trusts nothing and authenticates and authorizes everything. This session will address how to scale HashiCorp’s zero trust security solutions across Kubernetes deployments running on SUSE Rancher.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://register.paloaltonetworks.com/devsecparty\">Cloud Native DevSec Party</a></h3>\n\n<p>Wednesday April 19 @ 20:00 CEST / <a href=\"https://www.fabrique-lumieres.com/en/home\">Fabrique des Lumières</a></p>\n\n<p>The Prisma Cloud and HashiCorp teams are hosting a KubeCon afterparty with cocktails, appetizers, an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auUjU63r35Q\">audiovisual show</a>, Salvador Dalí's art, and DJ Nicky.

Check out these resources for insights and background on the hottest topics at KubeCon: </p>\n\n<h3>Securing Kubernetes with HashiCorp tools</h3>\n\n<p>Manually securing Kubernetes can leave your organization vulnerable. Fortunately, many of these challenges can be addressed using a zero trust security strategy. HashiCorp’s zero trust security approach addresses Kubernetes security challenges by introducing automated workflows that dynamically generate, store, encrypt, and rotate secrets; securely connect services between Kubernetes clusters and non-Kubernetes clusters; and help ensure user access is consistent and secure. To learn more, watch HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar explain how to solve common Kubernetes security challenges in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGMtZQZk-2c\">whiteboard video</a>:</p>\n<h3>Using HashiCorp Vault with Kubernetes</h3>\n\n<p>HashiCorp Vault allows applications and users to securely and elegantly store and retrieve secrets. By integrating with Kubernetes, Vault can expose this functionality to applications that run on top of Kubernetes pods as well as let existing Vault systems interface with Kubernetes infrastructure. Using the new Vault Secrets Operator to get secrets directly from Kubernetes helps operators, practitioners, and security administrators work faster and more securely, while supporting standard Terraform Cloud workflows, permissions, and more. To learn more, read Rich DuBose and Tom Chwojko-Frank’s blog post on the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-secrets-operator-a-new-method-for-kubernetes-integration\">Vault Secrets Operator: A new method for Kubernetes integration</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Connecting to Kubernetes Clusters with HashiCorp Boundary</h3>\n\n<p>HashiCorp Boundary is a tool for managing access to modern, dynamic infrastructure based on identity. In conjunction with Boundary, users can leverage Vault to auto-generate short-lived credentials just-in-time, so remote users don’t have to store permanent Kubernetes tokens on their local machines. To learn more, read Van Phan and Ravi Panchal’s blog post on <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/how-to-connect-to-kubernetes-clusters-using-boundary\">How to Connect to Kubernetes Clusters Using Boundary</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Zero trust security in Kubernetes via HashiCorp Consul service mesh</h3>\n\n<p>A service mesh like HashiCorp Consul can be an essential part of applying zero trust security principles to modern, complex, Kubernetes deployments. And that’s only one of the many things that Consul can do. To learn more, read Ashher Syed’s blog post <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/zero-trust-security-for-kubernetes-with-a-service-mesh\">Zero trust security for Kubernetes with a service mesh</a> and discover <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/3-surprising-things-consul-service-mesh-can-do\">3 Surprising things Consul service mesh can do</a>, by Ashher Syed and Van Phan.</p>\n\n<h3>Explore the Terraform Cloud Operator for Kubernetes</h3>\n\n<p>The Terraform Cloud Operator for Kubernetes allows lifecycle management of cloud and on-premises infrastructure through a single Kubernetes custom resource. The operator uses a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) to manage Terraform Cloud workspaces. These workspaces execute a Terraform run to provision resources while leveraging Terraform Cloud for proper state handling and locking, sequential execution of runs, and established patterns for injecting secrets and provisioning resources. To learn more about the Terraform Cloud Operator for Kubernetes, now in public beta, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're attending KubeCon Europe 2023 in person or remotely, we’re sure you’ll have a rewarding experience, and we look forward to answering your questions and helping you get the most out of the event.</p>\n","author":"Jenny Evans","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"8d3e6603b6a1f9c55d071b91b20245b71746a9c37676fd6ee5e6b296b1036df3","category":"Tech"}
