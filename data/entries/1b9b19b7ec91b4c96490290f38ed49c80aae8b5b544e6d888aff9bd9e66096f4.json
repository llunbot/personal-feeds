We know you have them, so make yours come to life. Don't simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app's name or UI and pass it off as your own. In addition to risking an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App Store harder to navigate and just isn't fair to your fellow developers.</blockquote>\r<br />\nPartiful is designed to allow users to send customized event invitations with just a few steps, and it has a feature set that is similar to Apple's new Invites app. Partiful still has options that set it apart from Invites, such as better cross-platform functionality. Unlike Invites, Partiful does not require event attendees to enter an email address to confirm their event attendance, and invitations can be created through an app or from the web.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple lets invitations be sent to non-Apple users, but an email address is required. Creating an invite is tied to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>+ subscription, so it is not free for anyone to use like Partiful.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen Apple creates an app or a feature that has functionality found in a third-party app, it is referred to as sherlocking. The name dates back to a \"Sherlock\" search tool in OS X that Apple enhanced with features that were cribbed from a third-party app called Watson. Watson's developers accused Apple of copying the product without compensation, and from then on, sherlocking has been used to describe apps that are supplanted by Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are similarities between Partiful and Invites, but event-focused apps and websites are a popular category and there are services that pre-date Partiful too, like Evite. Checking the ‌App Store‌ shows no shortage of popular event planning apps, including Paperless, Invitation Maker, and Punchbowl, in addition to Evite and Partiful, so there is no clear indication that Apple set out to copy Partiful or any app in particular.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-invites/\">Apple Invites</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/partiful-apple-invites-app-copycat/\">Partiful Calls Apple a Copycat for New Invites App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/partiful-calls-apple-a-copycat-for-new-invites-app.2448774/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1b9b19b7ec91b4c96490290f38ed49c80aae8b5b544e6d888aff9bd9e66096f4","category":"Apple"}
