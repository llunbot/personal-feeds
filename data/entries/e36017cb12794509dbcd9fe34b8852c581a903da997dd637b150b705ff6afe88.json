But what Nintendo didn't mention during the presentation was game pricing, either for standalone Switch 2 titles or the Switch 2 Edition upgrades for existing Switch games.</p>\n<p>We do have one solid first-party data point for US game pricing: <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/\"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, the console's flagship launch title, will cost $50 when you buy a digital copy as part of a Switch 2 bundle. But the game will cost $80 when you buy it on its own, $30 more than the pack-in version and $20 more than the usual $60 price for first-party Switch games.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean that $80 is the starting price for <em>all</em> Switch 2 games. <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/\"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, slated for a near-launch July 17 release, has a $69.99 MSRP, which is more in line with the $70 default for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S games. Nintendo hasn't explained that first-party pricing gap between the two games, but it could reflect <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s more involved online multiplayer, or simply be a way to push people on the fence in the direction of the cheaper bundled version.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e36017cb12794509dbcd9fe34b8852c581a903da997dd637b150b705ff6afe88","category":"Tech"}
