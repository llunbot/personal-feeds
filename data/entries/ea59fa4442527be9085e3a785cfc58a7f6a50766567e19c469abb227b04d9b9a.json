PBK Reviews has videos on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyEmChOMAN0\">Pixel 6 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nPQrPhCq4&amp;t=52s\">Pixel 6</a> for us to pick apart.</p>\n<p>Crack open either phone and you'll find a ton of heat dissipation. The back of the screen is covered in copper, so it's a big heat sink. Under the display, the interior is covered in sticky, heat-dissipating graphite film, making the phone look strikingly messier than the carefully curated insides of the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928\">iPhone 13</a>. Below that is <em>more</em> heat dissipation: an aluminum mid-plate that connects to the major chips with thermal tape.</p>\n<p>The back of the screen is also interesting. On the left is the under-display fingerprint reader, and you can see why companies are such fans of these components over capacitive rear fingerprint readers. An optical reader is a super-thin sticker on the back of the display—it looks like it's only a millimeter or so thick. You can also spot the cutout for the under-display brightness and proximity sensors, which, like the fingerprint reader, invisibly live under the display.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809184#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809184&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ea59fa4442527be9085e3a785cfc58a7f6a50766567e19c469abb227b04d9b9a","category":"Tech"}
