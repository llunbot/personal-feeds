To extend the call, the host can upgrade their Google account. Otherwise, the call will end at 60 minutes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle Meet offers many of the features that have made Zoom and Microsoft Teams so popular with both business and non-business users over the last year, including video conferencing for up to 100 participants, the option to schedule meetings, and screen-sharing capabilities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAnyone interested in using Google Meet can download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/hangouts-meet-by-google/id1013231476\">Meet iOS app</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> or head to <a href=\"http://meet.google.com/\">meet.google.com</a> to use the web browser version.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-meet/\">Google Meet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/google-meet-one-hour-cap-video-calls/\">Google Meet Places One-Hour Cap on Group Video Calls for Non-Paying Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-meet-places-one-hour-cap-on-group-video-calls-for-non-paying-users.2304203/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qCC66EugWp4:0cBonD8QjIo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qCC66EugWp4:0cBonD8QjIo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qCC66EugWp4\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c7ee56bb959e4bcc5ee7877d33b0052e86c85fb15eaa05155e2c73072d32c7a5","category":"Apple"}
