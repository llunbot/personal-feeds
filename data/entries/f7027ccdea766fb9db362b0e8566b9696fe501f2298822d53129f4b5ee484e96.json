Prices for these start at £6,799/$8,249/€7,399 for the 105 Di2 bike, rising to £8,599/$12,399/€9,399.</p>\n<p>Those looking for higher-spec builds will be able to customise their choice using the Ridley bike customisation programme.</p>\n<h2>The best of both worlds… and more?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Falcn RS road bike\" title=\"Ridley Falcn RS -
