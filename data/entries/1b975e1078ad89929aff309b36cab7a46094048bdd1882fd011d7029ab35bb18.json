However, thanks to the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, iPhone users look set for a long wait before they get to use many of the new iOS 19 features that Apple will inevitably promote at WWDC 2025. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1867080628728107027\">new post on X (Twitter)</a>, Gurman said that he continues to hear that engineers who would typically be transitioning to work on the next major iOS version are still occupied with implementing features for iOS 18 updates through iOS 18.4, expected in the spring.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman reports that this extended rollout of iOS 18 features through various point releases is creating a cascading effect on iOS 19's development timeline.

Apple is expected to preview this enhancement at WWDC 2025 in June, but it won't be available until iOS 19.4 in the spring of 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current focus on iOS 18 updates appears to be affecting more than just the Siri upgrade, though. Gurman in November said that \"a larger-than-usual number of features\" initially planned for iOS 19's release are now postponed until iOS 19.4. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>I continue to hear that the gradual rollout of features across iOS 18 to iOS 18.4 is leading to delays of some features scheduled for iOS 19.
