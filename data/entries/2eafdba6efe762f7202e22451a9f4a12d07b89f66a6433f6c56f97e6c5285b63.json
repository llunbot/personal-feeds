Last year, more than 45,000 students <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25300\">earned</a> doctorates in science and engineering, about an eight-fold increase compared to 1958.</p>\n<p>But this level of production of science and engineering PhD students is now in question. Facing significant cuts to federal science funding, some universities have <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/02/25/facing-nih-cuts-colleges-restrict-grad-student\">reduced or paused</a> their PhD admissions for the upcoming academic year. In response, experts are beginning to wonder about the short and long-term effects those shifts will have on the number of doctorates awarded and the consequent <a href=\"https://undark.org/2025/05/01/opinion-shrinking-science-jenga/\">impact on science</a> if PhD production does drop.</p>\n<p>Such questions touch on longstanding debates about academic labor. PhD training is a crucial part of nurturing scientific expertise. At the same time, some analysts have worried about an <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/06/22/how-phd-job-crisis-built-system-and-what-can-be-done-about-it-opinion\">oversupply of PhDs</a> in some fields, while students have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/04/we-must-stop-universities-exploiting-the-unpaid-labour-of-phd-students\">suggested</a> that universities are exploiting them as <a href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/oversupply-phds-threaten-american-science/\">low-cost labor</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/science-phds-face-a-challenging-and-uncertain-future/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/science-phds-face-a-challenging-and-uncertain-future/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Claudia LÃ³pez Llareda, Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2eafdba6efe762f7202e22451a9f4a12d07b89f66a6433f6c56f97e6c5285b63","category":"Tech"}
