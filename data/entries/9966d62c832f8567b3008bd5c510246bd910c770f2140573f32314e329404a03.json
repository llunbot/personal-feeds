Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.—Near-summer temperatures greeted a record crowd at the Daytona International Speedway in Florida last weekend. At the end of each January, the track hosts the Rolex 24, an around-the-clock endurance race that's now as high-profile as it has ever been during the event's 62-year history.</p>\n<p>Between the packed crowd and the 59-car grid, there's proof that sports car racing is in good shape. Some of that might be attributable to <em>Drive to Survive</em>'s rising tide lifting a bunch of non-F1 boats, but there's more to the story than just a resurgent interest in motorsport. The dramatic-looking <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-why-oems-are-so-interested-in-building-gtp-race-cars/\">GTP prototypes</a> have a lot to do with it—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/what-is-lmdh-and-why-are-we-so-excited-about-sportscar-racing-in-2023/\">powerful hybrid racing cars</a> from Acura, BMW, Cadillac, and Porsche are bringing in the fans and, in some cases, some pretty famous drivers with F1 or IndyCar wins on their resumes.</p>\n<p>But IMSA and the Rolex 24 is about more than just the top class of cars; in addition to the GTP hybrids, the field also comprised the very competitive pro-am LMP2 prototype class and a pair of classes (one for professional teams, another for pro-ams) for production-based machines built to a global set of rules, called GT3. (To be slightly confusing, in IMSA, those classes are known as GTD-Pro and GTD. More on sports car racing being needlessly confusing later.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000564#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000564&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
