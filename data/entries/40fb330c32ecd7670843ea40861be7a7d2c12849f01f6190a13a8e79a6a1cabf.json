Brown calls Chinese EVs \"an existential threat\" to the US automotive industry and says that allowing imports of cheap EVs from Chinese brands \"is inconsistent with a pro-worker industrial policy.\"</p>\n<p>Brown's <a href=\"https://www.brown.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/04112024evlettertopresidentbiden.pdf\">letter to the president</a> is the most recent to sound alarms about the threat of heavily subsidized Chinese EVs moving into established markets. Brands like BYD and MG have been on sale in the European Union for some years now, and last October, the EU <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202300160\">launched an anti-subsidy investigation</a> into whether the Chinese government is giving Chinese brands an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p>The EU probe won't wrap until November, but another report published this week found that government subsidies for green technology companies are prevalent in China. BYD, which now sells more EVs than Tesla, has benefited from almost $4 billion (3.7 billion euro) in direct help from the Chinese government in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/chinas-massive-subsidies-for-green-technologies/\">according to a study by the Kiel Institute</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016899#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016899&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
