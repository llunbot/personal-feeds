{"title":"Mission Accomplished: Trump Likes Apple’s Plan, Especially the Part About Mexico That I Don’t Think Was Real","link":"https://www.axios.com/2025/02/24/apple-investment-trump-tim-cook","date":1740430449000,"content":"\n<p>Mike Allen, writing for Axios, under the headline “Trump Manufacturing Win: Apple to Spend $500 Billion in U.S., Hire 20,000”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Trump met with Cook on Thursday in the Oval Office. Then Trump got\nso excited that he revealed the plans prematurely, saying\non-camera while meeting with governors that Cook is “investing\nhundreds of billions of dollars. I hope he’s announced it — I\nhope I didn’t announce it, but what the hell? All I do is tell the\ntruth — that’s what he told me. Now he has to do it, right?”</p>\n\n<p>“He is investing hundreds of billions of dollars and others, too,”\nTrump continued. “We will have a lot of chipmakers coming in, a\nlot of automakers coming in. They stopped two plants in Mexico\nthat were ... starting construction. They just stopped them — they’re going to build them here instead, because they don’t want\nto pay the tariffs. Tariffs are amazing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple and Tim Cook, I’m sure, are pleased as pie to have today’s announcement portrayed this way, as a “Trump manufacturing win”, despite the fact that it’s seemingly exactly in line with the trajectory Apple’s been on for US job creation since 2018, including a nearly identical announcement <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/\">in 2021</a> (that they largely, but <a href=\"https://abc11.com/post/apple-nc-east-coast-hub-on-hold-research-triangle-park-3-years-later-1-billion-project/14997218/\">not entirely</a>, followed through on).</p>\n\n<p>The Mexico angle rings weird to my ears, though. Bloomberg picked up on that too, running a headline over the weekend that read “<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tim-cook-meeting-trump-220006653.html\">Trump Says Cook Shifting Apple Manufacturing From Mexico to US</a>”.</p>\n\n<p>The last thing I remember Apple having assembled in Mexico were a small number of late model Apple Extended Keyboard II’s in 1995 (which were <a href=\"https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II\">inferior to their American-made models</a>, like the one I’m using to write this). It’s quite possible I’m overlooking some Mexican-made Apple products in the intervening decades, but if there are any, they’re not recent. So I suspect Tim Cook, in his meeting with Trump last week, sold him a bill of goods, and more or less convinced Trump that Apple <em>had</em> been planning to commission some new plants in Mexico (a country so loathsome <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/golfo_del_gringo_loco\">Trump confiscated their gulf</a>) but, thanks to President Trump’s inspiring leadership, Apple would instead be building those plants right here in the US, in the big old red state of Texas — when in fact all of this is pretty much exactly what Apple had been planning to do all along.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/mission-accomplished\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"131c9f8d29f7cb8c390e3ad79ce4c344d545275c185d15b37fc4628f4ecb76c2","category":"Tech"}
