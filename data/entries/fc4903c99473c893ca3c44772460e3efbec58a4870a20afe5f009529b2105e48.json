It started with some manuscripts placed on the arXiv toward the end of July, which purportedly described how to synthesize a compound called LK-99, which would act as a superconductor at temperatures above the boiling point of water. High enough that, if its synthesis and material properties worked out, it could allow us to replace metals with superconductors in a huge range of applications.</p>\n<p>Confusion quickly followed, as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/08/whats-going-on-with-the-reports-of-a-room-temperature-superconductor/\">nature of the chemical involved</a> made it difficult to know when you were looking at the behavior of LK-99 and when you were looking at related chemicals or even impurities.</p>\n<p>But the materials science community responded remarkably quickly. By the end of August, pure samples had been prepared, the role of impurities explored, and a strong consensus had developed: LK-99 was not a superconductor. Best yet, the work nicely provided explanations for why it had behaved a bit like one in a number of situations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965900#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965900&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc4903c99473c893ca3c44772460e3efbec58a4870a20afe5f009529b2105e48","category":"Tech"}
