Hot on the heels of the ingeniously named <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/11/adidas-is-back-in-the-cycling-shoe-game/\">Road Cycling shoe</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/adidas-is-at-it-again-with-the-gravel-cycling-shoe/\">Gravel Cycling shoe</a> comes the Indoor Cycling shoe. With a name as unambiguous as the Indoor Cycling shoe, Adidas has done my job for me. Thanks, that’s all from me, folks. Enjoy the pics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ping! Message from Caley Fretz.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>“Nice try, Ronan, but 53 words on new shoes from such a mainstream brand is simply not enough! Get to work! You are our indoor shoe guy!” </em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>No early Christmas break for me then so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adidas is firmly back in the cycling game. The Indoor Shoe is the brand’s fourth new cycling-specific offering in just over a year. With a lightweight and breathable upper, two large mesh vents on the forefoot, and a velcro strap, the shoes are laced with all the hallmarks of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/01/what-are-indoor-cycling-shoes-and-do-you-really-need-them/\">quality indoor cycling shoe</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adidas is making a step in the right direction to fight plastic waste on this one, as the upper is made of recycled materials and the shoe has at least 50% recycled content overall. A loop on the heel upper should help with getting the shoes on. Although, presumably, the velcro closure should make getting the shoe on and off quick and easy, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three-bolt cleat compatibility makes these the perfect sole mate for those using road pedal systems, although the absence of two-bolt compatibility will be sole-destroying for many spin class fans. And one more oversight: with <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/sex-and-the-city-just-torpedoed-pelotons-share-price/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr Big’s untimely passing</a>, it has been a tough week for indoor riding. We really don’t need any further slip-ups and so the complete lack of grip-enhancing features on the sole is equally concerning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One major question remains: can they be ridden outside? Sure looks like it may be possible. We will investigate and report back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to the good stuff. Shoe la la, these things look sweet. Offered in three sole-ful colours, Core Black, Acid Red, and Cloud White, and featuring the iconic Adidas three parallel equidistant stripes of identical width (as described in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/19/adidas-loses-three-stripe-trademark-battle-in-european-court\">court defeated trademark</a>), these are a shoe-in to take the indoor world by storm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, Ronan, enough puns! Stick a sock in it! [<em>Dave Rome would be proud of you, Ronan – Ed.</em>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Adidas Indoor Cycling shoes are available now in sizes 6-14, and they’re priced at US$130 / AU$210 / £110 / €130.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait goes on for a high-performance cycling shoe offering from Adidas. In the meantime, here’s a reminder of the fabulous <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/velosamba-shut-up-and-take-my-money-adidas/\">Velosamba</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.adidas.co.uk/the-indoor-cycling-shoes/GZ6354.html\">Adidas.com</a></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/exposed-adidas-indoor-cycling-shoes-are-indoor-cycling-shoes/\">Read More</a>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"64631187445765d40d37e345f48392c8a24204a62d2e032b81259262121e1d8d","category":"Cycling"}
