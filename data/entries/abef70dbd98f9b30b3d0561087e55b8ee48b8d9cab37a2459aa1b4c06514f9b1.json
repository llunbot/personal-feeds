However, cars do not have NFC functionality by default, so this is a feature that would need to be implemented by the automobile manufacturer in future models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.arenaev.com/europebound_lynk___co_z20_spotted_for_the_first_time-news-3744.php\">Z20</a> is believed to be Lynk &amp; Co's next car launch – and the company's first electric vehicle – so support for ‌Car Keys‌ could well be introduced with this model, which is expected to launch in various European markets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat can be done with ‌Car Keys‌ may vary by car manufacturer, but at a minimum, ‌Car Keys‌ can be used to unlock your car, lock your car, and start your car, which are the features available with a physical key. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced ‌Car Keys‌ in 2022, and car manufacturers like BMW, Rivian, Kia, and Hyundai have all implemented support for ‌Car Keys‌. Apple maintains a full list of vehicles that support ‌Car Keys‌ on its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/\">CarPlay model availability webpage</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/\">Car Keys</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/future-lynk-and-co-model-apple-car-keys/\">Future Lynk &amp; Co Vehicles Likely to Support Apple Car Keys</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-lynk-co-vehicles-likely-to-support-apple-car-keys.2433194/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"abef70dbd98f9b30b3d0561087e55b8ee48b8d9cab37a2459aa1b4c06514f9b1","category":"Apple"}
