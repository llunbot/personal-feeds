What changed? Apple added new options in <em>System Settings</em> &gt;<em> Desktop &amp; Dock</em> in the Windows section that can help you manage windows, but there’s one you may want to disable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple beefed up the Windows section between macOS 14 Sonoma and 15 Sequoia. In 13 Ventura and 14 Sonoma, you had the first three options: “Prefer tabs when opening documents,” “Ask to keep changes when closing documents,” and “Close windows when quitting an application.” Sequoia added a whopping four new ones:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Drag windows to screen edges to tile</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drag windows to menu bar to fill screen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hold [Option] key while dragging windows to tile</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tiled windows have margins</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-windows-dragging-sequoia-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-windows-dragging-sequoia-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1436w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-windows-dragging-sequoia-bordered.png?resize=300%2C223&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-windows-dragging-sequoia-bordered.png?resize=768%2C570&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mac911-windows-dragging-sequoia-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C891&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"891\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These tiling options are superb shortcuts when you need help with simple window organization. You can also hover over the green expand/resize button in the upper-left corner of any window to reveal a dropdown menu with several more options for arranging, filling, and resizing. (Also check out the <a href=\"https://manytricks.com/moom/\">third-party Moom app</a> for a greater array of controllable tiling options; see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/795332/moom-review.html\">our review</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the culprit among the new choices shown above for unexpected window action is “Drag windows to menu bar to fill screen.” It doesn’t take much of a slip to move the window to the top and have it resize. Unless that’s an option you can see yourself employing regularly, I suggest disabling it. This leaves the array of other choices available and lets you avoid an accidental resize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Cynthia.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
