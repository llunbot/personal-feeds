{"title":"EU's AltStore Gets First Native iOS Pornography App","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/03/eu-altstore-porn-app/","date":1738609989000,"content":"In the European Union, the Digital Markets Act allows developers to distribute iOS apps through alternate app stores. While Apple checks those apps for malware and other malicious content, there are few restrictions on subject matter, unlike Apple's own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. As a result, EU users can now download the first dedicated native pornography app created for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/hot-tub-app-eu.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/113940550587737112\">Called Hot Tub</a>, the app is available <a href=\"https://altstore.io\">through the AltStore PAL</a>, an EU app marketplace from developer Riley Testut. The app promises a private and secure way to browse adult content, without ads or tracking. \"An elegant, native porn app. Thoughtfully designed, ethically made, and free to use,\" reads the app's description. As noted by <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/hot-tub-the-first-native-iphone-porn-app-arrives-in-eu/\">TechCrunch</a></em>, the app lets users search and play videos from a number of other sites like Pornhub and Xvideos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌App Store‌ in the European Union, U.S., and other countries <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\">has clear rules</a> against sexual or pornographic material, which means Hot Tub is not an app that could exist without the DMA-mandated option for alternative app distribution. Outside of the European Union, adult content is limited to web browsers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor apps distributed through marketplaces like AltStore, Apple uses a Notarization process to check for malware, security threats, and fraud. Apple also ensures that apps are functioning as promised, but sideloaded apps don't have user protections and are not required to adhere to ‌App Store‌ content rules and can distribute pornography, or feature other prohibited content like hate speech, weapons, tobacco, vaping, alcohol, and legal drug consumption. Back in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/phil-schiller-on-risks-of-iphone-app-marketplaces/\">February 2024</a>, Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a> made it clear that Apple would have no control over the content in EU apps distributed through app marketplaces.<blockquote>We have dealt with a lot of input from families, from governments, on things that we need to do to try to either not allow certain kinds of objectionable content on our App Store, or give users control over that experience to decide what's best for themselves--and we have rules around that. Those rules will not apply in another marketplace unless they choose to make rules of their own, [with] whatever criteria they come up with. Does that increase the risk of users, and families, running into objectionable content or other experiences? Yes, it does.</blockquote>AltStore was one of the first alternative app marketplaces to launch in the European Union after Apple implemented changes to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act last year. Alternative app marketplaces are required to pay a Core Technology Fee for each install, and while the AltStore initially charged €1.50 plus tax per user per year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/altstore-pal-now-free-epic-games/\">Epic Games gave it</a> a \"MegaGrant,\" which means AltStore is now free to download.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHot Tub may also need to pay an Apple fee at some point, but that will depend on number of downloads and revenue earned. The app is free, but there is a pro subscription available. Apple charges apps a Core Technology Fee (CTF) for each install after their first one million installs, but the fees don't kick in right away for small developers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/apple-updates-core-technology-fee-eu/\">latest rule change</a> in May 2024, apps that earn under 10 million euros per year do not have to pay the CTF for a three-year period. Apps that earn over 10 million euros but under 50 million euros will only pay a maximum of one million euros for three years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHot Tub is available as a <a href=\"https://hottubapp.io/download\">beta right now</a>, and it is available to all users in the European Union. U.S. users are not able to download the app because sideloading apps is not permitted.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/03/eu-altstore-porn-app/\">EU's AltStore Gets First Native iOS Pornography App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eus-altstore-gets-first-native-ios-pornography-app.2448677/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ad0b0849ccc35e4bedf6dcd25c8ebabe6ffd3576c39e0f50d7c7667b3eabdb35","category":"Apple"}
