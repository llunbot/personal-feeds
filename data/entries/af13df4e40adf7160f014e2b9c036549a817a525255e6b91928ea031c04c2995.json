On Thursday, Google analysts presented evidence bolstering the critique after finding that spies working on behalf of the Kremlin used exploits that are “identical or strikingly similar” to those sold by spyware makers Intellexa and NSO Group.</p>\n<p>The hacking outfit, tracked under names including APT29, Cozy Bear, and Midnight Blizzard, is widely assessed to work on behalf of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or the SVR. Researchers with Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which tracks nation-state hacking, <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/state-backed-attackers-and-commercial-surveillance-vendors-repeatedly-use-the-same-exploits/\">said Thursday</a> that they observed APT29 using exploits identical or closely identical to those first used by commercial exploit sellers NSO Group of Israel and Intellexa of Ireland. In both cases, the Commercial Surveillance Vendors’ exploits were first used as zero-days, meaning when the vulnerabilities weren’t publicly known and no patch was available.</p>\n<h2>Identical or strikingly similar</h2>\n<p>Once patches became available for the vulnerabilities, TAG said, APT29 used the exploits in watering hole attacks, which infect targets by surreptitiously planting exploits on sites they’re known to frequent. TAG said APT29 used the exploits as n-days, which target vulnerabilities that have recently been fixed but not yet widely installed by users.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046289#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046289&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af13df4e40adf7160f014e2b9c036549a817a525255e6b91928ea031c04c2995","category":"Tech"}
