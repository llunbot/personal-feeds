Tracking lap times back-to-back is one of the most basic tools for getting quicker – whether you are talking DH, cyclocross, track, or anywhere in between. But the little inaccuracies in start &amp; stop times, and GPS drift from the average recording devices, all quickly add up to a lot of imprecision, while many important races are won or lost by fractions of a second. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new BYB Chrono aims to bring more precision to keeping track of how fast you go each lap, with a simple setup that you can pair with other devices to add more &amp; more accuracy…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BYB Chrono lap timers bring precision to seeing how fast you ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session.jpg\" alt=\"BYB Chrono GPS lap timer helps you find where to go faster, DH training\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_SH-training-session-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/BYB)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, BYB is no stranger to harnessing more data to make you faster. Their comprehensive telemetry data collection systems have been helping World Cup DH racers get faster for years. Collecting hi-res position, suspension action, and braking data so racers can see how they can optimize bike setup and push harder on the racetrack. But full pro-level telemetry systems are expensive – often almost 2000€ for even an “affordable” complete setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for just a fraction of that price, BYB thinks their advanced lap timer setup can still give you the edge over the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s this lap timer all about?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount.jpg\" alt=\"BYB Chrono GPS lap timer helps you find where to go faster, fork mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_strap-on-fork-mount-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BYB wanted to bring some of their World Cup race-proven data acquisition training tech down to a more accessible price level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>A new device to simplify the whole process and make it even more affordable to everyone</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BYB Chrono is a lap timer that packs in high-resolution GPS ride tracking, a built-in speed sensor, and optional external lap triggers. Combining more accurate GPS positioning with more accurate start/stop timing, BYB says it provides much more useful insight into your real ride times and more room to improve performance in training.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger.jpg\" alt=\"BYB Chrono GPS lap timer helps you find where to go faster, helmet mount &amp; external triggers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_helmet-mount-and-external-trigger-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrono can operate in 4 different modes, depending on how you pair it with other devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>GPS-only is the simplest. Just strap it on a ride.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GPS + the built-in Speed Sensor. Put a magnet on your spokes and strap Chrono to the bike, then speed &amp; distance accuracy gets a boost.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GPS + the optional External Trigger. On looped tracks set one external trigger at the finish line. Or on a single run open track set a pair of external triggers on the ground. When you ride past, you’ll get perfectly precise timing, just like on race day. You can even set two on a short section you’re sessioning, to dial in the fastest line with newfound precision.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GPS + Speed Sensor + External Trigger. Put it all together for the most accurate training data you’ll likely ever have to work with.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers.jpg\" alt=\"BYB Chrono GPS lap timer helps you find where to go faster, training open or closed tracks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_lap-circuit-types-with-triggers-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"BYB Chrono GPS lap timer and external triggers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-297x99.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-800x267.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-120x40.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-768x256.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-1536x512.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_time-and-external-triggers-2048x683.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrono is made up of a single lightweight black box and two optional red remote triggers. All are compact, about 4x8cm, waterproof, and powered by rechargeable batteries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core of what makes BYB Chrono a better training tool is better GPS. Said to have been developed based on more precise automotive tech, Chrono’s GPS is accurate to a resolution of only 50cm. That is possible because of the latest multi-band and multi-constellation GPS chip. Plus, Chrono measures your position at 25Hz. That’s 25 GPS location points logged every second. This always-on high data sampling rate creates “<em>perfectly drawn trajectories, smoothly curved and not jagged, even at high speeds</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control.jpg\" alt=\"BYB Chrono GPS lap timer helps you find where to go faster, smartphone app control\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BYB-Chrono-GPS-lap-timer-helps-you-find-where-to-go-faster_smartphone-app-control-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrono comes with a free smartphone app that lets you quickly download your lap time data mid-training session.
