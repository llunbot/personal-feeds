That's not the case, with all four iPhones supporting the 802.11be Wi-Fi 7 standard with 2x2 MIMO.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Wi-Fi 7, the new iPhones can send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously for faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 offers peak theoretical download speeds of more than 40Gb/s, 4x more than the prior Wi-Fi 6E standard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPhone 16‌ users should see improved latency and better performance in dense environments with the Wi-Fi 7 standard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌iPhone 16‌ models will be available for pre-order this Friday, and are set to launch on September 20.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/all-iphone-16-models-support-wi-fi-7/\">All iPhone 16 Models Support Wi-Fi 7</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphone-16-models-support-wi-fi-7.2435519/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d174d0158488c28a6cc22c5e8789a26e88e59127dc7577e7df9f5c909b4a73c","category":"Apple"}
