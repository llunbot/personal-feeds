In his plea agreement, California pilot Trevor Jacob admitted to \"deliberately destroying\" the plane wreckage and repeatedly lying to officials.</p>\n<p>The crimes of destruction and concealment with intent to impede a federal investigation carry a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a potential fine of up to $250,000. The Los Angeles district court may impose a lesser sentence due to the plea deal, though.</p>\n<p>Jacob is scheduled to appear in court in the coming weeks, the DOJ reported. A DOJ public information officer, Ciaran McEvoy, told Ars that Jacob has not yet pleaded guilty. After an initial court appearance—essentially a bond hearing—a change of plea hearing will be scheduled. If Jacob pleads guilty at that hearing, a federal judge will schedule a sentencing hearing several months later. From there, Jacob would meet with the US Probation Office, which will draft a confidential pre-sentencing report recommending the sentence that the office thinks he deserves. Jacob and the prosecutors can either agree or disagree with that sentencing report, and then, ultimately, a judge will determine what sentence is imposed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939047#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939047&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae5363c4c6ad9c79eb7f4b660d2d64a6059b47e5b6cd22a3f416725d81bb78dc","category":"Tech"}
