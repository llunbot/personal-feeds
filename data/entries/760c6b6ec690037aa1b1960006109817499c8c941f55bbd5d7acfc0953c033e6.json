In an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112524zor_8m58.pdf\">order</a> issued today, the court invited the Department of Justice's solicitor general to file a brief \"expressing the views of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>In <em>Sony Music Entertainment v. Cox Communications</em>, the major record labels argue that cable provider Cox should be held liable for failing to terminate users who were repeatedly flagged for infringement based on their IP addresses being connected to torrent downloads. There was a mixed ruling at the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit as the appeals court affirmed a jury's finding that Cox was guilty of willful contributory infringement but reversed a verdict on vicarious infringement \"because Cox did not profit from its subscribers' acts of infringement.\"</p>\n<p>That ruling <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/court-blocks-1-billion-copyright-ruling-that-punished-isp-for-its-users-piracy/\">vacated</a> a $1 billion damages award and ordered a new damages trial. Cox and Sony are both seeking a Supreme Court review. Cox wants to overturn the finding of willful contributory infringement, while Sony wants to reinstate the $1 billion verdict.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/supreme-court-may-decide-whether-isps-must-terminate-users-accused-of-piracy/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/supreme-court-may-decide-whether-isps-must-terminate-users-accused-of-piracy/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"760c6b6ec690037aa1b1960006109817499c8c941f55bbd5d7acfc0953c033e6","category":"Tech"}
