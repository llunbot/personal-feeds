{"title":"Save 26% on Logitech’s MX Mechanical Mini for Mac keyboard—and get a bonus","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2315226/save-26-on-logitechs-mx-mechanical-mini-for-mac-keyboard-and-get-a-bonus.html","date":1714059706000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple makes very good keyboards, but some users don’t like the feel of the keys–that’s important, especially if you spend most of your day working at your Mac. Many people like the clicky feel of a mechanical keyboard, and you can get a discount on some clicky goodness on Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LK63PKB/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Logitech MX Mechanical Mini for Mac keyboard for 26 percent off</a> the regular price–it’s $111.51, down from the regular price of $150, the best price we’ve ever seen. It’s a mini keyboard, so it doesn’t have a number pad, but it has low-profile keys and a backlight that automatically adjusts to your room’s lighting. It connects via Bluetooth, charges through USB-C, and is available in a classy pale grey and white combo. Logitech also offers a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LK3JCHX/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">space gray/dark gray version</a>, but its price cut isn’t as much–that model is $125.49, a 16 percent discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Logitech’s MX Mechanical Mini has other cool features. It can connect to up to three different Bluetooth devices (so a Mac, iPad, and iPhone), and switching between them is done with the touch of a button. The keyboard is made of recycled plastic and aluminum, and it includes a one-year limited warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amazon sale (only for the pale grey/white keyboard model) comes with a bonus: Two free months of the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan, or one free month of Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps. That’s like getting another $39.96 ($19.98 for two months) or $54.99 off, respectively, though you’ll need to pay the full monthly price if you want to keep it. The Creative Cloud offer is automatically applied at checkout and you’ll receive an email code for the free offer once the keyboard ships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we haven’t reviewed this particular model, we’re big fans of Logitech’s keyboards. Mechanical keyboards are generally pretty pricey, especially with Mac keycaps, so go grab this deal if you’re looking for a new keyboard for your Apple device.</p>\n\nKeyboards, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"803663930d065863f22b40baf3f5db2d4369a494e30c552d3158a9949e4412df","category":"Apple"}
