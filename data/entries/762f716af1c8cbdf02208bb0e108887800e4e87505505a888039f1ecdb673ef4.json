However, there's a good chance this is something Apple intends to implement but has not yet got around to doing so in the developer beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ also allows users to change the two Flashlight and Camera shortcut buttons on the Lock Screen to an action of their choice for the first time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ability to change these Lock Screen controls is part of a wave of new customization features in ‌‌iOS 18‌‌, which includes app icon color-changing capabilities and more. The first public beta is set to arrive in July and the official release of ‌iOS 18‌ is scheduled for the fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-lock-screen-multicolor-clock-option/\">iOS 18 Lock Screen Customization Options Include Multicolor Clock</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-lock-screen-customization-options-include-multicolor-clock.2428985/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"762f716af1c8cbdf02208bb0e108887800e4e87505505a888039f1ecdb673ef4","category":"Apple"}
