The big news today is two totally new Revel models – The ReRun eMTB and the Ritual enduro bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being naysayers in the early days, Revel has introduced pedal assist power to their lineup with the mid-powered, 165mm ReRun e-enduro bike. Catering to non-assisted riders, the Ritual is a new, long travel enduro bike which debuts Revel’s new in-frame storage compartment. Revel has also announced two new colors for their popular Ranger XC bike, which you can check out below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Revel Re-Run eMTB:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side.webp\" alt=\"2025 Revel ReRun, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-eMTB-side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Revel crew admits they were one of the brands that once said they’d never build an ebike but… For 2025, the ReRun is their all-new, nimble and lightweight mid-power E-enduro bike. The ReRun is available with carbon frames only, and all models and sizes roll on MX wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ReRuns come equipped with 170mm forks, but the frame can host a 180mm fork if you wish to go longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage.webp\" alt=\"2025 Revel ReRun, linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-linkage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Revel’s first pedal-assist bike offers 165 mm of rear travel, driven by a CBF (Canfield Balance Formula) linkage. This linkage features a co-rotating dual-link design, which aims to provide solid pedalling power while keeping the suspension active at all times. Revel says the linkage offers great small bump compliance, eliminates brake jack, and maintains its efficiency regardless of the rider’s chosen sag setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle.webp\" alt=\"2025 Revel ReRun, front angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-ReRun-front-angle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ReRun frames include direct mount chain guides, up to 36t chainrings (or 34t oval) can be run, and the frame accepts 31.6mm seat posts.

The Rituals feature carbon frames only, with 165mms of rear travel and 170mm forks. Like the ReRun, the Ritual frame can run a longer 180mm fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ritual’s lengthy travel is managed by a CBF suspension linkage, with CNC finished suspension links. The pivot bearings are all contained within the suspension links rather than the frame, allowing for a stronger frame design and longer bearing life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel.webp\" alt=\"2025 Revel Ritual, linkage and wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-linkage-wheel-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Small and medium Ritual frames roll on MX wheels, while the large and XL frames run a full 29” wheelset. This split wheel sizing is part of Revel’s new ‘Ratio Fit Philosophy’, pertaining to geometry, suspension tuning and wheel size. With the goal of every rider getting a consistent feel from their bike, Revel has introduced a wheel size split, size-specific chainstays, and size-specific suspension kinematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the Ratio Fit Philosophy, Revel intends riders to stick with 29” rear wheels on the larger framed Rituals. Running a 27.5” rear wheel will affect the frame’s suspension and geometry, negatively impacting the bike’s intended ride qualities. Thus, it is officially not recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup.webp\" alt=\"2025 Revel Ritual, frame closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Revel-Ritual-frame-closeup-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Unfortunately, this is the best photo Revel provided of their in-frame storage.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ritual is the first Revel bike to feature an in-frame storage compartment and accessory mounts on the underside of the top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key fitments include a 73mm BSA threaded BB with ISCG05 tabs, clearance for 36t (or 34t oval) chainrings, and a 31.6mm seat mast.
