Caveworks says that the Rivet is a direct competitor of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zwift-ride-bike-indoor-trainer-stationary-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift Ride</a>. Two-and-a-half years in the making, the Rivet is a high-performance indoor cycling frameset capable of fitting riders of all sizes and is compatible with all thru-axle direct-drive smart trainers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RIVET_FRAMEONLY.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RIVET_FRAMEONLY.jpg\" alt=\"CaveWorks Rivet Indor Bike frame only\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RIVET_FRAMEONLY.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RIVET_FRAMEONLY-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RIVET_FRAMEONLY-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RIVET_FRAMEONLY-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Rivet Frameset only (Photos/Caveworks)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivet comes nearly ready to ride. Just open the box, install the included handlebars, add your pedals, and mount the Rivet to the trainer. Caveworks wanted the Rivet to deliver value without sacrificing quality. Complete builds are spec’d with high-quality components carefully selected for indoor use. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_tensioner.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_tensioner.jpg\" alt=\"CaveWorks Rivet Indor Bike singlespeed tensioner\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_tensioner.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_tensioner-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_tensioner-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_tensioner-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Single Speed chain tensioner. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivet conforms to bicycle industry standards making it easy to swap parts. Its 12×142 rear spacing works with any thru-axle smart trainer. And, the 12×110 front axle means it works with front-end accessories, like the Wahoo Kickr Climb. It also sports a 68mm threaded bottom bracket and a 30.9 seatpost. This makes it easy for users to swap parts to their desired components, making it easier to replicate their outdoor bike’s feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_cranks.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_cranks.jpg\" alt=\"CaveWorks Rivet Indor Bike crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_cranks.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_cranks-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_cranks-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_cranks-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivet can be used as a bike fit adjustment tool as well. Riders can apply their outdoor bike measurements to the Rivet before exploring the impact of minor adjustments. Or, even test the fit of a bike before purchasing in a controlled setting with minimal tools and effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>One-Size-Fits-Most</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rivet is one-size-fits-most. Its geometry is designed to make use of a 450mm, 30.9mm diameter seatpost and Caveworks proprietary adjustable stem which is essentially another seatpost that allows for a huge range of adjustment. It’s designed to cover a wide range of riding positions, including replicating fits for mountain bikes, endurance road bikes, gravel bikes, cyclocross bikes, TT bikes, and performance road bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_GearedBuild_1080x1080.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_GearedBuild_1080x1080.jpg\" alt=\"CaveWorks Rivet Indor Bike Hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_GearedBuild_1080x1080.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_GearedBuild_1080x1080-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_GearedBuild_1080x1080-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_GearedBuild_1080x1080-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Geared with Shimano GRX</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It can fit riders ranging from approximately 4’10” to 6’6″, meaning multiple users in a household can utilize a single Rivet. Below are some of Rivet’s geometry highlights:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Rivet replicates virtually any reach or saddle-to-handlebar drop, regardless of your handlebar preference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Rivets geometry lengthens as rider height increases due to its forward-reaching headtube. This replicates the progression of top tube length from smaller to larger bicycle frames, ensuring that riders of most sizes will be able to apply their preferred stack and reach to the same Rivet.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Rivet’s seatpost angle offers a typical range of saddle setback that progresses appropriately over the range of adjustment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Because the Rivet uses an industry standard 30.9mm diameter seatpost, atypical saddle positions are achievable simply by swapping out the Caveworks seatpost for the 30.9mm seatpost of the rider’s choosing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multiple riders in the same household can have their own saddle and seatpost that they can swap out quickly and easily on a single Rivet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"CaveWorks Rivet Indor Bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cavworks_saddle-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rivet Weight and Footprint</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivet is made of steel that has been shaped to look good and ride good. The powder-coating gives the Rivet an industrial look as well as protects it from corrosion. Yet, despite its hardy look, the Rivet is claimed to weigh under 30lbs across all of the build options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who need to move their indoor setup around, the Rivet’s light weight means less strain and effort when compared to smart bikes or other indoor bike frames. Plus, the Rivets have a smaller footprint when compared to smart bikes and outdoor bikes. This makes it a great choice for those with limited space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_Stem.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_Stem.jpg\" alt=\"CaveWorks Rivet Indor Bike handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_Stem.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_Stem-297x254.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_Stem-120x103.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caveworks_Stem-768x657.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compared to Zwift Ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Caveworks, the Rivet offers several advantages when compared to the Zwift Ride. For instance, “<em>the <strong>RIVET</strong> prioritizes quality and durability (more metal, less plastic); it has standard component compatibility, offering unlimited configurations and serviceability; it is compatible with all thru-axle direct-drive smart trainers, as well as front-end accessories like the Wahoo Kickr Climb; it offers more flexible fit adjustability through the full range of adjustment; and it is much lighter while still delivering exceptional mechanical performance”.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, there are no Zwift Play controllers built into the Rivet, but for those that want to run them, the standard controllers can be strapped to the hoods. It seems that Zwift Play also has the edge with an optional tablet holder, but it seems like that would be something Caveworks could add in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rivet Features Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>4130 steel frame, powder coated for durability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12x142mm rear axle spacing, with UDH</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12x110mm front axle spacing (offering enhanced front-end rigidity and compatible with the Wahoo Kickr Climb gradient simulator)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30.9mm seat post and stem tube diameter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>68mm Threaded BB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removable feet with spacers to accommodate third-party trainers of varying rear axle heights (essentially, the spacers adjust front-end heights according to whether the third-party trainer was designed to be ridden at ground level or with a riser block)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mounting for 2 water bottle cages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proprietary caveworks adjustable stem, 6061 aluminum, anodized black</li>\n\n\n\n<li>120mm of continuous fore-aft adjustment, all achieved with a quick turn of the adjustment knob.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Caveworks Rivet Tech Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Frame: 4130 steel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear Spacing: 12x142mm rear axle spacing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Front Spacing: 12x110mm front axle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatpost diameter: 30.9mm seatpost</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bottom Bracket: 68mm, BSA threaded bottom bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Front-end spacers level the front end for a range of thru-axle direct-drive smart trainers </li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 water bottle cage options positioned on the front legs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stem: Proprietary adjustable stem, 6061 aluminum, 120mm of fore-aft adjustment</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handlebar: 42cm, 16-degree flare</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bar tape: Ergon BT Allroad, 2.5mm thick for comfort</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shifters: “Dummy hoods” or Shimano GRX</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatpost: 30.9mm diameter, 450mm length</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saddle: 143mm width, Chromoly rails</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crankset: 170mm, 172.5mm, 175mm lengths available</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chainring: 48t</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chain: KMC X12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chain tensioner: Oversize 14t ceramic bearing pulley (single-speed option)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear Derailleur: Shimano GRX 12-speed (geared option)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rivet Options and Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivet is available for pre-order right now, with deliveries expected in October.
