Today, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-23/how-sonos-botched-an-app-and-infuriated-its-customers\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> delved into what went wrong at Sonos ahead of when the app launched, and why it came out anyway.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/sonos-redesigned-app.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nSonos had to come out with a new app when it launched the Sonos Ace headphones because of \"technical debt.\" The company basically spent time working on new features instead of updating outdated code written in obsolete languages, leading to infrastructure issues. Sonos put off addressing the underlying technical debt, but introducing the headphones required the Sonos app and the cloud setup behind it to be overhauled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the time the app was in development, Sonos laid off some of its employees to cut costs and also did some internal restructuring that was \"causing chaos\" by separating people who had worked together for years. As the app's launch approached, employees protested \"forcefully,\" even resorting to yelling and screaming, because it was clear the app wasn't ready to launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFormer Sonos employees told <em>Bloomberg</em> that Sonos was prioritizing promises to investors and attracting new customers rather than ensuring equipment owned by longtime Sonos customers continued to work. One employee said they were afraid to push back further on the app's launch because it could lead to them losing their job.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos' lead counsel Eddie Lazarus did an internal investigation into the app's development and told <em>Bloomberg</em> that the app <em>was</em> delayed, from early 2024 to May 2024, and that there had been no \"yelling\" or \"screaming\" in meetings. Sonos apparently had a list of what it considered \"essential\" bugs that needed to be fixed pre-launch, but it decided that less critical bugs could wait until the app was released. \"Our list of essential bugs, obviously, was not comprehensive enough,\" Lazarus told <em>Bloomberg</em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos expects to miss its annual revenue target by $200 million after the app debacle. In August, it laid off some employees, and it told others that yearly bonuses and merit-based pay raises have been canceled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos CEO Patrick Spence <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/sonos-app-update-apology/\">apologized to Sonos customers</a> in July and committed to regular updates to address bugs and add missing features. The company considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/sonos-bring-back-old-app/\">bringing back the old app</a> as it worked on the new version, but it turned out <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/20/sonos-not-rereleasing-old-app/\">that wasn't possible</a> because of the updates made to the cloud servers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/sonos-delays-product-launces-to-fix-app/\">decided to delay</a> two upcoming product launches in 2024 to instead focus on improving the Sonos app, and the company has \"pulled together the very best and most experienced engineers\" that it has to work on the app until it is fixed.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/\">Sonos</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/sonos-app-development-insight/\">Sonos Execs Launched Ill-Received App Despite Employee Protests</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-execs-launched-ill-received-app-despite-employee-protests.2437891/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0864795ca1e6abc15ac57922932af5a4fb849f580fbf1acd9d84690b0b0df95f","category":"Apple"}
