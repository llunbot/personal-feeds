The filings, first spotted by <em><a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/12/apple-has-won-another-70-design-patents-for-apple-vision-pro-including-one-for-a-new-headset-cover-a-new-magsafe-battery.html\">PatentlyApple</a></em>, include a never-before-seen Vision Pro accessory with a range of accompanying images showing various angles of it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe accessory's design seems to match the Vision Pro's headband, using a soft-touch woven fabric to cover the entire front and sides of the headset. It does not cover the back of the headset or Light Seal in any way, likely being designed to help protect the headset's EyeSight display from scratches and other damage. The cover also features a tab on the left-hand side to help remove it from the headset easily.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe other notable design patent won by Apple in the latest batch of filings is a Vision Pro battery, incorrectly identified by some websites as a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> battery pack, showing a recessed port. This is worth highlighting as it confirms that the battery unit's cable is removable.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/official-vision-pro-cover-accessory-emerges/\">Official Vision Pro Cover Accessory Emerges in New Apple Design Patent</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/official-vision-pro-cover-accessory-emerges-in-new-apple-design-patent.2414768/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f9de4297d896dae07345d0b8ba08c37023919cf90998005d7886bf1313960e92","category":"Apple"}
