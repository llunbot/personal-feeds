They connect to the app just like a Mac or an iPhone to alert you when something is left behind and use the network to quickly find lost items. You can easily put one in a pocket or a bag, but you’ll need a case or keyring if you want to attach it to a set of keys or a zipper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We rarely see AirTags go on sale and we don’t know how long it will last, so if you want a pack, go grab it before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\niPhone, Mobile Phone Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"62eee7a3422bdf67deaff50cc388691243300416b95266bbcabc45b7b550b707","category":"Apple"}
