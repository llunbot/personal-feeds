This liquid alloy has the potential to turn paper and other materials into gadgets that can do some things on their own.</p>\n<p>Liquid metal is already used in smart objects like circuits and wearable sensors—but not as a coating. Inspired by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/origami-inspired-artificial-muscles-outperform-human-ones/\">origami</a>, a team of scientists led by Bo Yuan of Tsinghua University in China has figured out a way to formulate liquid metal and apply it with a stamp so it sticks to paper without an adhesive, which has never been possible before. In a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(23)00193-5\">study</a> recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science<i>, </i>the scientists showed that paper coated in the metal can be crafted into origami shapes and re-fold itself. The metal coating also conducts heat and electricity. It’s like magic. Almost.</p>\n<h2>A sticky alloy</h2>\n<p>Because the particles in liquid metal tend to stay so close together, it is difficult to get it to adhere to any surface without something that acts as glue. But these adhesives usually have a negative effect on the metal’s properties, such as its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/what-liquid-would-be-the-best-heat-transfer.1072348/\">conductivity</a>. Yuan and his team wanted a liquid metal that could stick to paper without an adhesive. They used an alloy of bismuth, indium, and tin oxide (BiInSn) and tested how well it performed next to an indium/gallium alloy (eGaIn).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949507#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949507&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cd401428736bb6919245c25ca9d7a89a3a2ccfacc4d2cc9855188a36a0e194be","category":"Tech"}
