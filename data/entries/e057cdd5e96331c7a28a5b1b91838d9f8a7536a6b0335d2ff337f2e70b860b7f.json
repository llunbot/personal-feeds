The kit with 16 triangles is now $300, down from $410, and Skylight pricing now starts at $200, down from $250. Price cuts are applicable to most of the multi-piece kits that Nanoleaf sells, along with expansion packs and bundles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe updated pricing is available today from the <a href=\"https://nanoleaf.me/\">Nanoleaf website</a>, and will be rolling out to retailers like Amazon and Best Buy soon.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nanoleaf/\">Nanoleaf</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/nanoleaf-lower-pricing/\">Nanoleaf Lowers Prices for Shapes, Lines, Skylight and More With New 'SmarterLife' Initiative</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nanoleaf-lowers-prices-for-shapes-lines-skylight-and-more-with-new-smarterlife-initiative.2449605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e057cdd5e96331c7a28a5b1b91838d9f8a7536a6b0335d2ff337f2e70b860b7f","category":"Apple"}
