I'm not giving anybody investment advice, by the way.\" Cook said that Apple has no \"immediate\" plans to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment for its products or within <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the company's lack of \"immediate\" plans to get involved in the world of cryptocurrency, Cook did say that it's something Apple is \"looking into.\" Cook said that Apple has no plans to invest in cryptocurrency given his belief that \"people [don't] buy Apple stock to get exposure to crypto.
