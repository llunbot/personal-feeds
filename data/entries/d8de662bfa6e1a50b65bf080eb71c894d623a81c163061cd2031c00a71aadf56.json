{"title":"Putting M1 Max GPU Performance in Context","link":"https://twitter.com/andysomerfield/status/1451859111843356676","date":1635295654000,"content":"\n<p>Andy Somerfield, lead for (the great) Affinity Photo app:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Photo, an ideal GPU would do three different things well: 1.)\nHigh compute performance 2.) Fast on-chip bandwidth 3.) Fast\ntransfer on and off the GPU.</p>\n\n<p>Way back in 2009, no GPU did all three things well - but we\nthought that eventually the industry would get there, so we took a\nrisk and designed the entire architecture based on that\nassumption. Things didn’t go entirely to plan.</p>\n\n<p>We shipped Photo in 2015 - six years after the design phase -\nwithout GPU compute support :(</p>\n\n<p>A GPU which did all the things we needed simply didn’t exist. We\nwondered if we had backed the wrong horse. Happily, a short while\nlater it did exist - but it was in an iPad 😬!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fast-forward a few tweets in the thread to today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The #M1Max is the fastest GPU we have ever measured in the\n@affinitybyserif Photo benchmark. It outperforms the W6900X — a\n$6000, 300W desktop part — because it has immense compute\nperformance, immense on-chip bandwidth and immediate transfer of\ndata on and off the GPU (UMA).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A laptop GPU outperforming a $6,000 300-watt (300 watts!) desktop GPU. Bananas. But here I am, typing this sentence on that laptop.</p>\n\n<p>The entire Apple silicon story — along with the Affinity Photo team’s prescient bet — feels like a perfect illustration of <a href=\"https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/bill_gates_404193\">the Bill Gates axiom</a>: “We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don’t let yourself be lulled into inaction.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/26/m1-max-affinity\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d8de662bfa6e1a50b65bf080eb71c894d623a81c163061cd2031c00a71aadf56","category":"Tech"}
