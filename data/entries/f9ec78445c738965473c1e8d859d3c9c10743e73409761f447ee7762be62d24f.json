Chief among them: mandatory resets, required or restricted use of certain characters, and the use of security questions.</p>\n<p>Choosing strong passwords and storing them safely is one of the most challenging parts of a good cybersecurity regimen. More challenging still is complying with password rules imposed by employers, federal agencies, and providers of online services. Frequently, the rules—ostensibly to enhance security hygiene—actually undermine it. And yet, the nameless rulemakers impose the requirements anyway.</p>\n<h2>Stop the madness, please!</h2>\n<p>Last week, NIST released its second public draft of <a href=\"https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html\">SP 800-63-4</a>, the latest version of its Digital Identity Guidelines. At roughly 35,000 words and filled with jargon and bureaucratic terms, the document is nearly impossible to read all the way through and just as hard to understand fully. It sets both the technical requirements and recommended best practices for determining the validity of methods used to authenticate digital identities online. Organizations that interact with the federal government online are required to be in compliance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052508#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052508&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f9ec78445c738965473c1e8d859d3c9c10743e73409761f447ee7762be62d24f","category":"Tech"}
