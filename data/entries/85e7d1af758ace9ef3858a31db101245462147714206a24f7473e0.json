Now Musk apparently regrets dismissing Thorleifsson.</p>\n<p>“I would like to apologize to Halli for my misunderstanding of his situation,” Musk tweeted. “It was based on things I was told that were untrue or, in some cases, true, but not meaningful.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922606#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922606&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85e7d1af758ace9ef3858a31db101245462147714206a24f7473e0","category":"Tech"}
