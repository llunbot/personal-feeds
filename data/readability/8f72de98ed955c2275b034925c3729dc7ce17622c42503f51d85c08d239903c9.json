The attacks began soon after the peloton left Puerto Lumbreras, but it took almost two hours and 70 km for an 11-strong breakaway to escape. Ineos Grenadiers took over at the front of the peloton and the race settled down a little, but the reprieve was brief.</p><p>The break’s advantage was back to within 90 seconds on the lower slopes of the first-category Alto Collado Venta Luisa, the longest climb of the Vuelta. Feeling the peloton breathing down his neck, Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Victorious) accelerated away from his fellow escapees halfway up the 29.2 km mountain, and no one could follow.</p><p>Ineos continued to lead the group of favourites around two minutes behind Caruso – who started the day 6:47 down on GC after losing time in the crosswinds on stage 6 – until about 40 km to go when they stopped riding. With the peloton stalling, Geoffrey Bouchard (AG2R-Citroën) attacked from its flank and rode his way up to the small chasing group, where he spent the remainder of the stage stuck in no man’s land. Meanwhile, Jumbo-Visma assumed control of the peloton and let the gap stretch out.</p><p>By the foot of the final 13.1 km climb, Caruso’s gap was 3:18 over the chasers and 5:15 over the red jersey group. The GC battle further down the mountain swept up the chasers and cut a good chunk out of his advantage, but Caruso stayed away to take a well-earned stage win. Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) was second to cross the line a little over a minute later, with Enric Mas (Movistar) just behind in third, the only favourite who could stick with the race leader.</p><p>Roglič strengthened his lead on GC after weathering the repeated attacks on the final climb, and Mas moves up to second overall. Further down the standings, Mikel Landa (Bahrain-Victorious) all but dropped out of contention, finishing 5:04 behind his teammate, but Jack Haig’s leap up to fourth overall keeps Bahrain-Victorious in the GC race. Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) also seemed to struggle in the face of repeated attacks, some of them by his teammates. Even so, he only lost 1:05 to Roglič and remains the best-placed Ineos rider going into the first rest day.</p><div><div><p>La Vuelta ciclista a España (2.UWT) <span>Puerto-Lumbreras → Alto de Velefique</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/fd/damiano-caruso-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8f72de98ed955c2275b034925c3729dc7ce17622c42503f51d85c08d239903c9","category":"Cycling"}
