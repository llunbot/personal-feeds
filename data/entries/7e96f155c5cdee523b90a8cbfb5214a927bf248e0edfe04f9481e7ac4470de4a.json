No malicious versions were found in Play or Apple’s App Store. Last Monday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/20/google-flags-apps-made-by-popular-chinese-e-commerce-giant-as-malware/\">TechCrunch reported</a> that Pinduoduo was pulled from Play after Google discovered a malicious version of the app available elsewhere. TechCrunch reported the malicious apps available in third-party markets exploited several zero-days, vulnerabilities that are known or exploited before a vendor has a patch available.</p>\n<h2>Sophisticated attack</h2>\n<p>A preliminary analysis by Lookout found that at least two off-Play versions of Pinduoduo for Android exploited CVE-2023-20963, the tracking number for an Android vulnerability <a href=\"https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-03-01\">Google patched</a> in updates that became available to end users <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/critical-vulnerabilities-allow-some-android-phones-to-be-hacked/\">two weeks ago</a>. This privilege-escalation flaw, which was exploited prior to Google’s disclosure, allowed the app to perform operations with elevated privileges. The app used these privileges to download code from a developer-designated site and run it within a privileged environment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926914#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926914&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e96f155c5cdee523b90a8cbfb5214a927bf248e0edfe04f9481e7ac4470de4a","category":"Tech"}
