Individuals who hold the Terraform Associate 002 certification have shown they know the basic concepts, skills, and use cases associated with open source HashiCorp Terraform.</p>\n\n<p>HashiCorp Terraform as a product has evolved since 2020, while incremental updates to our exams have kept the content in the (002) exam relevant and accurate. However, our subject matter experts concluded that it was time to overhaul the exam’s organizational structure to align with the product’s current state and future growth. To learn more about what’s changed, navigate to the “Which exam to take” section of the new <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/certifications/infrastructure-automation#terraform-associate-(003)-details\">HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003)</a> page. There you will also find more details about the new exam, including how to sign up.</p>\n\n<h2>Timeline</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Today</strong>: The new <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate\">HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003)</a> exam is available!</p>\n\n<p><strong>May 5</strong>: Last day to schedule or cancel the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate-002\">HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (002)</a> exam. Exam appointments will be open until May 19, subject to availability.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Those studying for the older (002) exam should make note of these deadlines. If you fail or need to reschedule your exam after these dates, you will need to take the new (003) exam, which means studying new objectives.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Both credentials are valid until they expire</h2>\n\n<p>All unexpired HashiCorp Certified badges remain valid and relevant. The expiration date of a badge only proves validity, not which version someone holds. We encourage our community and their employers to treat both badges equally.</p>\n\n<p>HashiCorp will be issuing new credentials (badge and certificate) for the Terraform Associate 003 exam. If you already hold a (002) certification, there is no rush for you to pass the (003) version until your current badge expires. However, if you’d like to have both, you can take Terraform Associate 003 as soon as you are ready.</p>\n\n<h2>Start studying today</h2>\n\n<p>We’re excited to bring you the new HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) exam, and we have curated several resources to help you prepare.
