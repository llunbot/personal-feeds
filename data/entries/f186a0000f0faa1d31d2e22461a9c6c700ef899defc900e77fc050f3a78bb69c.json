This film, helmed by CG animation house Illumination (<em>Despicable Me</em>), still doesn't have a title or any preview footage. But it does have an English-language cast:</p>\n<ul><li>Chris Pratt (<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>) as Mario</li>\n<li>Anna Taylor-Joy (<em>The Queen's Gambit</em>) as Peach</li>\n<li>Charlie Day (<em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>) as Luigi</li>\n<li>Jack Black (<em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/jumanji-the-next-level-is-less-fresh-this-time-around-but-still-lots-of-fun/\">Jumanji</a></em>) as Bowser</li>\n<li>Keegan-Michael Key (<em>Key and Peele</em>) as Toad</li>\n<li>Kevin-Michael Richardson (<em>Teen Titans</em>) as Kamek</li>\n<li>Fred Armisen (<em>SNL</em>) as Cranky Kong</li>\n<li>Sebastian Maniscalco (<em>The Irishman</em>) as Foreman Spike (from the <em>Wrecking Crew</em> series)</li>\n</ul><p>None of Nintendo's other YouTube channels, particularly the Japanese feed, confirmed any voice cast members for the film's likely additional languages. Nintendo did confirm that Charles Martinet (who has voiced Super Mario in games since 1996) will participate in the film, though in exactly what capacity remains to be seen (er, heard). My money's on Waluigi.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797938#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797938&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f186a0000f0faa1d31d2e22461a9c6c700ef899defc900e77fc050f3a78bb69c","category":"Tech"}
