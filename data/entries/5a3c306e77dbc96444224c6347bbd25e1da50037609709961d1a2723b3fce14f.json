A new <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect&amp;xcust=1-1-2060811-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">report from Bloomberg</a> sheds some light on what to expect from Apple’s next lineup of wearables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Mark Gurman, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 will focus on “speed, efficiency, and accuracy” as Apple looks to bring a series of under-the-hood upgrades. He reports that Apple is planning to add a fourth-gen optical heart rate sensor, an upgrade from the third-gen sensor that was introduced with the Apple Watch Series 6. It’s unclear what specific improvements the third-gen sensor brought over the second-gen sensor, but the fourth-gen will be faster and more accurate, according to Gurman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will also reportedly include a new U2 chip in the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, an upgrade over the U1 chip. Gurman says the new chip will improve location abilities for more precise tracking in the Find My app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the new watches will showcase the all-new S9 processor, which will bring “major gains in processing speed” and possibly battery life improvements. And the Apple Watch Ultra 2 may have a second “dark titanium” color option. Apple will also reportedly use <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2049817/apple-watch-series-9-stainless-steel-chassis-3d-printing.html\">3D printing</a> for some models, though it’s unlikely Apple will talk about that during the presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will unveil the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Wonderlust event on Tuesday at 10am PT</a>. Follow along with Macworld for all of the announcements as they happen.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5a3c306e77dbc96444224c6347bbd25e1da50037609709961d1a2723b3fce14f","category":"Apple"}
