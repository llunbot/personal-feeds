One way to bridge that gap is building biohybrid robots that merge synthetic machinery with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/inflating-spider-corpse-creates-robotic-claw-game-of-nightmares/\">biological components</a> like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/07/robot-made-to-swim-using-light-activated-heart-muscle-cells/\">animal muscles</a>, bacteria, or plants.</p>\n<p>But living muscles are very hard to keep alive in a machine, bacteria have a very short lifespan, and plants tend to react to things a bit slowly, like Ents in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. So, a team of scientists at Cornell University went down a different path and built biohybrid robots controlled by fungi, specifically, oyster mushrooms.</p>\n<h2>Understanding mushroomsâ€™ signals</h2>\n<p>Robots controlled by fungi, despite giving strong <em>Last of Us</em> vibes, are a good idea on paper. Fungi are very easy to sustain and can live pretty much everywhere, including extreme environments like the Arctic, or even amid nuclear contamination. They're also cheap to culture in large quantities and excel at reacting to environmental cues like exposure to light.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049740#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049740&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d64f3d01d0536ff740eea38e6eb2883b4857e8b6c0a0a34155c65b142e6afeb","category":"Tech"}
