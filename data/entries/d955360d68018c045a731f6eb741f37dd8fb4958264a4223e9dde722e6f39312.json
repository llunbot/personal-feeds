The update would be compatible with all other models, including the Apple Watch Series 6 and beyond.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEven though the Series 5 has an S5 chip, it has the same processor as the S4 chip in the Series 4, so it would not be too surprising if Apple dropped support for these models simultaneously. Key changes with the Series 5 compared to the Series 4 included an always-on display option, increased storage, and a compass.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaker who revealed this information has a private account on X, so we have elected not to share its name or link to it, but they have shared accurate compatibility information and build numbers for Apple's software updates in the past.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe'll find out official watchOS compatibility details during the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-june-10/\">WWDC keynote</a> in just a few hours.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/watchos-11-compatibility-rumor/\">watchOS 11 Allegedly Drops Support for Apple Watch Series 4, Series 5, and Original SE</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-allegedly-drops-support-for-apple-watch-series-4-series-5-and-original-se.2428622/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d955360d68018c045a731f6eb741f37dd8fb4958264a4223e9dde722e6f39312","category":"Apple"}
