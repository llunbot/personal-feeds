It’s particularly reassuring to see new launches from Kona Bikes as the brand’s future seemed in jeopardy after <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/what-happened-to-kona-bikes-sea-otter/\" target=\"_blank\">their disappearing act at last year’s show</a>. It took about a month to work out the details, but it was announced later that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kona-buys-brand-back-from-kent-outdoors/\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Gerhard and Jake Heilbron had purchased the brand back from Kent Outdoors</a>, making Kona Rider Owned once again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, just under a year later, we’re seeing new bikes from Kona and how sweet it is! First up is the new Libre CR, the second generation of their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-kona-libre-dl-gravel-bike-has-some-interesting-geometry-and-it-works/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bike that I grew to love back in 2019</a>. For 2025, the Libre has been updated across the whole frame creating a modern, fast, gravel bike with plenty of versatility. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR seat post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-13-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR head tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-14-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR head tube badge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-20-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-05-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the previous gen, the new Libre CR (Carbon) features a carbon fiber frame.

The tire clearance is basically the same at 700c x 45mm, but the frame also clears 45mm tires with full coverage fenders thanks to the removable fender bridge. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR front derailleur mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-07-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-21-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR bottle mounts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-gravel-bike-review-06-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the complete bike ships as a 1x, front derailleurs are still an option thanks to a removable FD mount. Finally, the frame gets some updates to the cargo mounts. There are no longer any mounts on the fork legs except for fender mounts, and the second high bottle mount on the downtube is gone. However, there is now a three pack mount on the downtube which is place to work with the seat tube mount to allow for two bottles to be mounted underneath a half-frame bag. There’s also still a top tube mount for another small bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Geometry and Sizing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-Geometry.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1057\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-Geometry.png\" alt=\"Kona Libre Geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-Geometry.png 1057w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-Geometry-297x192.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-Geometry-120x77.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-Geometry-768x496.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-kona-libre-libre-dl-crush-gravel-road-and-everything-in-between/\" target=\"_blank\">original Libre CR </a>was a great bike, but the sizing was pretty wacky – at least on paper. I ended up on a 49cm frame, which rode way bigger than the number would imply. It was also offered in only five sizes. The new frame gets an additional sixth size, and the sizing numbers seem to be closer to the industry norm. This time, I’m on a 52cm frame, and it fits similar to the 49cm previously. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the changes in sizing, the geometry of the Libre has been tweaked to be a little more modern, and a littler faster. The Libre CR still has a tall head tube which is made taller by a large volcano spacer, but without very few spacers and the stem in a negative position, I was able to get comfortable. Elsewhere, you’ll find shorter chainstays, a slightly steeper seat angle, less stack, and a bit more reach. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Libre CR Build</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-build-kit.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1056\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-build-kit.png\" alt=\"Kona Libre build kit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-build-kit.png 1056w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-build-kit-297x180.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-build-kit-120x73.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-build-kit-768x465.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With only one build to choose from here, it’s not like you have a lot of options. Fortunately, it’s a solid build spec with a SRAM Apex AXS 1×12 drivetrain, Ritchey cockpit including a Butano Comp Internal bar, Easton ARC rims, and some of my favorite WTB Vulpine 45 tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Libre CR/DL Frameset (only)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2k25_libre_cr_dl_frame-1-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"878\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2k25_libre_cr_dl_frame-1-1536x878.webp\" alt=\"Kona LIber CR DL frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2k25_libre_cr_dl_frame-1-1536x878.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2k25_libre_cr_dl_frame-1-297x170.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2k25_libre_cr_dl_frame-1-120x69.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2k25_libre_cr_dl_frame-1-768x439.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2k25_libre_cr_dl_frame-1-2048x1171.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the Libre CR, Kona is also launching the CR/DL. In Kona parlance, DL typically means ‘Deluxe’. In this case, the CR/DL isn’t a build at all – this one is offered as a frameset only. Think of it as a deluxe build in that you get to choose every part of it. It’s also only offered in Yellow, while the Libre CR complete is only offered in Mauve. Otherwise, the frames are exactly the same. Kona is only offering one complete build for the Libre CR, so if you want something different the CR/DL is your canvas. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1406\" height=\"2500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review.webp\" alt=\"Kona Libre CR 2025 review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review.webp 1406w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review-169x300.webp 169w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review-67x120.webp 67w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review-768x1366.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review-864x1536.webp 864w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kona-Libre-CR-2025-review-1152x2048.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Straight out of the box, I was excited to get a chance to check out the new Libre CR ahead of time. The build was quick and easy, and it didn’t take long to get the cockpit setup dialed to my liking. I didn’t get a chance to weigh it before kitting it out, so I’ll update with the weight as soon as I strip it back down to the stock bike.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a bit of a false start when I went to shift the bike and nothing happened. I had already ensured the battery was charged and installed correctly. After inspection, I realized it’s possible to bump the battery in the derailleur so that it’s still mounted, but the battery isn’t making contact. I moved the battery slightly with my hand, and the shifting started working again. I tried this same thing on a bike with SRAM Force AXS, and the battery moved a bit, but it never lost connection. It seems like this may be an Apex-specific issue, or just a warranty issue. Either way, if you shifting isn’t working, try jiggling the battery first. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that out of the way, it was time for the first ride. Immediately, the bike felt fast. <em>Really</em> fast. I’m sure the fast tires helped with this feeling, but the frame has to play a part as well. To me, a big part of that speed was the smooth feeling transmitted through the frame. I’ve only had the bike for a week, so my riding has been limited, but I’m very excited to get out on the Libre more as Spring warms up, and Sea Otter is behind us!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Libre CR $3,599</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Libre CR/DL Frame with Kona Carbon Libre Fork $1,950</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://konaworld.com\" target=\"_blank\">konaworld.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/second-gen-kona-libre-gets-lighter-rides-better-adds-new-geo-udh/\">Second Gen Kona Libre Gets Lighter, Rides Better, Adds New Geo &amp; UDH</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ae85967ba9002a2afdac2d61ab27e45ea42c9a2bf1b863a4479d83f944273ed1","category":"Cycling"}
