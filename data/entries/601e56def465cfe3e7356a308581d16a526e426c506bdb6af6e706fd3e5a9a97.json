It will allegedly be included as part of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/\">Apple Design Resources</a> for iOS 18, which helps developers visually design apps using software like Sketch and Photoshop. We cannot attest to the authenticity of the image, but believe it is worth sharing because it is consistent with previous rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn February, Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em> claimed that iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/\">visionOS-inspired design elements</a>. The Vision Pro headset's OS features a high level of depth translucency with glass-like buttons that have reflective edges. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1012\" /><em>visionOS design elements.</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor example, the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will apparently feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/\">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> last year. The design of this menu has clear similarities to visionOS. Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>The Verifier</em> has a mixed track record with Apple rumors over the years, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman subsequently said that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/\">working to update the design of iOS</a> as \"early as this year.\" He agreed that iOS could take some design cues from visionOS going forward, but Gurman does not expect a \"total overhaul that mirrors visionOS.\" The extent of the potential redesign is therefore still unknown.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Gurman implied that the redesign may not emerge this year, he was more firm about iOS 18 being redesigned in a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-12/apple-aapl-plans-ambitious-ios-18-and-macos-15-updates-seeks-to-squash-bugs-lovjlsf6\">November edition</a> of his newsletter, when he said Apple's senior management had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/\">described iOS 18 as \"ambitious and compelling,\"</a> with \"major new features and designs.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe purported iOS 18 Camera app design resource seemingly lines up with these reports, showing a substantial rethinking of Apple's visual elements in line with visionOS, but it may not be legitimate. Apple is expected to preview iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC on June 10. The first beta should be available shortly after the announcement. The update should be released to all users in September alongside the iPhone 16 lineup.
