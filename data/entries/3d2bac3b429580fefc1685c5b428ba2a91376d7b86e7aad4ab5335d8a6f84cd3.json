{"title":"Brightest-ever gamma ray burst (the “BOAT”) continues to puzzle astronomers","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927599","date":1680204178000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>On October 9, 2022, Swift’s X-Ray Telescope captured the afterglow of the brightest gamma-ray burst ever recorded, called GRB 221009A. </p></div>\n<p>On the morning of October 9, 2022, multiple space-based detectors picked up a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-swift-fermi-missions-detect-exceptional-cosmic-blast\">powerful gamma-ray burst</a> (GRB) passing through our Solar System, sending astronomers around the world scrambling to train their telescopes on that part of the sky to collect vital data on the event and its aftermath. Dubbed GRB 221009A and deemed likely to be the \"birth cry\" of a new black hole, the gamma-ray burst is the most powerful yet recorded. That's why astronomers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/its-the-boat-astronomers-observe-brightest-of-all-time-gamma-ray-burst/\">nicknamed it the BOAT</a>, or Brightest Of All Time.</p>\n<p>The event was <a href=\"https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15650\">promptly published</a> in the Astronomer's Telegram, and we now have new data from follow-up observations in <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acbcd1\">several new papers</a> published in a special focus issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The findings confirmed that GRB 221009A was indeed the BOAT, appearing especially bright because its narrow jet was pointing directly at Earth. “It’s probably the brightest event to hit Earth since human civilization began,” Eric Burns, an astronomer at Louisiana State University, <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2366440-the-most-powerful-space-explosion-ever-seen-keeps-baffling-astronomers/\">told New Scientist</a>. “The energy of this thing is so extreme that if you took the entire sun and you converted all of it into pure energy, it still wouldn’t match this event. There’s just nothing comparable.” </p>\n<p>But the various analyses also yielded several surprising results that puzzle astronomers and may lead to a significant overhaul of our current models of gamma ray bursts. For instance, a supernova should have occurred a few weeks after the initial burst, but astronomers have yet to detect one. Radio data from observations of the afterglow didn't match predictions of existing models, and astronomers detected rare extended rings of X-ray light echoes from the initial blast in distant dust clouds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927599#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927599&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3d2bac3b429580fefc1685c5b428ba2a91376d7b86e7aad4ab5335d8a6f84cd3","category":"Tech"}
