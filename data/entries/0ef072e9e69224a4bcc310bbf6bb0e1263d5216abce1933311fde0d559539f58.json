From there, the options are Fast, Default, and Slow. Toggling on Fast speeds up â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ, and the duration can be tested using the image in the Settings app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a> and the first beta of â€ŒiOS 17â€Œ, options for â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ included Fast and Slow, with \"Fast\" previously being equivalent to the Default option in the new interface. The new Fast toggle is a step up in speed compared to the old Fast option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>New Fast Haptic Touch option in iOS 17 feels like 3D Touch! ðŸ¤© <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ios17?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ios17</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YDkViEVCpp\">pic.twitter.com/YDkViEVCpp</a></p>â€” Apple Intro (@AppleIntro) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleIntro/status/1671778695088943104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nSetting â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ to Fast makes a noticeable difference in how quick haptic menus pop up under the finger when an icon or on-screen element is long pressed. The speed brings â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ interactions closer to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3d-touch/\">3D Touch</a> interactions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs many <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users might remember, â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ was an interactive haptic feature that Apple introduced in 2015 with the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ 6s and used prior to the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ XR. With the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ XR in 2018, Apple transitioned away from â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ and instead implemented the simplified â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ. â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ supported multiple levels of pressure for different interactions depending on how hard you pressed, with Apple implementing \"Peek and Pop\" gestures. Comparatively, â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ supports just a single level of pressure for the long press gesture.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nâ€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ has always worked slower than â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ because of the two levels of pressure that â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ allowed for. The first â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ pressure level activated quickly when pressing on the display, so those who became used to â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ may have found the â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ replacement to be too sluggish. On Fast mode in â€ŒiOS 17â€Œ, â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ is quicker and feels more sensitive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's still not entirely clear why Apple got rid of â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ, but it has been speculated that Apple eliminated it in order to bring gesture parity to the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. â€Œ3D Touchâ€Œ was always an iPhone-only feature, but â€ŒHaptic Touchâ€Œ is available on both the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ and the â€ŒiPadâ€Œ.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/ios-17-haptic-touch-faster/\">Latest iOS 17 Beta Makes Haptic Touch Faster</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-ios-17-beta-makes-haptic-touch-faster.2393854/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ef072e9e69224a4bcc310bbf6bb0e1263d5216abce1933311fde0d559539f58","category":"Apple"}
