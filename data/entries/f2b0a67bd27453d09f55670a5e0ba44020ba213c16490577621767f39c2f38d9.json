And even though Prime Day is over, Amazon is still selling it for its lowest price ever: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9CJM1Z/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">You can get the 64GB iPad in silver for $250</a>, a savings of $79 and matching the best price we’ve ever seen for this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9th-gen iPad has a 10.2-inch display, A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage support. It’s the only remaining iPad to feature Apple’s classic design with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Home button but is still plenty capable for kids, students, and anyone else looking for a lightweight tablet for games, movies, and work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve only seen the 9th-gen iPad for this cheap a couple of times before, but it’s usually $279. So if you want one, now’s a great time to buy.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f2b0a67bd27453d09f55670a5e0ba44020ba213c16490577621767f39c2f38d9","category":"Apple"}
