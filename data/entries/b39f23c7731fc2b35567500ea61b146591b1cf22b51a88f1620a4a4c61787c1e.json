Ten hours later, on Tuesday morning, the game peaked at over 488,000 concurrent players, putting it behind only perennial favorites <em>Counter-Strike: GO</em> and <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/dota-2/\">Dota 2</a></em> on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/stats/\">Steam's list of most-played games</a> for the day.</p>\n<p>No, the idea of playing classic Capcom arcade games on the PC didn't get 27,000 times more popular literally overnight.

To get a game's full card set, a player has to purchase the remainder from the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market/\">Steam Community Market</a>. There, other players can offer their excess cards for sale, with commodity pricing determined by floating buy and sell offers that fluctuate based on supply and demand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817060#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817060&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b39f23c7731fc2b35567500ea61b146591b1cf22b51a88f1620a4a4c61787c1e","category":"Tech"}
