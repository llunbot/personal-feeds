Cook added that Apple still has more work to do in terms of renewable power and use of recycled materials to reach its environmental goals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen asked if \"we really need a new ‌iPhone‌ every year,\" Cook answered:<blockquote>I think having an iPhone every year for those people that want it is a great thing. And what we do is we allow people to trade in their phone. And so we then resell that phone if it's still working. And if it's not working, we've got ways of disassembling it and taking the materials to make a new iPhone out of.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe interviewer then asked what the ‌iPhone‌ will be like 20 or 30 years into the future:<blockquote>I think it'll be carbon neutral. I think obviously it will be way ahead of where it currently is, but I wouldn't want to give you all of our secrets in that regard. I'll just say from an environmental point of view, it'll be carbon neutral.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen asked what Cook does personally to help the environment, he responded:<blockquote>I do drive an electric car. I try to avoid plastics and plastic bottles. I recycle. I compost. All of these things I try to do, everything I do, I try my best to do something that has a lower carbon footprint.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSee the full interview video over on <em>Brut.</em>'s <a href=\"https://brut.media/in/science-and-technology/tim-cook-speaks-to-brut-bc5fd23c-d951-4a9c-850f-55951d24f303\">website</a> or <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@brutamerica/video/7287338638239747371\">TikTok</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/environmental-responsibility/\">Environmental Responsibility</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-environment/\">Apple Environment</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/cook-talks-iphone-future-and-more-in-new-interview/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Talks the Future of iPhone, Driving an EV, and More in New Interview</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-talks-the-future-of-iphone-driving-an-ev-and-more-in-new-interview.2406931/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88e8264299328ff9e0d6f0ba5cb03930468ac35388be2ced0fee7f1e9a4c081b","category":"Apple"}
