These details line up with previous rumors about the new MacBook Air from sources like <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and YouTube tech personality Jon Prosser.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/prosser-macbook-air-colors-stacked.jpg\" /><div><em>A colorful MacBook Air concept shared by Jon Prosser</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nKuo said the new MacBook Air will feature an \"all-new design\" with a similar form factor as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">the next MacBook Pro models</a>, which are also expected to feature a mini-LED display and flatter top and bottom edges. Previous rumors have suggested the new MacBook Air will also feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/next-macbook-air-faster-apple-silicon-chip/\">a faster Apple silicon chip</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/magsafe-finally-returning-to-macbook-air/\">MagSafe-branded magnetic power cable</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo said it is not yet certain whether the existing M1 MacBook Air will be discontinued after the mini-LED model enters mass production, and this could have an effect on pricing. If the M1 MacBook Air is discontinued, Kuo said the mini-LED model will probably start at the same $999 price. If the M1 MacBook Air does remain available for purchase alongside the mini-LED model, Kuo believes it could receive a price cut.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nChinese manufacturer BOE will supply the mini-LED displays for the new MacBook Air, whereas LG, Sharp, and Foxconn subsidiary GIS will supply mini-LED displays for the upcoming MacBook Pro models, according to Kuo. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple last updated the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tf-international-securities/\">TF International Securities</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/kuo-colorful-macbook-air-mid-2022/\">Kuo: Redesigned MacBook Air With Mini-LED Display and Several Color Options to Launch in Mid 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-redesigned-macbook-air-with-mini-led-display-and-several-color-options-to-launch-in-mid-2022.2307110/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6WzisCUYjP4:Tta1HqnDLoM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6WzisCUYjP4:Tta1HqnDLoM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6WzisCUYjP4\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e56b05b0a8e9c07838fe1f1a78d1b304d8248b1377420080f4c3fd55e01a30c","category":"Apple"}
