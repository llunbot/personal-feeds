These auctions will offer you the opportunity to own the most elite bikes. These bikes were used in some of the world’s most prestigious cycling events. The bikes include those that were ridden by Vingegaard, van Aert, Benal, Thomas, Bardet, de Gendt, Ganna, Powless, Carapaz, Costa, Vos, and more. Not only do these bikes come with a cycling celebrity tie in, but depending on the bike, you might actually land one for a deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Own-the-Ride-Pro-Bike-Auction-Jakobsen-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Own-the-Ride-Pro-Bike-Auction-Jakobsen-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Own the Ride Pro Bike Auction Jakobsen\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Own-the-Ride-Pro-Bike-Auction-Jakobsen-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Own-the-Ride-Pro-Bike-Auction-Jakobsen-297x153.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Own-the-Ride-Pro-Bike-Auction-Jakobsen-120x62.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Own-the-Ride-Pro-Bike-Auction-Jakobsen-768x395.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The auctions will feature bikes from many of the top riders.
