(credit: SpaceX)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>There has been a minor kerfuffle in the space community over the last few weeks about what to call the Inspiration4 mission that is set to launch this evening from Florida on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who paid for and will lead the three-day mission, preferred that it be deemed the \"world's first all-civilian spaceflight to orbit.\" But that's not actually accurate. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1436122397107707907\">According to</a> Harvard University's Jonathan McDowell, there have previously been 15 all-civilian orbital flights, beginning with the Soyuz TMA-3 mission in 2003. The most recent civilian flight was SpaceX's Crew-2 mission. The definition of \"civilian\" is \"a person not in the armed services.\"</p>\n\n<p>Technically, then, Inspiration4 is the first orbital spaceflight with an \"all private\" crew—people who are neither in the military nor professional astronauts for a civil space agency. But regardless of semantics, this mission is different.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795344#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795344&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32620ce2228ab73ff367a99baabaf3f39b162ead6393333830227eef68b38a6d","category":"Tech"}
