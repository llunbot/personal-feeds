It’s why we’ve basically never had a problem with anything we’ve tested from them, and why their racks often seem overbuilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also why they are (almost) the last major rack brand to enter the vertical hanging bike rack category. Come Fall, that’ll change with the new Thule ReVert Vertical Bike Rack. And it introduces a clever new feature to make it super easy to lift and lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1552\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1-1536x1552.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of thule revert hanging hitch bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1-1536x1552.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1-297x300.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1-768x776.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1-1520x1536.jpg 1520w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-1.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Available in 4-bike ($899) and 6-bike ($1,099), it’s off-road rated and carries up to 55 pounds per bike. For the 4-bike model, that’s a total of 220 pounds, and the rack itself weighs 73 pounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 6-bike rack has a maximum load of 250lbs, so if you have it fully loaded, your per-bike weight allowance will be a bit lower. Rack weight is 88lbs. For four bikes, though, the limit easily allows it to carry lightweight eMTBs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-5-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of thule revert hanging hitch bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-5-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-5-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-5.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The unique feature is the Dual TiltAssist Damper, which makes it extremely easy to lift and lower no matter how many bikes you have on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gas shock is so strong you’ll need to physically pull the rack down to lower it, where it’ll stay put while you access the back of your vehicle or load bikes. Then, just give it a nudge and it basically lifts itself up, even when fully loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-6-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of thule revert hanging hitch bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-6-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-6-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-6.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s operated with a large paddle lever near the top, so it’s easy to reach even if the rack is fully loaded.

They say some racks they tested ended up damaging the wheels on big bumps because the angle at which they’re held is too severe. But they needed a little bit of an angle to help the handlebars nest together.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-9.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-9-1536x569.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of thule revert hanging hitch bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-9-1536x569.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-9-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-9-120x44.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-9-768x284.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-ReVert-vertical-hanging-hitch-bike-rack-9.jpg 2025w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheels are held in place with thick rubber straps bolted into the cross bars.

Thule says it’s easy enough to be practical, but not so easy that someone can quickly unstrap and steal it…it takes just enough work to make it an unlikely victim of crimes of convenience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It covers two bike trays, so it’ll leave one bike spot open for your bike closest to the car on a three-bike rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-Santu-hitch-mounted-cargo-case-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-Santu-hitch-mounted-cargo-case-2-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"interior mounting details of the thule Santos hitch-mounted cargo case\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-Santu-hitch-mounted-cargo-case-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-Santu-hitch-mounted-cargo-case-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-Santu-hitch-mounted-cargo-case-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-Santu-hitch-mounted-cargo-case-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Thule-Santu-hitch-mounted-cargo-case-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The straps are bolted to the case from the inside, where you’ll also find tie-down straps to secure the cargo inside.
