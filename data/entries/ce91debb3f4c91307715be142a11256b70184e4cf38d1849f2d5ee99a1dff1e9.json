Launching later this year, the software update includes several new features, but not all of them are available on Intel-based Macs, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-green-brown.jpg\" alt width=\"2585\" height=\"1454\" />\r<br />\nOn the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/\">macOS Sonoma features page</a>, fine print indicates that the following features require a Mac with an Apple silicon chip:<ul><li>Presenter Overlay feature that displays the user on top of the content they are sharing in any video conferencing app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Game Mode, which prioritizes CPU and GPU performance while gaming by limiting the performance of background tasks.</li>\r<br />\n<li>A new high-performance mode in the Screen Sharing app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>The ability to pair Made for iPhone hearing devices directly with a Mac.</li>\r<br />\n<li>The ability to invoke Siri by saying \"Siri\" instead of \"Hey Siri.\"</li></ul>Apple does not indicate why the features are not available on Intel Macs, but it likely relates to performance considerations, and only Apple silicon Macs have a Neural Engine for machine learning tasks. The last Intel Macs were released in 2020, and Apple has since moved to its own custom-designed processors.
