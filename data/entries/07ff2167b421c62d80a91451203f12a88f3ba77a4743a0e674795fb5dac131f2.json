Most notably, the latest version of Final Cut Pro for the Mac includes spatial video editing support and AI-driven features such as Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, Pixelmator, the company behind popular photo and image editing apps Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator, announced that it is being <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/apple-acquires-pixelmator/\">acquired by Apple</a>. The apps are exclusive to Apple platforms with a focus on user experience and one-off purchasing, unlike many of their rivals. Pixelmator is designed to be a challenger to Adobe Photoshop, while Photomator is a Lightroom competitor. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro were Apple acquisitions, so it's possible that Pixelmator and Photomator may become the next Apple Pro apps with a focus on image editing. It could also fold some of their features into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app. While Apple used to offer a Lightroom competitor called Aperture, it discontinued the app just over a decade ago, and it has never made a Photoshop rival. What exactly Apple will do with the acquisition remains to be seen, but the Pixelmator team has teased \"exciting updates to come.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSee more of Kevin's work over on his YouTube
