Now, the new Panamera has gone into production, and we spent a day driving a pair of models on the road and track ahead of the car's arrival in the US this summer.</p>\n<p>Looks-wise, the third-gen Panamera closely resembles the outgoing model to the extent that it has the exact same exterior measurements: 198.8 inches (5,052 mm) long, 76.3 inches (1,937 mm) wide, and 56 inches (1,423 mm) tall.
