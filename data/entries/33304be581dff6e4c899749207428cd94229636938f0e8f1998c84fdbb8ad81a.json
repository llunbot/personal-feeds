The Alliance had previously sought to roll out the standard in the latter portion of this year, but it's now been delayed until 2022. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe group says that \"Matter\" is complete in regards to its feature set. However, according to the blog post, it still needs to continue working on the program in which developers can apply for certification and finish the SDK for developers to use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral smart home accessory makers have signed onto using Matter as a standard protocol, including Amazon, ASSA ABLOY, Comcast, Espressif Systems, Eve Systems, Google, Grundfos Holding A/S, Huawei, Infineon Technologies, LEEDARSON, Legrand, Nanoleaf, and others. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-google-amazon-delay-matter-launch/\">Apple, Google, and Amazon Delay Launch of 'Matter' Smart Home Standard Until 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-google-and-amazon-delay-launch-of-matter-smart-home-standard-until-2022.2307465/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E7N3D3WvSQY:BrgQ9yUpSrI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E7N3D3WvSQY:BrgQ9yUpSrI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/E7N3D3WvSQY\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"33304be581dff6e4c899749207428cd94229636938f0e8f1998c84fdbb8ad81a","category":"Apple"}
