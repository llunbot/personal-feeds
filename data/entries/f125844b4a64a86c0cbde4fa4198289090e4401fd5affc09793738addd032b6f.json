It's not just that it's dry. It's that all these conditions are happening at the same time,\" says Kaitlyn Weber, a data analyst at Climate Central, a nonprofit news group that published the <a href=\"https://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/uploads/general/FireWeatherReport2021.pdf\">analysis</a>. \"There's very clearly an increase in these fire weather days that's been happening since the early 1970s across most of the western United States.\"</p>\n<p>Weber analyzed data from 225 weather stations from 17 western states going back to 1973, looking at temperature, humidity, and wind speeds, the three main variables that drive catastrophic fires. High temperatures and low humidity suck the moisture out of vegetation to create dry fuels, so one spark easily ignites a wildfire, which swift winds can then push across a landscape <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/these-wind-patterns-explain-why-californias-wildfires-are-so-bad/\">with incredible speed</a>.
