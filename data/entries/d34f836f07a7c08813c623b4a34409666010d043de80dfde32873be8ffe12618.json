{"title":"Apple to Relax Anti-Steering Rules to Allow ‘Reader’ Apps to Link to Their Websites for Account Creation and Management","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/","date":1630543406000,"content":"\n<p>This is actually big news from Apple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple today announced an update coming to the App Store that\ncloses an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC).\nThe update will allow developers of “reader” apps to include an\nin-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an\naccount. While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will\napply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader\napps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions\nfor digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure a safe and seamless user experience, the App Store’s\nguidelines require developers to sell digital services and\nsubscriptions using Apple’s in-app payment system. Because\ndevelopers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and\nservices for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let\ndevelopers of these apps share a single link to their website to\nhelp users set up and manage their account. […]</p>\n\n<p>“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App\nStore is always to create a safe and secure experience for users,\nwhile helping them find and use great apps on the devices they\nlove,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App\nStore. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission\nand appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help\ndevelopers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and\nmanage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and\nmaintaining their trust.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Progress. Apple’s anti-steering provisions are <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement\">the number one thing</a> I have been clamoring to be changed in the App Store rules. I think this should expand beyond just “reader” apps, but one step at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of a <em>significant</em> amount of antitrust pressure being relieved from Apple. Netflix, Kindle, and Spotify (which has been a particularly vocal critic of Apple’s policies) can all do what they should have been allowed to do all along: link to their websites from their apps and tell users that’s where they need to go to sign up and buy content.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d34f836f07a7c08813c623b4a34409666010d043de80dfde32873be8ffe12618","category":"Tech"}
