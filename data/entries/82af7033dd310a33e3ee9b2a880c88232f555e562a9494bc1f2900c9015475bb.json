Apple has reportedly held discussions with companies <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/\">such as Google, OpenAI, and China's Baidu</a> about potential generative AI partnerships. iOS 18 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/\">not expected to include Apple's own ChatGPT-like chatbot</a>, but it is unclear if Gemini or other chatbot will be directly integrated into iOS 18.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is possible that Apple could offer some of its own cloud-based generative AI features in the future, as Apple supply chain analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu have said that the company is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/\">actively purchasing AI servers</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18 is rumored to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/\">new generative AI features</a> for the iPhone's Spotlight search tool, Siri, Safari, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more. Gurman previously reported that generative AI will improve Siri's ability to answer more complex questions, and allow the Messages app to auto-complete sentences.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil iOS 18 and other software updates at its annual developers conference WWDC, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/\">runs from June 10 through June 14</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/apples-first-ios-18-ai-features-no-cloud/\">Apple's First AI Features in iOS 18 Reportedly Won't Use Cloud Servers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-ai-features-in-ios-18-reportedly-wont-use-cloud-servers.2424167/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82af7033dd310a33e3ee9b2a880c88232f555e562a9494bc1f2900c9015475bb","category":"Apple"}
