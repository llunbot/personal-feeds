The tetraprism lens in the Pro Max model alone is expected to increase Largan's first half-year revenue by $108.8 to $121.6 million, according to Kuo. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo has repeatedly said he expects the tetraprism lens to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/\">expand</a> to both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max later this year, enabling at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom on the Telephoto lens of both premium models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a larger 6.3-inch display, compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro. This change would increase the overall size of the device, which would provide additional internal space for a tetraprism lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/both-iphone-16-pro-models-tetraprism-zoom-lens/\">report</a> by <em>The Elec</em>, Apple will add LG Innotek as another supplier of the folded zoom module used in the technology, in an attempt to secure production yields for the increased number of units required.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/iphone-15-pro-max-best-seller-early-2024/\">Kuo: iPhone 15 Pro Max to Remain Best-Selling Model in Early 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-15-pro-max-to-remain-best-selling-model-in-early-2024.2416372/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5bef0a23cef607127c75d330217d1699826d6aed8c18c46b0562e2cd80b7b84f","category":"Apple"}
