Read on below to find out what inspired this unique Trek 6000 build!<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8765.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Thought I’d submit my Readers Ride and current love thing</p>\n<p>It’s a 1991 Trek 6000 frame that is a little beaten up, but is super appealing to me visually. I’ve developed a total obsession with the ’80s and ’90s aesthetic in the last year or so..this is a total representation of my bike brain having a massive colour fart!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8820.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8814.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I spend my work life juggling a bike studio (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tailwindcyclery\" target=\"_blank\">Tailwind Cyclery</a> in Bristol, UK), photography, and mentoring young people. All are amazingly rewarding, creative and blend together beautifully. I get to educate and enthuse young kids in the joys of cycling and maintaining and building bicycles. Bristol also has a super active and supportive cycle scene.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8806.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8669.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I guess this is a typical bike shop owner kinda ride…there’s plenty of bike geek bling, reused components and a mish-mash of parts and ideas</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8649.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’ve swapped out the original rigid fork for a Surly model which had a near-identical axle to crown measurement, with the added benefits of multiple mounting points, disc brake, and thru-axle compatibility.<br />\nI have used a 650b front wheel and plan to rebuild the dynamo hub into a mullet setup when i can get hold of matching 650b/26″ rims.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8584.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Soma bars are literally a dream…the Paul Components choices are clearly ridiculous for a frame that is worth £30, but bikes are silly and I love them. Component choices are solid, fuss-free 1x with gear ratios that match the chilled ride pace that this bike is intended</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8624.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The frame bag was made by a local friend and bag maker ..a truly magnificent piece of work. The ability to stuff a few things within the frame triangle and not have it hinder the ride experience is really important to me…not a huge fan of dangly, swinging things!! I do attach a rack and basket to the front end when loads dictate but as pictured, even with my limited skills, wheelies are pretty easy!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8839.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Son Dynamo light is a luxury that adds another layer of practicality to what is otherwise a bit of a nonsense …but it makes me grin from ear to ear every time that I ride it.<br />\n26 ain’t dead…or rim brakes…or inner tubes. Do like a disc brake and tubeless though!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC_8763.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I adore this bike …oh, and the other ones.
