The company’s large carrier jet, called VMS Eve, will take off from a runway at Spaceport America in New Mexico and climb to an altitude of about 45,000 feet, where it will release the VSS Unity rocket plane to ignite its motor and start the climb to suborbital space.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950978#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950978&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"906d8eb32079099ca59269992905c5b0c5ae9adec82c49eff44c63b41dcfeeea","category":"Tech"}
