I recently spent more than $500 on a PlayStation 5, largely spurred by an opportunity to play and review <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003999/?_gl=1*9ppcmf*_gcl_au*NDMxMDkwMDMzLjE3MDg2MDk0MzY.\"><i>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</i></a> (releasing February 29), a title that activated youthful memories. This was a big mistake. Perhaps you can learn from it.</p>\n<p>None of this is particularly the fault of <i>Rebirth</i>. Even as I could only bring myself to put about 12 hours into it over the space of 11 days’ early access, I understood that those who truly cherish the original game, and still enjoy Japanese role-playing games (“JRPGs”) in general, will find a lot to love here. It’s a beautiful-looking game that runs smoothly on its quality-minded setting. The soundtrack is largely lovely, and I found myself humming the world map tunes while walking my dog or making coffee. Lots of things from the original that would be hard to wade through now, like random encounters and monotonous turn-based combat, have been transmuted into more tolerable forms here. The number of things you can do in this game, just from looking at screenshots of what’s ahead, looks like a true embarrassment of riches.</p>\n<p>I am sure that if I harbored stronger memories of the original game, had kept up a JRPG habit over the last 25 years or so, or perhaps had started with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/final-fantasy-vii-remake-spoiler-free-review-our-kind-of-cloud-gaming/\">the earlier <i>Remake</i> chapter</a>, I might have found more to grab onto in <i>Rebirth</i>. Most people aren’t going to gamble $70, let alone $500, plus dozens of hours, on the chance they’ll be magically transported to being 16 again, with the requisite free time and adolescent brain chemistry that helps one relate to a ragtag set of friends striving against cartoonishly oppressive villains.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005143#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005143&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"790fb956b18755c13077bb114f1934219dde217d3b80e4803f2da83d482ba70a","category":"Tech"}
