Inventors Que Anh S Nguyen and Christopher Jones describe a flexible display that can be rolled up from one or both sides in various scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen will be based on either OLED or micro-LED technology, with the LED printed on a flexible polymer base. In another variant, flexible glass is used for this purpose; the inventors envisage that the thickness of the glass coating on the inside will taper from the edge to the center, making the glass even more supple for rolling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While pundits remain fascinated by the folding tech available for the iPhone, this invention will not be limited to smartphones. The inventors also discuss its use in tablets and portable electronic devices, including a MacBook.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple patent for a rollable screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-rollable-phone-patent.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>USPTO</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The patent specification is relatively short, comprising just twelve pages, but it represents only one entry in an ongoing series of such applications. Only two days earlier, a patent called “Internal coating for glass structures in electronic devices” was approved, and one of the authors of this patent worked on that one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Que Anh S Nguyen is the lead author of at least 12 patents at Apple, all within the same realm of flexible and foldable displays. The earliest patent was approved by the USPTO in March 2017 and is titled “Transparent transition layer to maintain bendability from coated glass.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that, while patent activity often provides a glimpse into Apple’s future, it does not guarantee that such a product will definitely launch. Apple habitually undertakes research and patent activity in various directions, even if there are no immediate plans for a corresponding product line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/1995784/faltbares-iphone-apple-durchbruch.html&amp;xcust=1-1-1999412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Macwelt</a> and was translated and edited by David Price.</em></p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"18627aa7f45007aa028659901f913f5b9e2a106dbc68837a79b483a76eb11b74","category":"Apple"}
