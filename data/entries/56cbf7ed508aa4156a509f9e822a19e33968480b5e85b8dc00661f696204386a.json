When he was a graduate student in quantum computing at the University of Southern California, he got the idea while working on a project for a class on creativity and invention.</p>\n<p>“My initial goal was to create a version of quantum chess that was truly quantum in nature, so you get to play with the phenomenon,” <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/soon-we-can-all-join-paul-rudd-in-mastering-quantum-che-1756183601\">Cantwell told Gizmodo</a> back in 2016. “I didn’t want it to just be a game that taught people quantum mechanics.” By playing the game, the player slowly develops an intuitive sense of the rules governing the quantum realm. In fact, “I feel like I’ve come to more intuitively understand quantum phenomena myself, just by making the game,” he said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819918#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819918&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56cbf7ed508aa4156a509f9e822a19e33968480b5e85b8dc00661f696204386a","category":"Tech"}
