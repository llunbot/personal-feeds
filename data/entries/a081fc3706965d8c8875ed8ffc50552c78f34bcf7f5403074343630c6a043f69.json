Unlike most screen protectors available, the Rock Paper Pencil screen protector is magnetic, removable, and reusable. It snaps onto an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and can be removed when not needed for writing purposes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe screen protector has \"nano-texture technology\" that mimics the texture of paper and also cuts down on glare, while the ‌Apple Pencil‌ tip is made from metal and similar in design to a ballpoint pen tip. Astropad says that it is more precise than the ‌Apple Pencil‌, and it is able to screw right on to the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAstropad is selling the Rock Paper Pencil in two sizes, including 12.9-inch to fit third-generation and newer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models and 11-inch to fit the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Rock Paper Pencil kit can be <a href=\"https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil\">purchased from the Astropad website</a> for $31.99 at the current time, as there is a 20 percent launch discount available.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/astropad/\">Astropad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/astropad-rock-paper-pencil/\">Astropad Debuts Screen Protector and Apple Pencil Tip for a Realistic Paper Feel on iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/astropad-debuts-screen-protector-and-apple-pencil-tip-for-a-realistic-paper-feel-on-ipad.2399545/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a081fc3706965d8c8875ed8ffc50552c78f34bcf7f5403074343630c6a043f69","category":"Apple"}
