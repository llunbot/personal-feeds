According to Withings, the BeamO is the \"thermometer of the future,\" able to not only measure temperature, but also provide feedback on heart and lung health.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are electrodes along the side of the BeamO that allow it to detect blood oxygen levels and heart rate, while also performing a 1-lead ECG (similar to the Apple Watch ECG function).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA temperature scanner detects body temperature from the temporal artery, and with a Piezoelectric disc, it is able to capture chest or back acoustic soundwaves that can be provided to a physician during a telehealth appointment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWithings says that the BeamO can provide a body checkup in under a minute, alerting users to fever, infection, and possible cardiovascular issues like atrial fibrillation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeamO is set to launch in June 2024, and it will cost $250.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/withings/\">Withings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">CES 2024</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/ces-2024-withings-beamo/\">CES 2024: Withings Launches 'BeamO' Home Health Scanner</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-withings-launches-beamo-home-health-scanner.2415723/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d02c8d33e764279948074bfd1406248db76b988a7de96d46890ff76aa85b1d4f","category":"Apple"}
