WineHQ will be <a href=\"https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine-mono/mono\">the steward of the Mono Project upstream code</a>, while Microsoft will encourage Mono-based apps to migrate to its open source .NET framework.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.mono-project.com/\">Microsoft notes on the Mono Project homepage</a>, the last major release of Mono was in July 2019. Mono was \"a trailblazer for the .NET platform across many operating systems\" and was the first implementation of .NET on Android, iOS, Linux, and other operating systems.</p>\n<h2>Ximian, Novell, SUSE, Xamarin, Microsoftâ€”now Wine</h2>\n<p>Mono began as a project of Miguel de Icaza, co-creator of the GNOME desktop. De Icaza led Ximian (originally Helix Code), aiming to bring Microsoft's then-new .NET platform to Unix-like platforms. Ximian was acquired by Novell in 2003.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045805#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045805&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a36556583ca2d123a3f67f986f6c40c9b47eb3ff57831c7dbab665bc3f46361","category":"Tech"}
