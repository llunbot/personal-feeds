The notes reveal that iOS 17.3 allows the iPhone to connect to select hotel room TVs via AirPlay, but details remain slim for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\n\"AirPlay hotel support lets you stream content directly to the TV in your room in select hotels,\" the notes say for the iOS 17.3 Release Candidate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature allows iPhone users to scan a QR code on a supported hotel room TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing them to wirelessly stream videos, photos, and music from their iPhone to the TV. Google already offers a similar feature on some hotel TVs, allowing guests to stream content from their smartphone via Chromecast.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn June 2023, Apple said Holiday Inn parent company IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts planned to adopt the feature, but exact availability is unknown. LG previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/lg-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/\">announced</a> that it would be one of the first hotel room TV manufacturers to support the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple originally said the feature would launch last year, but it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-delays-airplay-in-hotel-rooms/\">delayed until 2024</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/ios-17-3-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/\">iOS 17.3 Allows iPhones to Connect to Some Hotel Room TVs via AirPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-allows-iphones-to-connect-to-some-hotel-room-tvs-via-airplay.2416617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7520e6c3f3217720692d20b37e413d17bb5597ffd751fb6cf06471157b8231e6","category":"Apple"}
