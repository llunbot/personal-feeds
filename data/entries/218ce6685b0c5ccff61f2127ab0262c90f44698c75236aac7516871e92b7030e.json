The move would help Apple bolster its Fitness+ subscription service, adding equipment to compliment the Apple Watch and its existing activity tracking software. Absorbing Peloton's three-million subscriber-base would ostensibly add about $1.7 billion to Apple's subscription revenue and line up with its continued investment in health and wellness, the company claims.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2022, Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-floated-as-potential-buyer-of-peloton/\">repeatedly floated</a> as a potential buyer of Peloton amid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/07/peloton-now-in-trouble-thanks-to-apple-fitness/\">financial difficulties and threats to its business model</a>, but the company's prospects have since improved somewhat and Deepwater Asset Management's new forecast is the first serious mention of the possibility in some time. Major questions remain about why Apple would want to take responsibility for Peloton's fragile business model and not simply focus on growing Fitness+, but anything is possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDeepwater Asset Management also believes that Apple will bring generative AI to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> this year, integrating its Ajax foundation model to a new version of ‌Siri‌ that is likely to be introduced at WWDC. The change should increase ‌Siri‌'s perzonalisation and natural conversation abilities. The hedge fund manager is also not expecting Apple to announce any additional Vision Pro products this year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/\">Peloton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/\">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year/\">Apple Could Acquire Peloton This Year, Fund Manager Forecast Suggests</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year-fund-manager-forecast-suggests.2415419/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"218ce6685b0c5ccff61f2127ab0262c90f44698c75236aac7516871e92b7030e","category":"Apple"}
