We just posted our overall Best of Show with input from the whole team, but this post will focus on <em>some</em> of my faves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I snapped a ton of photos per usual. But I also snapped a few neat random bikes while walking the show. This won’t be a tech article, just a fun post about some cool stuff. But, don’t worry, I will get to the techy new stuff as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-1536x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC Your dad..\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Your-dad-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>True statement….(Photos/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Zach, Jordan, and Tyler were here with me, so there will be all kinds o’ new bike bit coverage from those guys as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few fun photos of some random cool bikes and other stuff that interested me, including K-Edge’s cool trailer.

They hold a little real estate in my heart, and to this day I still bleed “blue and yellow”. So when I saw this bike stashed at the back of a booth, I had to grab a photo or two of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC ol' GT Ricochet side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-ol-GT-Ricochet-side-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC Ol' GT ricochet front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ol-GT-ricochet-front-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Restroom Ritchey</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC old school Ritchey\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-old-school-Ritchey-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a huge fan of Tom Ritchey and his designs. And this one is a stellar specimen. I’m guessing the owner was the guy sitting right next to it, or in the men’s restroom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick story: Along with Grant Petersen, Tom Ritchey is one of my biggest “bicycle industry heroes”. I met them both at Interbike once… I ran into Grant first, and then Tom. While snapping a selfie with Tom, I told him, “This is cool, I got to meet my two biggest heroes today, I just talked with Grant”. And Tom said, “That’s impossible, Grant never leaves the house.” Given Grant’s quirky personality, I thought it was pretty funny. Plus Tom feels like he’s seven and a half feet tall. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mint Merlin</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC Old Merlin\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Old-Merlin-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw this super clean Merlin being pushed around at the event and thought I’d ask the owner if I could get a photo of it. He obliged… they usually do, everyone likes to share their love of bicycles. I was in a hurry to an appointment, so it’s just the one photo. Enjoy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Ritchey Rando</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC Ritchey Rando full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Ritchey-Rando-full-bike-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Ritchey randonneuring frameset, the Montebello was at the Ritchey booth in all of its glory.

This was nice to see a lot more cargo-type bikes at the Sea Otter this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC Omnium Cargo bike tourer full shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-full-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC Omnium Cargo bike tourer message\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-message-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC Omnium Cargo bike tourer side back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-Omnium-Cargo-bike-tourer-side-back-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the needs of cyclists are changing, so is the expectation of what a bicycle can do.

Bringing their trailer was not only easier than using an Easy-Up for K-Edge to set up their displays, but it looks pretty pro-level displaying your goods out of such a fancy trailer. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC K-Edge trailer inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-inside-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC K-Edge trailer chips and salsa\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-chips-and-salsa-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuff I Liked at SOC K-Edge trailer display cases\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stuff-I-Liked-at-SOC-K-Edge-trailer-display-cases-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The trailer was built and put together as a labor of love by K-Edge owner Eric. And I’m here to tell you, he did an amazing job! I dug it and spent more time than I should’ve sharing stories and enjoying the chips, salsa, and beers – something that has become an anticipated Sea Otter tradition between us. Kudos guys! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Don’t worry SOC Officials, the trailer is on plywood, and the grass is fine. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.seaotterclassic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SeaOtterClassic.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rons-favorite-bikes-sights-sea-otter-2024/\">Ron’s Favorite Bikes &amp; Sights at Sea Otter 2024, Plus K-Edge Brought their Trailer!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"992f2a95884205f9c7b9b49a2a78a1deb6e0b77707d2d6397073d2c4f7fc82d3","category":"Cycling"}
