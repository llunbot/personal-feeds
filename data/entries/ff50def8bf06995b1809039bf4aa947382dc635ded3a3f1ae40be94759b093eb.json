Now, over 23 years after its release, <em>Perfect Dark</em> has gotten the full PC port it so richly deserves, complete with graphics and control updates that make the experience much more enjoyable for a modern audience.</p>\n<p>The \"work-in-progress\" port <a href=\"https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark\">from GitHub user fgsfdsfgs</a> is described as \"mostly functional,\" with \"minor graphics- and gameplay-related issues, and possibly occasional crashes.\" But those are a small price to pay for a version of the game that comes complete with full mouse-and-keyboard controls for the first time, alongside a 60 fps frame rate, support for modern widescreen monitor resolutions, and even the ability to load custom levels.</p>\n<p>After some quick testing, we can say this is easily the best way to play <em>Perfect Dark</em> today. The mouse-and-keyboard controls in particular make this version of the game stand out from <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/03/xbla-perfect-dark-a-golden-eye-for-detail/%E2%80%9D\">the quality 2010 Xbox 360 port</a>. And while the character models and level designs can feel a bit repetitive and blocky from a modern viewpoint, the added resolution and upscaling represent a big improvement over the muddiness of the N64 original (despite the improvements enabled by <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/twenty-years-later-i-still-remember-powering-the-n64-on-for-the-first-time/2/%E2%80%9D\">the then-massive 4MB RAM expansion pack</a>).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980942#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980942&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff50def8bf06995b1809039bf4aa947382dc635ded3a3f1ae40be94759b093eb","category":"Tech"}
