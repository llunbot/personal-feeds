That’s about to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally created as an offshoot of <a href=\"https://www.rimac-automobili.com\" target=\"_blank\">supercar brand Rimac</a>, Greyp has recently fallen into Porsche’s fold, which <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/porshce-fully-acquires-fazua/\" target=\"_blank\">also includes Fazua motors</a>, where there’s a big focus on electric mobility solutions beyond cars. The all-new Greyp Zaney is our first look at the next generation of the Croatian brand’s connected bikes, and it looks good.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"greyp zaney eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_integrated-motor-and-battery.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to be a lightweight yet capable trail bike, the Greyp Zaney uses Fazua’s Ride 60 drive system with a 430Wh battery. It puts out 60Nm of torque, putting it in that middle class between the 50Nm ultralight and the 85Nm full power bikes. But, it adds a special Boost Mode that adds an extra 100 Watts of power to the standard 450W output, giving you up to 12 seconds of super power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of greyp zaney e-mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greyp-zaney-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s controlled by Fazua’s minimalist Ring Control Hub and lets you move through the modes, and the companion app lets you fine tune motor output in each mode and save different rider profiles, which you can use for different trails or different users.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete.jpg\" alt=\"greyp zaney eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-new-Greyp-Zaney-carbon-lightweight-eMTB_150mm-ebike-powered-by-Fazua-Ride-60_complete-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives the bike a much more traditional layout, look, and feel than their original full suspension bikes.
