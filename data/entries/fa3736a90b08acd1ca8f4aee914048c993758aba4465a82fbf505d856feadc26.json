In the last five years, I’ve seen the world of running vests erupt and even start to bleed into the lightweight backpacking (fastpacking) world. Looking at this new generation of vests, my interest was finally piqued enough to take the plunge.</p>\n<p>Most cyclists are familiar with hydration packs. Camelbak-style backpacks were ubiquitous within the world of mountain biking until bike companies figured out that people actually wanted to store water bottles on their frames and made space for them, sometimes. Many people still lack proper storage on their bikes and turn to backpack-based bladder systems. While the sweaty-backed zealots among us may be enamored with their current backpack, I would argue that vest-style backpacks are strictly better in every way. The large chest straps wrap me in a warm embrace that is far more secure than any backpack I’ve ever worn. With the side adjustment straps, the bag does not flop around even in the rowdiest terrain. I could occasionally feel the slosh of a half-empty bladder, but there is no helping that. The vest sits high on my back, instead of occupying the majority of my back down to my hips, and thus does not require a waist belt to be secure. All of these factors add up to a more pleasurable experience while wearing a bag on my back.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-18.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-18.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-20.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-20.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Bikepacking Specific</h3>\n<p>In form and function, the Restrap vest is very similar to many other running vests on the market. The Restrap vest prioritizes snack and electronics organization on the chest straps over small water flasks that are popular on most running vests. There are a plethora of details present in this new wave of vests whose vernacular I am only cursorily fluent in, but the silhouette appears to be in line with what I expect from a running vest.</p>\n<p>I believe the Race Hydration Vest appeals to cyclists who don’t already have a vest-style pack. I haven’t spent enough time with other running vests to adequately compare Restrap’s offering to the far greater world of running vests, nor can I recommend it over another. Nonetheless, Restrap’s domestic production in the UK will surely appeal to certain riders.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-1.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-1.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pack Details</h3>\n<p>The Race Hydration Vest is sewn in-house at Restrap in Leeds, UK, to the high standards one would expect from a bag sewn domestically in the UK. The vest features a 5.5 liter longitudinally zippered main storage area, and while I’m no fan of waterproof zippers, I had no issues during my review period. On either side of the main zippered space are two mesh sleeves. I was able to fit two of our expedition bottles, one on each side, but I don’t think any larger diameter bottles would fit. This allowed me to start a trip comfortably hauling 4 liters (~1 gallon) of water on my back. The 2 L bladder is securely housed in a velcro-closed sleeve between the back panel and the main storage.</p>\n<p>The two chest straps sport stretch mesh pockets and one zippered pocket on the left strap. I found the zippered pocket to be handy for keeping my cellphone tucked away. There is also a handy key clip in the same zippered pocket. In the chest pockets, I generally kept snacks, sunscreen, headphones, or whatever small item I would want handy while riding each day. The chest adjustment is split between two straps, which can be positioned at various points on a daisy chain. The final adjustment is under the armpits in a triangular pattern, pulling the two sides of the pack together around the chest.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<p>I found the Race Hydration vest to be quite comfortable and had no issues with rubbing or chaffing on my rides. The vest never flopped around and was secure even when riding rowdy singletrack. The zippered main storage was easy to access and pack alike. The stretch mesh pockets held everything from AirPods to liter bottles with ease and never ejected anything. Being a desert dweller, I was happy to be able to easily double my water-carrying capacity without having to finagle bags onto my bike. I found myself hydrating more regularly due to the easy access to a bladder. I was likewise able to organize a lot of small pieces of gear that otherwise might just end up jangling around in my frame bag.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-2.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-2.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-7.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-7.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<p>I had the most issues with the bladder, unfortunately. Out of the box, the hydration hose leaked around the quick attachment point. I replaced it with another hose I had lying around, and this solved the issue. After a few rides, the attachment point at the top of the bladder cracked as well, which just made securing the bladder inside the backpack more complicated, but still functional. The main bladder never gave me any issues or leaked despite the very thin material.</p>\n<p>While there is an aesthetic of waterproofing with the zippers, I found my phone would develop condensation from my sweat while in the zippered pockets. I would believe the zipper would keep rainwater out, but the mesh padding fabric allowed moisture in from the back of the strap. I live in the desert and couldn’t care less about waterproofing personally, but I wouldn’t expect this bag to keep the elements out for long.</p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-13.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-13.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-13.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-13.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-13.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-13.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></h3>\n<h3>Multisport Allstar</h3>\n<p>There is a reason the running vest style is proliferating across the sports spectrum. It simply works well. I found the Race Hydration Vest to make a great day pack for hiking. The small but ample 7.5 liters of storage were enough for lunch and everything I needed for most long days of hiking. I did find myself cinching the bag higher on my back than I would while riding with the vest.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, I have really enjoyed the vest for use while rock climbing, where having such a secure hydration pack has been a game changer. I’m able to carry sandals for walking off if needed, snacks, plenty of water, and none of that interferes with my harness or other gear. I want to make a point that the vest can be used for multiple endeavors and transcends its more niche bikepacking use case.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already own a running vest – which is probable, since this is not a running website – I would check out the Race Hydration Vest from Restrap. It has many well-considered details and solid construction. From long, rowdy singletrack days in the sweltering sun to multiday bike touring adventures, I have grown fond of the Race Hydration Vest despite all my years of avoiding anything on my back.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-15.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Restrap_Race_Hydration_Vest_Review-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure storage with bikepacking in mind</li>\n<li>Adaptable to multiple forms of recreation</li>\n<li>Minimal color and branding</li>\n<li>Plenty of water storage up to ~4 liters</li>\n<li>Very comfortable even when overloaded</li>\n<li>Well-constructed and well-thought-out bag</li>\n<li>Sewn in the UK</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bladders are an easy fail point, and mine had minor issues</li>\n<li>Zippers can also fail</li>\n<li>Expensive, but in line with the high end of vest-style running packs</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/restrap-race-hydration-vest-long-term-review/\">Restrap Race Hydration Vest Long Term Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"fa3736a90b08acd1ca8f4aee914048c993758aba4465a82fbf505d856feadc26","category":"Cycling"}
