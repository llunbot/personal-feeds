{"title":"Apple Admits to BMW Wireless Charging Issue With iPhone 15 Lineup, Promises Fix Later This Year","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/","date":1698291351000,"content":"Apple today acknowledged a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/\">BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 series, and promised that it will make a fix available later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/BMW-Logo-iPhone-15-Pro.jpg\" width=\"1489\" height=\"744\" />\r<br />\nIn an internal memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers, Apple said charging an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max with a \"small number\" of wireless phone chargers built into certain recent BMW and Toyota Supra models may temporarily disable the NFC capabilities of the device. The memo does not provide a specific reason for the issue, which we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/\">first reported earlier this month</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an iPhone, the NFC chip powers features like Apple Pay and digital car keys. Users affected by this issue may receive a \"Could Not Set Up Apple Pay\" error message in the Wallet app, even if they have already set up Apple Pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Error.jpg\" width=\"1179\" height=\"658\" />\r<br />\nApple said the issue will be addressed in a software update coming later this year. Given the memo was put out hours after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-ios-17-1/\">iOS 17.1 was released</a> today, it appears the update will require a subsequent update, such as iOS 17.1.1 or iOS 17.2. In the meantime, Apple advises affected customers to stop using in-car wireless charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are some complaints about this issue across the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-apple-pay-issue-bmw-related.2404307/\">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeeSoS3xy/status/1707882090107465845\">X</a>, formerly known as Twitter, but it is unclear how widespread the problem is. Affected customers said the iPhone goes into a data recovery mode with a white screen, and the NFC chip is no longer functional after the device reboots. There is no way for customers to fix the problem, so a trip to an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says technicians can attempt to restart the NFC chip in an affected iPhone by using a software tool part of Apple Service Toolkit 2. If this step does not resolve the issue, Apple advises technicians to initiate a hardware repair.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo book a service appointment, visit the <a href=\"https://getsupport.apple.com/\">Get Support page on Apple's website</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bmw/\">BMW</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/\">Apple Admits to BMW Wireless Charging Issue With iPhone 15 Lineup, Promises Fix Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-admits-to-bmw-wireless-charging-issue-with-iphone-15-lineup-promises-fix-later-this-year.2408704/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"08b0021612f48ef189df4fea8b8f477dc9ff8810d8690e3880fc675e4bfa73fc","category":"Apple"}
