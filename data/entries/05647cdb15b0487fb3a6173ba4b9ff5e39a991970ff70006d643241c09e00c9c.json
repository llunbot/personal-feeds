That’s well worth the $249 MSRP, but even better when you can get them for $80 off: Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">Amazon is selling the AirPods Pro 2 for $169 right now</a>, the lowest price we’ve seen since Black Friday and just $10 off their all-time-low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We fell in love with the AirPods Pro 2 when we reviewed them, giving these a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2-review-2.html\">4.5-star rating</a> for their fantastic audio quality, great noise canceling, and solid battery life. These earbuds feature Apple’s H2 chip, which enables a cool feature called Adaptive Transparency, which automatically adjusts the noise cancellation to block loud noises and white noise while still letting some sounds in, like incoming traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On the outside, not much has changed with these second-generation AirPods Pro. But the sound quality has improved a lot, noise cancelling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par,” reads our review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The buds are also super easy to pair with Apple devices and you can seamlessly switch between them. They also come with hands-free access to Siri, allowing you to issue voice commands. If you want to exercise while wearing the AirPods Pro 2, you can definitely do that because they come with water and sweat resistance. And Apple’s new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2498966/your-airpods-pro-2-can-now-work-as-a-hearing-aid-heres-how.html\">Hearing Protection feature</a> lets you test your hearing and use the AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid with just a few taps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While $169 may not be the lowest price we’ve ever seen the AirPods Pro 2 available for, it’s the best we’ve seen outside of Black Friday. So go ahead and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">grab a pair at Amazon</a> before the price shoots back up.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"05647cdb15b0487fb3a6173ba4b9ff5e39a991970ff70006d643241c09e00c9c","category":"Apple"}
