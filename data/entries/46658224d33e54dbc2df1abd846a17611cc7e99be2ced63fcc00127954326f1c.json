But it's also bespoke Raspberry Pi hardware, in <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/\">Yellow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/green/\">Green</a>. It's entirely free, but it also receives funding through a private cloud services company, <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa</a>. It <a href=\"https://esphome.io/\">contains tiny board project ESPHome</a> and other inter-connected bits. It has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/can-you-manage-your-house-with-a-local-no-cloud-voice-assistant-mostly-yes/\">wide-ranging voice assistant ambitions</a>, but it doesn't want to be Alexa or Google Assistant. Home Assistant is a lot.</p>\n<p>After an announcement this weekend, however, Home Assistant's shape is a bit easier to draw out. All of the project's ambitions now fall under the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that now contains Home Assistant and more than 240 related bits. Its mission statement is refreshing, and refreshingly honest about the state of modern open source projects.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019041#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019041&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"46658224d33e54dbc2df1abd846a17611cc7e99be2ced63fcc00127954326f1c","category":"Tech"}
