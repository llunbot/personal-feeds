Apparently, there’s a serious bug with it in iOS 17.6, because Apple has just released an iOS/iPadOS 17.6.1 update that specifically addresses a problem with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release notes simply state:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This update includes important bug fixes and addresses an issue that prevents enabling or disabling Advanced Data Protection.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no explanations about what other bugs may be fixed, but if Apple is calling out the Advanced Data Protection issue, that’s easily the most significant one. Apple also released iOS/iPadOS 16.7.10, macOS Sonoma 14.6.1, and macOS Ventura 13.6.9 with the same fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\">Apple’s security updates page</a> says “This update has no published CVE entries.” That does not mean there are no security patches in the update, only that any fixes that exist were for issues not published in the <a href=\"https://www.cve.org\">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are running iOS 17.6, you should update to this version immediately.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a9c4d9600d09fcc96617e5dfd7451dc748d8262f11fca597427668ad30936681","category":"Apple"}
