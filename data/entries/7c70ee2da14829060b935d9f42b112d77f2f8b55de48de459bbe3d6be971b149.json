For many a cyclist, they’re best known for robust, high-quality bike racks that balance ease of use with smart features. Now comes the Thule Epos rack that throws just about every feature one could think of for a bike rack.</span></p>\n<p><span>And they really mean it. Thule says the Epos offers E-bike compatibility, a slick folding mechanism that makes it easy to tuck the rack away, and the ability to add brake lights, foldable loading ramps, and more.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thule-Epos-rear-bike-rack-installed.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1500\" height=\"815\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thule-Epos-rear-bike-rack-installed.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thule-Epos-rear-bike-rack-installed.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Epos is designed to hold either two or three bikes depending on which configuration you purchase.

Rather than the platform – where your wheels sit in a traditional hitch rack – folding up to the back of your car, the Epos platform effectively folds in half. Thule says that doing so allows for your car’s trunk to remain accessible.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thule-Epos-rear-bike-rack-closed-and-ramp.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thule-Epos-rear-bike-rack-closed-and-ramp.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thule-Epos-rear-bike-rack-closed-and-ramp.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>The Epos rack open, folded, and the optional ramp for heavy bikes.
