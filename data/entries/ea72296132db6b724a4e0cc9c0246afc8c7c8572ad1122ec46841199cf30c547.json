He says he pitched the app to Delta management, who, after allegedly expressing interest, ultimately turned him down before releasing a similar app of its own.</p>\n<p>Alexander says he worked on the project on his own time and spent $100,000 of his own money to create the app. He says he had several meetings with Delta about the app in 2015 and 2016 in which executives allegedly showed interest in acquiring the software. After 2016, though, Delta stopped communicating with Alexander about the app, and in April 2018, the airline released its own app, called Flight Family Communications.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780885#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780885&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ea72296132db6b724a4e0cc9c0246afc8c7c8572ad1122ec46841199cf30c547","category":"Tech"}
