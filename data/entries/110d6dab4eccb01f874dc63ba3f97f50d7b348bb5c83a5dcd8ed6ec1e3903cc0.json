But fans hoping for confirmation of rumored cameos from Spider-Man actors of the past were once again disappointed.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for  2019's <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>In 2019's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/spider-man-far-from-home-film-review-far-from-necessary/\"><em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em></a>, Peter Parker (Holland) was grieving the loss of his mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who perished in the final battle against Thanos in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/avengers-endgame-is-three-of-marvels-best-films-rolled-into-one/\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a>. What better than a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Far_From_Home\">summer field trip to Europe</a> to help him process his grief? Then Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) showed up and enlisted Spider-Man's help in battling a series of Elementals. Peter thought he'd found a new mentor in Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). But Beck had his own agenda and betrayed Peter. The two battled it out, and Beck was killed. But he got his revenge by sending doctored footage of the climactic battle to Jonah Jameson at The Daily Bugle. Not only did Mysterio's footage frame Spider-Man for his death, but it also revealed Peter's secret identity as Spider-Man to the world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813602#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813602&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"110d6dab4eccb01f874dc63ba3f97f50d7b348bb5c83a5dcd8ed6ec1e3903cc0","category":"Tech"}
