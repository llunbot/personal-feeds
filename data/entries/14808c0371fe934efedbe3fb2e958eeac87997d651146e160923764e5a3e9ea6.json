We named them a top inexpensive pick in a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/11/best-black-friday-headphone-deals-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">recent guide to wireless noise-canceling headphones</a> at their normal going rate of $80, but today, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GlGLJM\" target=\"_blank\">the Q30 is <strong>down to $60</strong></a> as part of an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3EBnW52\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon \"Deal of the Day\" promotion</a>.</p>\n<p>This is technically $10 higher than the <a href=\"https://keepa.com/#!product/1-B08HMWZBXC\" target=\"_blank\">lowest price</a> we've seen, but that cut lasted less than a day, and this price matches the best price we've seen outside of that sale. Because this is a Deal of the Day promo, the offer will likely only be available through Wednesday.</p>\n<p>As for the headphones themselves, the Soundcore Life Q30s aren't as effective at neutralizing outside sounds as our top picks like Sony's WH-1000XM4 or Apple's AirPods Max, but that's to be expected. For significantly less cash, we found the Q30s to be effective <em>enough</em> at tuning out low-end rumbles, like plane and train engines, and capable of providing at least some resistance to higher-pitched sounds as well. They're not world-beating, but they're solid, which is more than we can say for most over-ear pairs we've used in this price range.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818841#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818841&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14808c0371fe934efedbe3fb2e958eeac87997d651146e160923764e5a3e9ea6","category":"Tech"}
