{"title":"Why the Hardknott Pass is the hardest climb in England","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hardknott-pass","date":1693826946000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hardknott-pass\">Why the Hardknott Pass is the hardest climb in England</a></p>\n\n<p>There are precious few scenarios in which a cyclist can expect a round of applause from the driver stuck behind, but an ascent of Hardknott Pass is one of them. Make no mistake, this is an absurd climb. Tackling the stabbing 33% hairpins is testing enough in a car, so grinding up on two wheels (or possibly just one if sufficient weight is not kept on the bars) definitely warrants some acclaim from any onlookers, even if their clutch is about to burst into flames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One has to admire the audacity of the Romans, who at some point in history looked up at the rocky crags disappearing into the thick grey clouds above and decided this would be a perfectly sensible place for a road. Built circa 100AD, the original pass crumbled into disrepair long ago, but its successor follows a similar course through the wild and windswept Lakeland landscape. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lakes-of-fire\">Lakes of fire: Lake District UK ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-100-classic-climbs-10-4\">Cyclist 100 Classic Climbs: 10 – 4</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 143: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Still, it’s hard not to curse them and their piece of gravity-defying infrastructure while fumbling with the shifters, hoping that somehow an additional sprocket has magically manifested itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Second World War, Hardknott was used for tank training, its already weather-beaten surface pummelled to pieces by steel caterpillar tracks and heavy artillery. Despite having been resurfaced, the ground here is still a far cry from the silky smooth tarmac of your average Alpine climb. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Hardknott Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The famous (and, if we’re honest, fading) phone box marks the start of the Hardknott ascent.</figcaption><figcaption>Andrew Grant / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Potholes aplenty must be swerved and dodged to be in with a chance of reaching the summit. It’s just one more quirk that has earned Hardknott Pass a place in the running for toughest climb in the UK, vying for top spot with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bealach-na-ba\" target=\"_blank\">Bealach na Bà</a> in the Highlands of Scotland.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making the grade</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Hardknott Pass is not the steepest road in the UK. That is an honour it must share with Rosedale Chimney Bank in the North York Moors. It is, however, the most outrageous. This is not an official title, but it’s one few would argue with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclists from the Continent will no doubt scoff when informed that England’s most difficult climb is a measly 2.2km in length. But get them pedalling up it and they won’t be laughing for long. With an average gradient of 13%, including a series of impossibly tight bends that touch 33% in places, this relatively short section of mountain road leaves even the most iconic climbs of the Tour and the Giro looking and feeling pancake-flat.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Hardknott Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The 1km stretch before the trio of hairpins is flat(ish) – but it’s all relative.</figcaption><figcaption>Andrew Grant / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Snaking through the Esk Valley, between Eskdale and Little Langdale, Hardknott Pass and neighbouring Wrynose Pass provide the most direct route from the Central Lakes to the Western Lakes. Poetically described by former National Hill Climb Champion Tejvan Pettinger as ‘the king and queen of UK climbs’, both are often taken on in one go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the case in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fred-whitton-challenge-advice\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Whitton Challenge</a>, where plucky riders must overcome them after having ridden 150km and 154km respectively. It is understandably the bit that participants fear most.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For cyclists, Hardknott is most commonly climbed from west to east, towards Wrynose Pass. Tackling it from the east makes for a shorter but similarly leg-sapping experience with only slightly less savage gradients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savouring the last bit of flat ground on the approach from Eskdale is made difficult by the unavoidable presence of the pass looming on the horizon, and once past the famous red phone box on the left there’s no turning back.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Hardknott Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The final hairpins are so steep and light it’s a challenge to keep the front wheel on the ground and the rear wheel from spinning.</figcaption><figcaption>Andrew Grant / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The ascent starts abruptly at 20%, with a cattle grid thrown in just to add extra spice, like a ghost chilli garnish on top of a vindaloo. After rattling over that and out of the trees, the gradient remains consistently steep for another 500m as the road twists and turns through a series of nasty bends. They’re tough on the legs by any standards, but even they pale in comparison to what lies ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From here, the road ‘mellows out’ for a kilometre. The gradients are still in double figures, but the ride feels almost flat relative to the previous section. This presents a momentary opportunity to look away from the worryingly purple elevation profile displayed on your head unit to focus on the scenery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road flows through the valley like a black river in suspended animation. Towering green and golden fells flank it on either side, interrupted only by scattered rocky outcrops and the occasional free-range sheep (watch out for those on the way down).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Hardknott Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Hard Knott fell (but we didn’t)</figcaption><figcaption>Andrew Grant / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As the road straightens out, the real challenge comes into sharp focus. Snaking its way up the side of the eponymous Hard Knott fell, the pass proper is revealed in all its ominous glory. The summit is in sight, but the almost vertical-looking switchbacks preceding it make it feel a very long way off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t stop now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next kilometre is a serious test for even the most hardened cyclist. There are three aggressive hairpins that start the moment the elevation ramps back up. Each one is steeper than the last, with no room to breathe in between them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the corners for which Hardknott has become infamous. To dismount here is to admit defeat, as generating the forward momentum necessary to clip back in is almost impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Climbing through the twists is a delicate balancing act in more ways than one. First, there has to be sufficient speed to keep the bike from toppling over sideways. Then there’s the matter of keeping the front wheel on the ground. If your weight is too far back, it will begin to lift up in an unintentional wheelie. If the weight is too far forward, the rear wheel will lose traction and slip with each pedal stroke.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Hardknott Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/classic-climb-hardknott-pass-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Andrew Grant / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s no spinning here. Even with a real bin lid of a sprocket it’s still a case of getting out of the saddle and grinding. If you can get up this, you can get up anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hairpin madness over, the road straightens out once more and the gradient lets up, but only slightly. It’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that’s it, but the reality is there’s still a 500m stretch to go with sections over 12%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The words ‘A Good Effort’ (understatement of the year) are written on the tarmac as the top appears. One final push and the road levels out. There are a few metres of flat from which to savour the moment before lurching into the bone-rattling descent down the east face. Right, onwards to Wrynose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 143 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hardknott-pass\">Why the Hardknott Pass is the hardest climb in England</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9c4b251663cac2830f7c2dffa53a9501d178dcbf3f9f74fd33ddb92b5d806e2c","category":"Cycling"}
