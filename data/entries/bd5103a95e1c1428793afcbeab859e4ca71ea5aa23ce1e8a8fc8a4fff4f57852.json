Today we’re sharing the Daily Hook, a cargo buckle that utilizes an inner tube to make for a universal strap. Use it for commuting, touring, or even around your home. Anywhere you’d normally use a cargo strap. Fair sells the Daily Hook either as a complete strap from a re-used inner tube (CHF 64) or just a pair of buckles (CHF 58) – VAT included.
