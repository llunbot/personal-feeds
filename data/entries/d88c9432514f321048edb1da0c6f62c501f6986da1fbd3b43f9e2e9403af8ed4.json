All three of these iPhone models are still\nequipped with a Lightning port for wired charging.</p>\n\n<p>In a paywalled report today, the website said the iPhone models\nwill no longer be sold through Apple’s online store and retail\nstores in the European Union as of December 28, which is when the\nregulation goes into force.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was never clear to me whether this regulation only applied to new devices, or to existing ones. But I guess it applies to existing ones. Until the expected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/iphone-se-4-camera-details-revealed/\">next-gen iPhone SE ships early next year</a>, the lowest-priced new iPhone in the EU will be the iPhone 15, which starts at $700 in the U.S. and around €860 in Europe. (Apple’s prices vary slightly <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/choose-country-region/\">between EU countries</a> — and the higher prices compared the U.S. largely stem from VAT.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/igeneration-lightning-iphones-eu\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d88c9432514f321048edb1da0c6f62c501f6986da1fbd3b43f9e2e9403af8ed4","category":"Tech"}
