In contrast, Dickson's images show the numbers, which could potentially allow for other parts to be more easily identified and confirmed as legitimate if further leaked components emerge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors suggest the headset will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/apple-mixed-reality-headset-features-report/\">two to three displays</a>. There will be two high-resolution <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/apple-vr-headset-3000ppi-micro-oled-display/\">4K micro OLED displays</a> with up to 3,000 pixels per inch, for an 8K total resolution. Sony is expected to supply the display modules that Apple will use, though Apple may also use some OLED displays from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-asks-samsung-micro-led-ar-headset/\">Samsung</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicro OLED displays are said to be built directly on to chip wafers rather than a glass substrate, which results in displays that are thinner, smaller, and more power efficient.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/headset-ribbon-part-sonny.jpeg\" alt width=\"1290\" height=\"787\" />\r<br />\nMeanwhile an outward-facing display will allegedly be able to show the facial expressions of the headset's wearer to the people around them, to cut down on the sense of isolation felt when using the device. The display will have an ultra-low refresh rate and reduced power consumption to keep it from draining battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple reportedly showcased the mixed-reality headset to the company's top 100 executives in the Steve Jobs Theater <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-demoed-headset-in-the-steve-jobs-theater/\">last week</a>. Apple is expected to launch the headset later in the year, sometime after its debut at WWDC. Mass production of the headset is already underway, but some Apple employees are said to be concerned about the usefulness and price point of the headset, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-employees-concerned-about-headset/\">according to one report</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonnydickson-com/\">Sonny Dickson</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/apple-mixed-reality-headset-parts-leaked/\">Leaked Apple Mixed Reality Headset Parts Outline Goggle Enclosure in More Detail</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaked-apple-mixed-reality-headset-parts-outline-goggle-enclosure-in-more-detail.2385320/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"accafc48bba6b00ab8da1ea82206930a7d2f5ad1b7981f58a9e4f0b280722590","category":"Apple"}
