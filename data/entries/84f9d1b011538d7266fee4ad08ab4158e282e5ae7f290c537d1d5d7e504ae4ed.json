The attack worked because the service delivered updates over HTTP, a protocol vulnerable to attacks that corrupt or tamper with data as it travels over the Internet.</p>\n<p>The unknown hackers, who may have ties to the North Korean government, pulled off this feat by performing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">man-in-the-middle (MiitM) attack</a> that replaced the genuine update with a file that installed an advanced backdoor instead, said researchers from security firm Avast <a href=\"https://decoded.avast.io/janrubin/guptiminer-hijacking-antivirus-updates-for-distributing-backdoors-and-casual-mining/\">today</a>.</p>\n<p>eScan, an AV service headquartered in India, has delivered updates over HTTP since at least 2019, Avast researchers reported. This protocol presented a valuable opportunity for installing the malware, which is tracked in security circles under the name GuptiMiner.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019398#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019398&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"84f9d1b011538d7266fee4ad08ab4158e282e5ae7f290c537d1d5d7e504ae4ed","category":"Tech"}
