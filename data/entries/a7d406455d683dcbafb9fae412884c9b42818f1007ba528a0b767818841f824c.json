Options for 360º footage using both lenses are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>8K30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5.7K60</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4K100</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2.7K120</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, switch it to single lens mode and it goes to 4K60 for standard action camera footage. Need subject tracking? The “ME” mode shoots 360º in 4K but saves the footage pre-framed with the selected subject centered in the frame, whether it’s “me”, you, or someone/thing else.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"insta360 x4 shown on a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-chest-mount.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-bike-mounts.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-bike-mounts-1536x601.jpg\" alt=\"insta360 x4 shown on road and mountain bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-bike-mounts-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-bike-mounts-297x116.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-bike-mounts-120x47.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-bike-mounts-768x300.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/insta360-x4-bike-mounts.jpg 2025w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For cyclists, single-lens mode works great on chest mounts, or use their out-front pole mount for wild road bike footage. Stick it upright on a helmet mount for full pan footage and a bird’s eye view. FlowState stabilization and 360º Horizon Lock keep your footage steady, level, and shake-free no matter what you’re getting into.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The X4 keeps its voice control feature, but adds Bluetooth headset compatibility for remote voice control or pairing with mics inside a full face/moto helmet. The new AI-enabled chip adds gesture control, too, letting you make hand signals to start or stop recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their desktop app has been upgraded and comes free with the camera, making it easy to edit and frame your 360º footage on the big screen. But some real magic comes with app. Pair the camera with your smartphone and you can frame your 360º footage into a standard horizontal or vertical rectangle view simply by aiming your phone as the video plays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, a new, larger battery provides up to 135 minutes of recording per charge in 5.7K30 mode. A 2.5″ screen makes it easier to see what you’re shooting and all of your mode settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP starts at $499, with bundles available to add mounts, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-x4\" target=\"_blank\">Insta360.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/insta360-x4-brings-8k-360o-action-cam-footage/\">Insta360 X4 brings 8K 360º Action Cam Footage</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a7d406455d683dcbafb9fae412884c9b42818f1007ba528a0b767818841f824c","category":"Cycling"}
