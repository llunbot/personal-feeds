The keyboard is priced at $139, with an ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ version coming in mid-March and a $159 ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max version set to release in the spring.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Clicks Creator Keyboard is available in \"BumbleBee\" yellow and \"London Sky\" gray, and it adds a small physical keyboard to the bottom of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. Clicks says that the case design is meant to \"feel like a natural extension\" of the ‌iPhone‌, and the keys have been designed for ideal click resistance and feedback for fast and accurate typing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-3.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" />\r<br />\nThe standard QWERTY keyboard features keys for activating dictation, accessing emoji, and activating shortcuts like returning to the Home screen and scrolling. At night, a built-in backlight can be turned on.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn ‌iPhone‌ connects to the keyboard via Lightning (‌iPhone 14‌ Pro) or USB-C (‌iPhone 15 Pro‌), and passthrough charging is supported. The case also supports wireless charging capabilities, though it does not have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ version of the Clicks keyboard measures in at 188.45mm, so it is 41.85mm longer than the 146.6mm ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌. That is equivalent to 1.65 inches, so expect an ‌iPhone‌ equipped with this keyboard to be over an inch and a half longer. It's a little over 3mm wider than the ‌iPhone‌, and 2.50mm thicker. The case weighs in at 62 grams, a little under half of the 187 gram weight of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-gray-color.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nDimensions are similar for the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max models, so the keyboards do add some considerable bulk to the ‌iPhone‌. Clicks says that the keyboard is easy to put on and remove, and while in use, it does serve as a hardware-based keyboard, so you won't see the software keyboard on the display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nClicks for ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ <a href=\"https://www.clicks.tech\">can be pre-ordered from the Clicks website</a>, while the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max version can be reserved for $30.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/clicks-iphone-keyboard/\">Miss Physical Keyboards?
