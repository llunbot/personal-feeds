After nine stages of full-throttle racing from Florence to Burgundy, we finally have the chance to draw some breath and evaluate the state of play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Tadej Pogačar leads the overall classification with a 33-second gap to Remco Evenepoel and a 1:15 advantage over Jonas Vingegaard in third. Biniam Girmay leads the green jersey, Jonas Abrahamsen the polka-dots and Remco Evenepoel is the wearer of the white jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nine stages in, we have had our first real glance at who is gunning for victory, and equally at the riders struggling to keep up with <em>la folie douce</em>. Today, we will run through five winners from the first week and five riders (and teams) in real need of improvement.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

stage win to his name and a 33-second lead in the general classification over his nearest rival Remco Evenepoel. Alongside his personal successes, Pogačar’s UAE Team Emirates squad has looked steadfast in its support for the <em>maillot jaune</em>. João Almeida impressed on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/galibier-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Galibier</a>, and Juan Ayuso remains in the fight for a top five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s stern descent off the Galibier allowed him to scoop a 12th Tour stage win. His perennial rival <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a> wasn’t far behind at the top of the climb, but Pogačar’s ruthlessness has put him in the driving seat going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Stage 9, he wasn’t afraid to ruffle some feathers on the gravel roads. This aggressive style is nothing new for the UAE Team Emirates leader, but it demonstrated a real intent to win this Tour de France early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Remco Evenepoel</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-95.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remco Evenepoel sits in second place in the GC after the first week of racing. Bolstered by a solid claim in the young riders’ classification, the Belgian has surpassed many expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added a Tour de France stage win to his <em>palmarès</em> in the vineyards of Burgundy on Friday. A few days later on Stage 9, he banished any worries about his lack of gravel expertise as he was one of the most aggressive on the stage, daring to attack with just shy of 80km remaining on the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evenepoel’s Soudal-QuickStep teammates have impressed. On the Col du Galibier, Mikel Landa was among the strongest climbers, indicating that he will play an important role in the Belgian’s podium bid later into the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Biniam Girmay</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-96.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s difficult to not wax lyrical about <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Biniam Girmay</a>‘s Tour de France performance this year. The Intermarché all-terrain sprinter has two stage wins, a firm grip on the <em>maillot vert</em>, and has made history by becoming the first Black rider to win a Tour de France stage. By every metric, Girmay is overperforming at this year’s <em>Grande Boucle</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 3’s victory captured imaginations the world over, with fans in Eritrea taking to the streets to celebrate. ‘Bini-mania’ has taken hold and Intermarché have full faith instilled in Girmay. Forget the underwhelming Intermarché of the Giro, the Belgian squad has found its mojo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eritrean now places himself as the frontrunner for the green jersey, his 228-point tally is almost double the amount of his closest challenger Jasper Philipsen. If Girmay were to win the jersey, he’d become the first African to ever win a Tour de France jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Jonas Abrahamsen</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-08T134011.311.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Few casual viewers knew Uno X’s Jonas Abrahamsen before the Tour de France. After nine days of fighting in the breakaway and playing the polka-dot jersey game, the Norwegian has become a breakout star of the 2024 race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He cunningly calculated his breakaways to poach the green jersey for the opening stages, although soon lost it once the bunch sprints kicked in. So far, Abrahamsen has spent 500km in the breakaway fighting for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-prize-money\">the bonus brizes on offer</a>, showing up the French ProTeams that usually fulfil this role and doing it by himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abrahamsen has only worn his Uno X trade kit on one occasion at this Tour de France, having spent the second half of the first week in the polka-dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification.

Bardet also became the first Frenchman in three years to wear the<em> </em>yellow jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is undoubtedly France’s best Tour opener in years. The French have been in the hunt for stages since the race kicked off in Italy. GC hopes look dashed given David Gaudu’s meagre first week, but the French are alive and kicking in their home race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TotalEnergies banished stage-hunting woes to take their first win since 2017, while Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels took a maiden Tour win after ten years of trying.

In comparison to last year, Philipsen is looking more like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/tour-de-france-unchained-netflix-season-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">a disaster than a master</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The green jersey bid is appearing more fleeting. A disciplinary point deduction on Stage 6 and missed opportunity in Turin tell us that Philipsen is on the back foot in the sprinting field.

Roglič was repeatedly in panic stations on the gravel stage and the Slovenian star was the first of the ‘big four’ to falter on the Col du Galibier. Similarly, he shed the most amount of time on Stage 7’s time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-star domestique line-up of Jai Hindley and Sasha Vlasov underwhelmed on Stage 4’s mountain stage too. Vlasov sits outside the top ten in 11th place while Hindley barely makes it inside the top 20.

At this Tour de France, he has barely blinked on the radar of GC riders, dashing the hopes of the Australian team he’s set to leave at the end of the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The race started on unfavourable terms for the 2018 Vuelta winner. On Stage 2’s ascent of San Luca, Yates slipped out of the group of GC favourites in desperate fashion, and his continued poor positioning and lack of climbing legs have seriously plagued his opening week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates now sits 15 minutes behind in the GC, firmly out of the equation for a podium position in Nice. A dramatic loss of time on the gravel roads put him even further back in the standings, with the team finding more success in the sprints courtesy of Dylan Groenewegen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-99.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a barnstorming opening chapter in 2024, Decathlon-AG2R are currently losing steam at the Tour de France. <a href=\"https://x.com/inrng/status/1810015969042944161\" target=\"_blank\">The race’s official rolling prizemoney tallies</a> were announced after Stage 9 and it had the team firmly in last place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The French team’s leader Felix Gall is currently sitting six minutes behind Pogačar in 17th place overall.

Gone are the days of rivalling the super-teams of UAE Team Emirates, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, Ineos Grenadiers and Visma-Lease a Bike.

Bahrain have made the top ten on GC every year since 2020, but that run looks set to be broken in 2024.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/julian-alaphilippe-2019-tour-de-france\">Flashback Friday: When Julian Alaphilippe almost won the Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-tour-de-france-2024\">‘It’s not romantic’: Mark Cavendish on his final Tour de France, #35 and an Astana lifeline</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-grand-depart-gallery\">Gallery: Behind the scenes at the Tour de France 2024 Grand Départ</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-predictions-2024\">Cyclist’s Tour de France predictions 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\">A star is born: Biniam Girmay profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-week-one-tour-de-france-2024\">The winners and losers of the first week of the Tour de France 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"392c7430386d327dc9de12903474d2747cd265cf8d15d04909c95eb99bac8cb8","category":"Cycling"}
