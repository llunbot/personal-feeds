All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/\">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a>, ruling out an update to the all-in-one desktop computer this year. All other desktop Macs, including the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, were already updated in 2023 and are highly unlikely to be updated again until 2024 or later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Macs by Date Last Updated</h3>\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>15-inch MacBook Air:</strong> June 2023</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> June 2023</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> June 2023</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro:</strong> January 2023</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>16-inch MacBook Pro:</strong> January 2023</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mac mini:</strong> January 2023</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>13-inch MacBook Air:</strong> June 2022</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>13-inch MacBook Pro:</strong> June 2022</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iMac:</strong> April 2021</li></ul>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<h2>iPads</h2>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, Kuo said Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/\">unlikely to release any new iPad models</a> before the end of 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to release any new iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini, or entry-level iPad models this year.
