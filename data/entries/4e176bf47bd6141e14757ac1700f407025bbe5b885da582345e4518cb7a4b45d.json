Players must tap on the screen at the perfect moment so that the bird slides down the side of a hill and gains momentum to reach the next island before the sun sets, while aiming to complete tricks for score multipliers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, Apple Arcade provides access to a catalog of over 200 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with additional titles added periodically.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/nba-2k22-tiny-wings-apple-arcade/\">'NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition' and 'Tiny Wings' Coming to Apple Arcade</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nba-2k22-arcade-edition-and-tiny-wings-coming-to-apple-arcade.2310710/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VnnXVysRfpI:F4cFimjyTMw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VnnXVysRfpI:F4cFimjyTMw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VnnXVysRfpI\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e176bf47bd6141e14757ac1700f407025bbe5b885da582345e4518cb7a4b45d","category":"Apple"}
