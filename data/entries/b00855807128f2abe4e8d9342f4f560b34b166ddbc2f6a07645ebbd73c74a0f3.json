Musk criticized Apple's \"walled garden\" and made comments on the company's cobalt use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/tesla-red-orange-bg-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a discussion about plans to allow Tesla competitors to use the Tesla electric vehicle charger network, Musk said that Tesla does not want to create a walled garden to \"bludgeon\" Tesla competitors, alluding to Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> practices.<blockquote>\"I think we do want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy,\" Musk said in response to a question about letting competitors use its charger network. \"It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors which is used by some companies.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMusk then faked a cough and said, \"Apple.\"</blockquote>Apple's iOS platform is often referenced using the term \"walled garden\" because it is a closed platform that Apple has full control over. Apple dictates what software can be installed on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and requires companies to use its ‌App Store‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a discussion about Tesla's batteries, Musk again referenced Apple without being prompted to do so. Musk said that people mistakenly believe that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, which is required for the lithium-ion battery cells used in electronic devices, but it's Apple that uses the most cobalt.<blockquote>\"Apple uses I think almost 100% cobalt in their batteries and cell phones and laptops, but Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron-phosphate packs, and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries,\" Musk said. \"On a weighted-average basis we might use 2% cobalt compared to say, Apple's 100% cobalt. Anyway, so it's just really not a factor.\"</blockquote>Apple does indeed use cobalt, which has in the past been linked to human rights abuses. Apple does, however, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Conflict-Minerals-Report.pdf\">maintain a list</a> of all of its cobalt smelters and refiners, and audits them regularly. In 2020, all of its cobalt suppliers were audited.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple and Tesla have had minor disputes in the past, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/22/apple-hires-former-tesla-car-interior-engineer/\">stealing employees</a> from one another as Apple pushes into the electric vehicle market. Back in 2015, Musk <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/08/elon-musk-apple-hires-fired-tesla-workers/\">famously called Apple</a> the \"Tesla Graveyard.\" \"If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple,\" he said.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMore recently, Musk claimed that he had attempted to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/22/elon-musk-tim-cook-tesla-meeting/\">speak with Apple</a> about a possible acquisition of Tesla at one point in Tesla's early days, but Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> refused to meet with him.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tesla/\">Tesla</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/elon-musk-apple-sniping-tesla-call/\">Tesla CEO Elon Musk Takes Shots at Apple During Earnings Call</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-takes-shots-at-apple-during-earnings-call.2305594/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3Uys4-sZNbo:6g_zzD4W4Xs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3Uys4-sZNbo:6g_zzD4W4Xs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3Uys4-sZNbo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b00855807128f2abe4e8d9342f4f560b34b166ddbc2f6a07645ebbd73c74a0f3","category":"Apple"}
