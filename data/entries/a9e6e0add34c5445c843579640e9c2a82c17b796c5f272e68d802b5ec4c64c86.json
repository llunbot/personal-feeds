The Pixel 7 Pro has 30x digital \"Super Res Zoom\" with its 5x optical zoom lens.  Apple has never leaned into digital zoom because the quality is poor. Optical zoom provides a crisp, clear image using the camera hardware, but digital zoom uses software enhancement to crop in. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n5x optical zoom is an ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max-specific feature that is not available on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌. Both devices share other camera improvements, though. The 48-megapixel main camera has a larger sensor that lets in more light, and it can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also an updated 13mm Ultra Wide camera, and second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/\">iPhone 15 Pro Max's 5x Optical Zoom Lens Enables 25x Digital Zoom</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-maxs-5x-optical-zoom-lens-enables-25x-digital-zoom.2401302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a9e6e0add34c5445c843579640e9c2a82c17b796c5f272e68d802b5ec4c64c86","category":"Apple"}
