{"title":"Sony Is Laying Off 900 PlayStation Employees, 8 Percent of Workforce","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084494/sony-playstation-layoffs-2024","date":1709170303000,"content":"\n<p>Tom Warren, writing for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sony says it’s <a href=\"https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/difficult-news-about-our-workforce/?sf271923331=1\">laying off around 900 employees</a> of its \nPlayStation division, a reduction of its global headcount of \naround 8 percent. Sony’s layoffs will impact a variety of its \nPlayStation studios, including Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, \nGuerrilla Games, and Firesprite. Sony’s layoffs are the latest in \na wave that has been impacting the gaming and tech industries \nthroughout 2024. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems a little ironic that after all the histrionics over Microsoft <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/phil_spencer_puts_apples_money_where_his_mouth_is\">deciding to go cross-platform with some of their Xbox exclusive titles</a> — ostensibly giving Sony an edge — that Sony is now having layoffs in their first-party, exclusive game studios.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I don’t jinx them by pointing this out, but you know who isn’t laying anyone off? Nintendo. <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@invalidname/112006248366838175\">Chris Anderson, on Mastodon</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Someone want to bring back that Nintendo quote about how they \ndon’t do mass layoffs because it’s bad for morale? Or maybe notice \nthat Nintendo tends to do lots of charming, modestly-ambitious \ngames instead of a handful of $200M AAA blockbusters? </p>\n\n<p>In the end, did Nintendo actually win the Console Wars? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They may not have “won”, but Nintendo has never lost.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/28/sony-playstation-layoffs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"13b22a950550dbc5b274beced1e64598c0ad7c05cc2945ba727dc4ded3481372","category":"Tech"}
