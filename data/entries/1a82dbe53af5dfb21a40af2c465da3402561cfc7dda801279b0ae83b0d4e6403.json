That doesn’t mean you’re missing out on performance, though, because Intend made sure to integrate as much technology as possible.</p>\n<p>The Essential fork comes with a cerakoted BCT crown, and its trusted enduro proven steerer tube and upper legs. The fork has a travel range of 150 – 170 mm. It utilizes a simple yet flawless air spring and an open bath damping cartridge which give you that supple and high quality feeling you might or might not (yet) be used to from Intend products and they’re also very user-friendly to service.</p>\n<p><strong>Will you save money over a top-line Intend fork?</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Will you feel a decrease in performance?</strong> Maybe yes, but maybe not</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What are the differences to the Top-Line Originals and Blackline forks?</strong></p>\n<p>The Air spring does not have the Travelizer adjustment. That means you need to disassemble the fork to change the travel.</p>\n<p>It also does not work with the token-less technology by changing the bottom caps for progression. It works with a volume spacer in the bottom cap to adjust this. This volume spacer has three positions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Without, less progression</li>\n<li>Mid position, mid progression (installed in the fork already)</li>\n<li>Max position, max progression</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This new Intend Essential shares the same damping parts as the Originals and Blackline forks, but it’s a semi-open bath system instead of the closed bladder version.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Intend_BC_Essential_Fork4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Is it possible to swap the Essential forks to the Intend Top-line internals?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, but this means the complete bottom section needs to be changed, which is just as expensive as buying a Top-line fork in the first place.
