The Camera, Flashlight, Voice Memo, Focus, and Magnifier functions will no longer activate when the Action Button is pressed if the ‌iPhone‌ is tucked away in a pocket.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-action-button-settings.jpg\" alt width=\"3024\" height=\"1624\" />\r<br />\nActions that make sense to trigger in a pocket like the mute function and a shortcut can still be activated while the ‌iPhone‌ is inside of a pocket by long pressing on the Action Button, but other features are disabled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn earlier versions of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> and iOS 17.1, all of the Action Button functions can be accidentally activated in a pocket, draining ‌iPhone‌ battery and causing unwanted recordings and images.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThough the Action Button requires a long press to activate, there have still been complaints about it triggering unintentionally while in a pocket, which this change will prevent for functions that cannot be used when the ‌iPhone‌ is in a pocket.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that these changes apply only to the Action Button, so it is still possible to accidentally trigger the Camera or the Flashlight from the Lock Screen while the ‌iPhone‌ is in a pocket.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/ios-17-1-action-button-tweak/\">iOS 17.1 Beta 3 Prevents Action Button From Activating the Camera or Flashlight in a Pocket</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-beta-3-prevents-action-button-from-activating-the-camera-or-flashlight-in-a-pocket.2407118/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"56b8e32dc0b8dd1297ac45a7ee6c95cce119574688408c44453a065efa9727e3","category":"Apple"}
