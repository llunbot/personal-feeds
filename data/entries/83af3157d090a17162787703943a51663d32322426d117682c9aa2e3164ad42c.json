The juniors set the early times for others to try and best, aided somewhat by a stiff tailwind funnelled up the gorge, which continued until around half of the men had ridden, before dying away to a flat calm.</p>\n<p>Despite the unpleasant weather, there was a sizable crowd which grew as the morning progressed. Initially the spectators tried to stick to the grass banks, but as they became increasingly churned over by muddy boots they moved onto the tarmac.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/hill_climb_nats-154.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It was a mass of Gore-Tex and umbrellas, and amongst the ubiquitous cowbells there were some more unusual offerings – Didi the devil may reign on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/5875/classic-climbs-alpe-d-huez\" target=\"_blank\">Alpe d’Huez</a>, but up Winnats the crown belongs to a man with a giant doner kebab on a pole.</p>\n<p>As UK hill climbs are governed by CTT (Cycling Time Trials) rather than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uci\" target=\"_blank\">UCI</a>, they aren't subject to the usual onerous rules.</p>\n<p>Helmets aren’t required, socks can be as long as you like, and if you want to saw your brake pads in half to save a few grams then more power to you.</p>\n<p>There were plenty of the classic hill climb mods on show, from sawn off bars, 1× setups and exotic lightweight brakes, through to missing headset caps and some drastic paint removal.</p>\n<p>Despite all this there was an increasing proliferation of aero tech, perhaps as a result of the fast conditions with a tailwind, but also perhaps reflecting a recognition of the importance of aero gains even at low speed.</p>\n<p>Deep section wheels were not uncommon and neither were aero-optimised framesets. It’s certainly going to be interesting to see which school of thought wins out over the coming years.</p>\n<p>One near-universal issue facing every rider was a difficult descent back to the start line. Sodden, wrapped in foil blankets and bin bags, many had to resort to braking with their shoes or simply walking when ice cold, wet brakes on carbon rims failed to provide adequate stopping power.</p>\n<p>\n</p><div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/1697/whats-it-like-to-ride-a-hill-climb\">What's it like to ride a hill climb?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8828/best-of-the-best-cyclist-s-favourite-lightweight-bikes\">Best of the best: Cyclist’s favourite lightweight bikes</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/7055/pain-and-glory-inside-the-catford-hill-climb-the-worlds-oldest-cycling-race\">Pain and glory: Inside the Catford Hill Climb, the world's oldest cycling race</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4343/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: the best bikes on the market from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a></div>    </div></div><p></p>\n<p>This, coupled with spectators in the road, led to a particularly congested course in the latter part of the morning, mostly affecting the women's field. This was unfortunately exacerbated by a noticeable exodus of spectators wending their way back down the hill following the conclusion of the majority of the men's rides.</p>\n<p>The hill climb season is a uniquely British series of races, and while it would have been more pleasant on a crisp, dry morning, there was something very fitting about the weather.</p>\n<p>It tied together the event and the landscape in a way blue skies couldn't have, and it certainly made it a memorable day in the hills for riders and spectators alike.</p>\n<p>Tom Bell of High North Performance took the overall and male categories with a time of 3:01.6sec, beating last year's winner Andrew Feather by a 7-second margin.</p>\n<p>In the women's field, reigning champion Bithja Jones of Pankhurst Cycles successfully defended her title with a time of 4:00.4.</p>\n<p>In the junior fields Tomos Pattinson of Halesowen A&amp;CC and Sannah Zaman of Bigfoot CC took the stripes with times of 3:26.6 and 4:44.1 respectively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/hill_climb_nats-032.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><span>A welcome tailwind helped the earlier riders, but petered out later

lightweight, low-profile front wheel – aero aside, this will have made braking a whole lot easier on the ride back down to the start line.</span></p>\n<p><span><img
