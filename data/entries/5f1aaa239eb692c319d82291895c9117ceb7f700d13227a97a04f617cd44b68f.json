The event was primarily focused on the Apple Watch, which was being fully detailed ahead of its launch the following month, so the debut of the brand-new MacBook line took many by surprise. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> introduced the new MacBook as a \"reinvention\" of the notebook.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device was extremely controversial due to its underpowered performance, single USB-C port for both charging and data transfer, short battery life, unreliable butterfly keyboard, and high price point ($1,299 starting price in 2015—the same as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> at the time).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, the 12-inch MacBook offered a glimpse at what was to come in the Mac lineup. It was the first Apple device with a USB-C port, terraced battery, butterfly keyboard, and haptic trackpad. It was also the first MacBook with a design focused on efficiency, a Retina display in a non-Pro model, multiple color options, and without a fan or an illuminated Apple logo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2016, Apple refreshed the 12-inch MacBook to add Intel Skylake Core m3, m5, and m7 processors, improved battery life and faster PCIe storage, and a Rose Gold color option. In 2017, it introduced Intel Kaby Lake Core m3, i5, and i7 processors, and a second-generation butterfly keyboard for slightly better reliability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt was discontinued upon the introduction of the 2019 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. The 12-inch MacBook was functionally replaced by the 2018 ‌MacBook Air‌, which effectively adopted its design, but with an additional USB-C port,  a single fan for active cooling, and a larger display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat do you think about the 12-inch MacBook a whole decade later?
