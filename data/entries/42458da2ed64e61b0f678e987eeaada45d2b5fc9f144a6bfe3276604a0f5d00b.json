We’ve had so many races this past week it’s almost hard to know where to begin, but let’s not complain about a good thing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben O’Connor (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) won via a breakaway at the Vuelta a Murcia, as did <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> (Soudal-Quick Step) at the Figueria Champions Classic, the Belgian champion launching a scathing 53km solo attack that no one could answer. Carrying on the theme, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/movistar\" target=\"_blank\">Movistar’s</a> Oier Lazkano also won with an impressive breakaway at the Clásica Jaén Paraíso Interior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotte Kopecky (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/sd-worx\" target=\"_blank\">SD Worx-Protime</a>) won the overall classification at the UAE Tour Women and Mads Pedersen (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a>) topped the standings at the Tour de la Provence. It was a close finish at the Clásica de Almería, however, Olav Kooij (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a>) almost celebrating his win too early as Matteo Moschetti (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team) launched an impressive bike throw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Tour of Oman still ongoing, Finn Fisher-Black (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>) now leads the general classification by three seconds ahead of Luke Lamperti (Soudal-Quick Step) as they head into the fifth and final stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also announced that Rigoberto Urán (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ef-education-easypost\" target=\"_blank\">EF Education-EasyPost</a>) will retire at the end of the 2024 season. He’s certainly been an entertainer.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mads-pedersen-qa\">‘I’m just taking everything I can from it right now’: Mads Pedersen Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-guide\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2024: Routes, TV and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2024 route headlined by double Monte Grappa ascent</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>SD Worx-Protime dominate at the UAE Tour Women</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/GF-eHa-WAAAtc8b.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was show time for SD Worx-Protime at the four-stage UAE Tour Women. Lorena Wiebes kicked things off by sprinting to victory on the first two flat stages as Lotte Kopecky won on Stage 3 atop Jebel Hafeet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was on this third stage that 21-year-old Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM) shone, attacking from the lead group in the final 3km towards the finish. It was a powerful effort by the Zwift Academy winner but ultimately she was reeled in by World Champion Kopecky, who caught up to Bradbury in the final kilometre, powering ahead in the last 150m to win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the breakaway action recently must have rubbed off on Amber Kraak (FDJ Suez), who, on the final stage around Abu Dhabi and on what was expected to be a sprinters’ day, dispatched her breakaway companions to go solo in the last 6km. It was another case of heart-in-mouth breakaway action as the sprinters tried to catch up with the lone rider. Another 100 metres and she would have been absorbed by the mass. Kraak made it to thwart an SD Worx-Protime clean sweep (Wiebes was less than a second behind her), celebrating her first WorldTour win with her FDJ Suez teammates after all made it across the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mads Pedersen in control at the Tour de la Provence</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Four wins in one week for Pedersen <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png\" alt=\"🤯\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a5.png\" alt=\"💥\" /><br /><br />The Lidl-Trek rider is having a supersonic start to 2024 <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44a-1f3fd.png\" alt=\"👊🏽\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4f8.png\" alt=\"📸\" /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GettyImages?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@gettyimages</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RImXaFaOhr\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/RImXaFaOhr</a></p>— Velon CC (@VelonCC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VelonCC/status/1756351801115255190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">February 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a theme of dominating here but Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) did just that at the four-day Tour de la Provence. Pedersen won the 5km time-trial prologue before sprinting to the win on Stage 2 towards Martigues ahead of Cofidis’ Axel Zingle. This was replicated on the following day towards Manosque, Pedersen again victorious ahead of Zingle on a hilly Stage 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was understandable that all eyes remained on Pedersen heading into the final stage and whether he could secure a clean sweep at the Tour de la Provence. It looked likely as the field reeled Lidl-Trek’s Alex Kirsch back in, but the day would be won by Tom van Asbroeck (Israel-Premier Tech) just ahead of Sam Bennett (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) as Pedersen finished in 5<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adrien Petit’s act of selflessness</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"👏\" /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adrienpetit62?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@adrienpetit62</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1kD3DYvtLr\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/1kD3DYvtLr</a></p>— Intermarché-Wanty (@IntermarcheW) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IntermarcheW/status/1756728666237633015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">February 11, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Clásica de Almería saw a tight finish between winner Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) and second place Matteo Moschetti (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team), but the final few metres of the race saw a high-speed crash that caused three riders to hit the ground. Manuel Peñalver of Polti Kometa looked to be worst affected, staying down after falling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adrien Petit (Intermarché-Wanty) got off his bike before the finish line to see to Peñalver, checking on and talking to him before race doctors got there. It was a wonderful display of selflessness and sportsmanship between riders, especially given the length of time it took for medical assistance to reach Peñalver. Respect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also good to see Peñalver getting up on his feet and walking afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Taco van der Hoorn still recovering from concussion</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>MEDICAL UPDATE: Taco van der Hoorn<br /><br />9 months since his crash in Tour of Flanders, Taco is still recovering from his concussion &amp; closely monitored.<br /><br />He briefly joined the team on training camp in January, however he can't return in the peloton yet.<br /><br />FULL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png\" alt=\"➡\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/b7TjjuAuHl\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/b7TjjuAuHl</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GtV6zxBh5G\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/GtV6zxBh5G</a></p>— Intermarché-Wanty (@IntermarcheW) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IntermarcheW/status/1757362883225174112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">February 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarché-Wanty) crashed heavily at the Tour of Flanders last year and is still suffering the effects of a severe concussion. Intermarché-Wanty released a statement today that read Van der Hoorn is ‘still undergoing a long period of rehabilitation, with gradual progress, but sometimes slowed down by certain effects linked to the severity of the concussion.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 30-year-old joined his team at their Alicante training camp in January. While he did not participate in group rides, he can train solo with certain sessions in company of sports directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van der Hoorn is an exciting rider to watch on the bike as evidenced by his Stage 3 breakaway victory at the 2021 Giro d’Italia. It’s always good to see appropriate medical care following a concussion, such as FDJ-Suez’s Marta Cavalli’s time off the bike due to her concussion sustained at the Tour de France Femmes. While it must be frustrating for Van der Hoorn, it must be commended that his return is not rushed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-log-lotte-kopecky-uae-tour\">Pro Log: Lotte Kopecky wins UAE Tour Women, Mads Pedersen dominates Tour de la Provence, Adrien Petit’s heart-warming act of respect and update on Taco van der Hoorn’s concussion</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"42458da2ed64e61b0f678e987eeaada45d2b5fc9f144a6bfe3276604a0f5d00b","category":"Cycling"}
