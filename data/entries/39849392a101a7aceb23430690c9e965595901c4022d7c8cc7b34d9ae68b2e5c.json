But if you can’t wait until September for iPadOS 19, you could always turn to…Microsoft Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A developer called NTDEV figured out how to run Windows 11 on an M2 iPad Air. The implementation involves using an app called <a href=\"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM\">UTM</a> that was sideloaded onto an iPad (sideloading is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218208/ios-17-4-alternative-app-stores-emoji-fixes-security-updates-install.html\">allowed</a> in the European Union, thanks to the EU’s Digital Markets Act). UTM is then used to run a <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/just-in-time-compilation-explained/\">JIT</a> emulator that runs Windows 11 on the iPad. You can see it working in the video NTDEV <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eQuQaa_WkEM?si=815km9lt2Gm0SUJJ\">posted</a> on YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t feel like watching over eight minutes of Windows 11 on an iPad (booting feels like it takes <em>forever</em>), NTDEV <a href=\"https://x.com/NTDEV_/status/1913726329184567790\">said</a> on X that it “actually works quite decently.” Windows Latest <a href=\"https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/04/22/dev-runs-windows-11-arm-on-ipad-air-m2-using-utm-with-jit-and-its-decent/\">reports</a> that NTDEV used “a slimmed version of Windows 11” made with <a href=\"https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder\">Tiny 11</a>, which is used to “install the operating system without bloatware.” (I admit, I snickered at the “bloatware” bit.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While NTDEV made a cool demo, you’re probably asking, why? Microsoft makes these things called Surface 2-in-1 PCs that run Windows much more efficiently and have a touchscreen UI, so why even bother with Windows on an iPad? Well, NTDEV’s X profile says, “Trying stuff so you don’t have to,” which says it all right there. But if you really “have to,” Windows Latest has steps at the end of their <a href=\"https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/04/22/dev-runs-windows-11-arm-on-ipad-air-m2-using-utm-with-jit-and-its-decent/\">report</a> on how to do this.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"39849392a101a7aceb23430690c9e965595901c4022d7c8cc7b34d9ae68b2e5c","category":"Apple"}
