It’s perfect timing, especially if, like me, you live in an election swing state. The one thing all voters (and, now that I think about it, surely non-voters alike) agree on is annoyance at political robocalls and robotexts.</p>\n\n<p>While every candidate, campaign, PAC, and political party uses robocalls and texts, Nomorobo is tracking them and gives you control over who you want to hear from, and who you don’t.</p>\n\n<p>Use Nomorobo’s powerful but very easy-to-use tools to identify, block, and report the calls and texts you don’t want to receive anymore, and they’ll handle the rest. Nomorobo integrates with iOS’s built-in functionality for filtering calls and text messages. I’ve been a paying customer of Nomorobo since 2017. My iPhone doesn’t even ring when a call comes in from a known robocaller. It’s a great app and it really works. If you wish you had better options for screening out robocalls and texts, <a href=\"https://go.nomorobo.com/daringfireball\">try Nomorobo</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/03/nomorobo\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"adf27d70af123bf96501ebc1fad51017ca54f0b52737f0044154270baa1be3be","category":"Tech"}
