Taking full advantage of new UCI rules, Lotus created an 8cm wide carbon fork and integrated handlebar, to pair with Hope’s 8cm wide seat stay blades, that were said to improve aerodynamics when the bike and rider were considered as one unit. Now, Hope Technology have made a road-worthy version of the HB.T, creating what is quite possibly the wildest looking time trial bike on the planet. We caught up with the man responsible, Sam Pendred, to learn more about the Hope HB.TT.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x645/rscb28/ng:webp/ngcb28\" alt=\"hpe hb.tt front view wide bladed aero fork\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-225x300.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 225w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-800x1067.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-90x120.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 90w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-768x1024.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-1152x1536.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1152w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-696x928.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-1068x1424.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-315x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x645/rscb28/ng:webp/ngcb28\" ezoid=\"0.7068291278577263\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-225x300.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 225w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-800x1067.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-90x120.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 90w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-768x1024.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-1152x1536.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1152w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-696x928.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-1068x1424.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17085332/hope-hb-tt-front-view-8-cm-wide-fork-seat-stay-blades-315x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 315w\"></a></p><p>First off, why?

one?</h3><p>Not yet. Yet, being the operative word. <em>“We are currently looking into ways that will reduce the cost of the bikes so we can offer them at a much more affordable price. With unavoidable complexity in some of the custom components and the desire to maintain the grade of carbon used in the Olympic bikes, we think it may be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000”</em> – Sam Pendred.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>HopeTech.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"49247959d93d06f6353c15787b5cec88ab3a37c9e075ab6988d4a632f48c2c9f","category":"Cycling"}
