For the 45mm model, the screen will measure in at 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches, and it will have a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448, which equates to 16 percent more pixels. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> has not provided similar details for the 41mm model, but it too will see a comparable increase in body size, and both models will have slimmed down display borders.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe larger 45mm Apple Watch will have more space for complications, and Apple has multiple new watch faces in the works to go along with the Series 7 models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA Modular Max watch face will offer the digital time alongside a small complication like temperature, while additional larger complications will be stacked on top of each other below. It's similar to Infograph Modular, but can show more than one large complication.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA Continuum face will shift based on \"the flow of time and the current hour,\" and a new world time watch face will allow users to see all 24 time zones simultaneously. An external dial will display the time zones, while an inner dial will display the time in each location. <em>Bloomberg</em> says it's similar to watch faces popularized by luxury watch makers Patek Philippe, Breitling, and others.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a new Hermes watch face that features numbers that change hour by hour, and a new Nike watch face with numbers that change based on a person's motion.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 will also feature a new S7 chip and a flat-edged design that will match the design of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, but we are not expecting new health features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is expected to introduce the new Apple Watch at an event that's set to be held in September, but recent rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/apple-watch-series-7-production-delay/\">of production issues</a> may see the actual launch delayed or watch supplies limited when it first debuts.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNext year, <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Apple will debut a new low-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, and a rugged model aimed at extreme sports users alongside the traditional flagship update. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/apple-watch-series-7-new-watch-faces-larger-display/\">Apple Watch Series 7 to Feature Several New Faces to Take Advantage of 16% Larger Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-to-feature-several-new-faces-to-take-advantage-of-16-larger-display.2309555/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JUPp0Xhsuo0:ncPxRzw-qeo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JUPp0Xhsuo0:ncPxRzw-qeo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JUPp0Xhsuo0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1170d153a30dfbe8dbda0433257de6922206561d95627b43167952d344e138f2","category":"Apple"}
