While John was in Chico eating all of Travis’ vegan snacks at <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Engineering</a>, he documented Liz’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crust-bikes-alumalith-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Alumalith</a>, which Paul had just finished building. Liz is Paul’s partner, and she had her eye on a Ron’s Crust Bikes Alumalith. So Paul built her one, and it’s wild. Read on for some words by Paul himself about the bike…</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Liz saw the Alumilith at the Philadelphia Bike Expo in 2022. She said she thought that was the kind of bike for her, which was a first. I took that hint and ran with it, like any adoring bike dork boyfriend. And we’re still together! It’s a miracle, especially considering the curse. If you don’t know about the curse, don’t even worry about it. It shall remain unmentioned. But, IYKYK.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Then, true to form I let it languish in our on site bike shop for at least six months while I collected parts. Liz came up with the color scheme, and I came up with the name “Desert Sunset” after spending a week in the Mojave. Orange, gold and red. Pretty good desert colors, eh?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-15.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-15.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Then the bike and the parts sat for another few months. All the while the curse is in the back of my head. But, she had mentioned she wanted to build it and learn about how a bike goes together. Had I just discovered a loophole? If she puts it together does that negate the curse? Or at least lower its risk factor?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-20.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-20.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-21.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-21.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-22.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-22.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Putting the bike together with her was a great day. She’s naturally curious about stuff and wants to know at least enough to get home if something went wrong. I pretty much did a couple things but mostly talked her through all the weird threads and thread directions and all the rest.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Paul-Component-Engineering-Rons-Bikes-Alumalith-Build-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The bike is a stunner. It looks real good sitting in front of our favorite restaurant, 5th St Steakhouse where we ride together when we’re getting all fancified. Then again it looks just as good in front of the gritty Duffy’s bar on the corner.</p>\n<p><strong>Build Spec:</strong></p>\n<p>Frame: Ron’s Crust Bikes Alumalith made by Frank the Welder<br />\nFork: Frank the Welder Switch Blade<br />\nSeatpost: Paul Tall and Handsome<br />\nSeat Collar: Paul<br />\nStem: Paul Boxcar<br />\nBars: Sim Works Ramble<br />\nHeadset: White Industries<br />\nHeadset Spacers: White Industries<br />\nBrake Levers: Paul Love<br />\nBrake Calipers: Paul Moto Lite<br />\nDerailleur: Shimano Dura-Ace<br />\nShifter: Shimano with Paul Thumbie<br />\nCrankset: White Industries<br />\nChainring: White Industries<br />\nRims: Velocity Polished Cliffhanger<br />\nHubs: Paul<br />\nSkewers: Paul<br />\nTires: Ultradynamico Mars 2.3″<br />\nSaddle: Brooks<br />\nGrips: Brooks Cambium</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
