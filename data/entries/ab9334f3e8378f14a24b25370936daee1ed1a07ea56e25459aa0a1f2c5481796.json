To give their athletes the best chance to stay rubber side down, Maxxis has updated the High Roller tire with a new third-generation model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new High Roller is an aggressive, durable tire designed to excel in variable conditions. It has been tested and raced on the World Cup DH circuit where Maxxis athletes Jackson Goldstone, Ronan Dunne, Marine Cabirou, and Ellie Hulsebosch have already brought it to the podium. A quick look at the photos shows the side knobs haven’t vastly changed since the High Roller II, but the center knobs have been completely revised. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Maxxis High Roller – Third Generation:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maxxis calls the new High Roller ‘an intermediate tire with an aggressive tread design’. It was designed for the tough and ever-varying conditions found on World Cup DH courses. As far as Maxxis’ model lineup it sits between the Assegai and Shorty tires, both of which are categorized for Trail/Enduro/DH riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-rendering-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-rendering-angle.jpg\" alt=\"Maxxis High Roller Third Generation, rendering, angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-rendering-angle.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-rendering-angle-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-rendering-angle-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-rendering-angle-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Maxxis)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tire’s design combines an open tread pattern with large sturdy side knobs. Maxxis says this allows for good soil penetration in wet conditions and offers solid cornering traction in dry or dusty conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-on-DH-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1797\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-on-DH-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Maxxis High Roller Third Generation, on DH bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-on-DH-bike.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-on-DH-bike-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-on-DH-bike-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-on-DH-bike-768x1150.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-on-DH-bike-1026x1536.jpg 1026w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new High Rollers use Maxxis’ ultra-sticky MaxxGrip compound, and the DH models feature a durable 2 x 60 TPI downhill casing with an updated butyl insert and tread extrusion. This tough casing helps take the edge off harsh impacts from rocks and roots. All models are, of course, tubeless-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tread Pattern:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-tread-vertical.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-tread-vertical.jpg\" alt=\"Maxxis High Roller Third Generation, tread pattern\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-tread-vertical.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-tread-vertical-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-tread-vertical-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-tread-vertical-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-tread-vertical-1024x1536.jpg 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new High Roller tire has two rows of square center knobs, with sipes in both directions on alternating rows. The center knobs are moderately ramped. Each side gets one row of side knobs with alternating rectangle/notched rectangle shapes. The rectangular knobs include lengthwise sipes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison the previous model High Roller II’s center knobs alternate between fully ramped, wedge-shaped single knobs and double rows of ramped rectangular knobs. The side knobs are slightly different on the new tire but haven’t seen major changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Models and Specs:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-spec-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-spec-chart.jpg\" alt=\"Maxxis High Roller Third Generation, spec chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-spec-chart.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-spec-chart-297x83.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-spec-chart-120x34.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-spec-chart-768x216.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The third-generation High Roller will be available with DH, Double Down, or EXO+ casings. They come in a 2.4” width only for 27.5” or 29” wheels. Maxxis has the DH casing model available now, and the other casing options will be coming soon. See the chart above for listed weights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a little nod to planet Earth, Maxxis is using fully recyclable packaging for the new High Roller tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump.jpg\" alt=\"Maxxis High Roller Third Generation, Ellie Hulsebosch, jump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maxxis-High-roller-third-gen-Ellie-Hulsebosch-jump-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Images c.
