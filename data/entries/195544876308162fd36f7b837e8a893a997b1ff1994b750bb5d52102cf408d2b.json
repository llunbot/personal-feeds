But before we officially enter <em>pre</em>:Invent sea­­son, let’s have a look at some of last week’s exciting news and announcements.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Last Week’s Launches</span> </strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Control Tower – </strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/\">AWS Control Tower</a> released 22 proactive controls and 10 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/\">AWS Security Hub</a> detective controls to help you meet regulatory requirements and meet control objectives such as encrypting data in transit, encrypting data at rest, or using strong authentication. For more details and a list of controls, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/2023-all.html#q3-new-controls\">check out the AWS Control Tower user guide</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong> – Just a week after <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-is-now-generally-available-build-and-scale-generative-ai-applications-with-foundation-models/\">Amazon Bedrock became available</a> in AWS Regions US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon), Amazon Bedrock is now also <a href=\"https://ap-northeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=ap-northeast-1#/\">available in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) AWS Region</a>. To get started building and scaling generative AI applications with foundation models, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html\">Amazon Bedrock documentation</a>, explore the <a href=\"https://community.aws/generative-ai\">generative AI space at community.aws</a>, and get hands-on with the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-workshop\">Amazon Bedrock workshop</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service</strong> – You can now <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/version-migration.html\">run OpenSearch version 2.9</a> in Amazon OpenSearch Service with improvements to search, observability, security analytics, and machine learning (ML) capabilities. OpenSearch Service has <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-opensearch-service-version-2-9-geospatial-aggregations-support/\">expanded its geospatial aggregations support</a> in version 2.9 to gather insights on high-level overview of trends and patterns and establish correlations within the data. OpenSearch Service 2.9 now also <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-opensearch-service-integrations/\">comes with OpenSearch Service Integrations</a> to take advantage of new schema standards such as OpenTelemetry and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-opensearch-service-alerting-anomalies-dashboards/\">supports managing and overlaying alerts and anomalies</a> onto dashboard visualization line charts.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon SageMaker</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-sagemaker-feature-store-memory-store-latency-retrieval/\">SageMaker Feature Store now supports a fully managed, in-memory online store</a> to help you retrieve features for model serving in real time for high throughput ML applications. The new online store is powered by ElastiCache for Redis, an in-memory data store built on open-source Redis. The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store-storage-configurations-online-store.html\">SageMaker developer guide</a> has all the details.</p> \n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-sagemaker-model-registry-private-model-repositories/\">SageMaker Model Registry added support for private model repositories</a>. You can now register models that are stored in private Docker repositories and track all your models across multiple private AWS and non-AWS model repositories in one central service, simplifying ML operations (MLOps) and ML governance at scale. The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-containers-inference-private.html\">SageMaker Developer Guide</a> shows you how to get started.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon SageMaker Canvas</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-sagemaker-canvas-ready-to-use-models-fms/\">SageMaker Canvas expanded its support for ready-to-use models to include foundation models (FMs)</a>. You can now access FMs such as Claude 2, Amazon Titan, and Jurassic-2 (powered by Amazon Bedrock) as well as publicly available models such as Falcon and MPT (powered by SageMaker JumpStart) through a no-code chat interface. Check out the<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-fm-chat.html\"> SageMaker Developer Guide</a> for more details.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><strong><u>Other AWS News<br /> </u></strong>Here are some additional blog posts and news items that you might find interesting:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/behind-the-scenes-on-aws-contributions-to-open-source-databases/\"><strong>Behind the scenes on AWS contributions to open-source databases</strong></a> – This post shares some of the more substantial open-source contributions AWS has made in the past two years to upstream databases, introduces some key contributors, and shares how AWS approaches upstream work in our database services.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fast-and-cost-effective-llama-2-fine-tuning-with-aws-trainium/\"><strong>Fast and cost-effective Llama 2 fine-tuning with AWS Trainium</strong></a> – This post shows you how to fine-tune the Llama 2 model from Meta on AWS Trainium, a purpose-built accelerator for LLM training, to reduce training times and costs.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/code-llama-code-generation-models-from-meta-are-now-available-via-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/\"><strong>Code Llama code generation models from Meta are now available via Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</strong></a> – You can now deploy Code Llama FMs, developed by Meta, with one click in SageMaker JumpStart.
