For customers who did not manage to pre-order their desired Apple Watch for launch day delivery, some configurations will likely be available for Apple Store pickup on launch day.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple Watch Series 7 pricing starts at $399 for aluminum models, $699 for stainless steel models, and $799 for titanium models. Apple has finally updated its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/studio/apple-watch\">Apple Watch Studio page</a> that helps with choosing a case, size, and band, and the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/\">Apple Watch comparison page</a> is also now updated to reflect the Series 7's tech specs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple Watch Series 7 will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, October 15.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/apple-watch-series-7-november-delivery/\">Apple Watch Series 7 Already Facing November Delivery for Some Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-already-facing-november-delivery-for-some-models.2316000/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0k3L1mXAOI8:uISGHKrhx7A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0k3L1mXAOI8:uISGHKrhx7A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0k3L1mXAOI8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07bfbbddda170bfd95b5cf4af04dc5533afa9f839ff366214e1fa7299e9735f1","category":"Apple"}
