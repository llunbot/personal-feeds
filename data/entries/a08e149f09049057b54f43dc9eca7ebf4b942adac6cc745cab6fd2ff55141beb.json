The research firm predicted that the device will start at $1,199 in the U.S., which would be a $100 price increase compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The device is expected to exclusively feature a periscope lens that enables up to 6x optical zoom, double the current limit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite predicting a price increase for the Pro Max model this year, TrendForce expects that the device will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-128gb-storage-8gb-ram-trendforce/\">continue to start with 128GB of storage</a>, rather than 256GB as previously rumored. On the other hand, the research firm expects both iPhone 15 Pro models to be equipped with 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTime will soon tell if TrendForce is accurate with its latest predictions, as Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 series at its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">event on Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.
