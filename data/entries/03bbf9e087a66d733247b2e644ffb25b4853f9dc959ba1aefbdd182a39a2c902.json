{"title":"Remembering Alex Hay, the Maker of Toolbox Pro","link":"https://www.macstories.net/stories/remembering-alex-hay-the-maker-of-toolbox-pro-during-automation-april/","date":1680305896000,"content":"\n<p>John Voorhees, writing at MacStories:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have some sad news to share with the MacStories community.\nRecently, <a href=\"https://alexhay.dev/\">Alex Hay</a>, the developer of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977\">Toolbox Pro</a>\nand other apps, passed away after a battle with cancer. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The news of Alex’s passing reached us just as Federico and I were\nfinalizing our plans for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/coming-soon-the-second-annual-automation-april-community-event-featuring-shortcuts-interviews-discord-workshops-and-a-shortcut-contest/\">Automation April</a>, leaving us\nshaken. Our reactions were the same: to use Automation April, an\nevent that brings all corners of the Apple automation community\ntogether to remember and honor Alex’s memory.</p>\n\n<p>So, with his family’s blessing, we’re dedicating Automation April\n2023 in memory of Alex Hay, a brilliant and beloved member of the\nautomation community who was taken from us far too early at the\nage of 36. MacStories is also making donations to the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/\">American\nCancer Society</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/\">Cancer Research UK</a> in Alex’s\nname, and we’d love it if you would join us in making a donation\nusing the links above too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’re ready for a gut punch, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/11m6rsd/wont_get_to_play_it/\">here’s Hay on Reddit just a few weeks ago</a>, lamenting the too-far-in-the-future release date for the upcoming game Starfield. <em>Fuck cancer</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t say I knew him well, but I’d interacted with him a few times, and know he was a longtime DF reader. His apps <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977\">Toolbox Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logger-for-shortcuts/id1611554653\">Logger for Shortcuts</a> are my two favorite Shortcuts utilities. (I’ve always been a <code>printf()</code> debugger and that’s what Logger enables for Shortcuts hacking.)</p>\n\n<p>Dedicating MacStories’s annual Automation April in Hay’s honor is a splendid idea, as is using it to raise money for cancer research.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/31/alex-hay-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"03bbf9e087a66d733247b2e644ffb25b4853f9dc959ba1aefbdd182a39a2c902","category":"Tech"}
