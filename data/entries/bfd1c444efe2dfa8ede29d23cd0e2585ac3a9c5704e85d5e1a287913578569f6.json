Also the bike is branded with Cannondale’s ‘Lab71’ logo, which suggests it’s the new for 2023 S-Works-esque top end frame, but that’s actually just branding, as it is actually the Hi-Mod version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, given that the bonus of a Lab71 frame pretty much boils down to a 40g saving, it’s not the end of the world. Plus everyone will think you do have the Lab71 version. Win, win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s currently available in sizes 44 to 58 (but 56 is already sold out) and comes in team colours, but they’re not that crazy so it shouldn’t be a sticking point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix-970x634.png\" alt=\"picture of a bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix-970x634.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix-300x196.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix-768x502.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix-1536x1004.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix-750x490.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix-1140x745.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ef-2023-systemsix.png 1998w\" /><figcaption>EF Pro Cycling</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as that, the team’s 2023 Cannondale SystemSix Hi-Mod Dura-Ace aero bike is on sale too, albeit in fewer sizes, just 51-58. Aero frame aside the bikes on sale have the exact same spec as the SuperSix, so if you did fancy the aero wheels you’d normally see on these bikes you’d have to find those elsewhere. Again, it’s labelled Lab71 but Cannondale doesn’t have a Lab71 SystemSix on the market yet so it’s a Hi-Mod frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That bike is currently available for just £4,657.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For even more deals, EF also has its 2022 SystemSix Dura-Ace available for just £3,659 in sizes 47-58 and its 2022 SuperSix Ultegra for £3,742 in just a 54 and 56.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see all the bikes and to buy, visit <a href=\"https://www.efbike.com/collections/bikes\" target=\"_blank\">efbike.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ef-team-bikes-2023-sale\">EF are selling their 2023 Dura-Ace-equipped team bikes for under £5k</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bfd1c444efe2dfa8ede29d23cd0e2585ac3a9c5704e85d5e1a287913578569f6","category":"Cycling"}
