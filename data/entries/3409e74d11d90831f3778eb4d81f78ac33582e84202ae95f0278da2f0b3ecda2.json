The corrupted audio \"can manifest as a popping sound.\" The Sonos devices' improved Dolby decoder should no longer force listeners to hear what it sounds like when digital audio transmissions go awry.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984522#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984522&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3409e74d11d90831f3778eb4d81f78ac33582e84202ae95f0278da2f0b3ecda2","category":"Tech"}
