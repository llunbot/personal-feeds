Introducing the skills and tools involved through the process of constructing and brazing your own steel frame.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Students will initially go through the process of designing a frame, selecting tubing and frame parts and talking design theory and fit with our framebuilders in a one to one remote consultation process. You will then visit the workshops for a 5 day hands-on practical course where you will build it! Learning all of the steps in the process and getting to try every aspect of building your very own brass fillet brazed steel bicycle frame with the Stayer workshop framebuilding team.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-04.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-04.webp?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-04.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-04.webp?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The build will involve mitering tubing, tacking and brazing the frame as well as attaching frame furniture with silver. Basic construction methods will be addressed along with all of the processes needed to finish the frame to an unfiled brass fillet finish at the workshop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-01.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-01.webp?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-01.webp?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Stayer_Cycles_Framebuilding_101-01.webp?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The course will focus on brass brazing and silver soldering frame construction methods. Materials costs will be additional to the course costs. As a guide frame materials (tubing, dropouts and brazing rod) will cost around £400 but, within the constraints of the taught skills, are very much open to your choice so can be altered to fit your budget.</p>\n<p>Two students per course.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.stayercycles.com/product/framebuilding-101/\" target=\"_blank\">Stayer Cycles</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/stayer-cycles-framebuilding-101-class/\">Stayer Cycles Framebuilding 101 Class</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f6659ca80d5dc85ebf9cb8557c5bf98cde232f3c74fc3969f7eb84d5556643fe","category":"Cycling"}
