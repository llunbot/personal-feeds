In this scenario, it is possible the adapter could provide a direct connection to a Mac for visionOS app development in Xcode, but the adapter's purpose ultimately remains a mystery for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro's external battery pack attaches to the left side of the headset, so the USB-C adapter is connected on the other side.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro isn't launching until early 2024, so we'll learn more details about the headset over the coming months.
