{"title":"Daylight Computer’s DC-1 Tablet","link":"https://daylightcomputer.com","date":1716605068000,"content":"\n<p>New $730 tablet with a sounds-too-good-to-be-true 10.5-inch e-ink-like “e-paper” display that refreshes at 60 fps. Super visible in daylight, amber backlighting at night. Runs a custom version of Android, ships with a stylus, and looks really nice. I jumped on a pre-order.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://om.co/2024/05/18/daylight-tablet/\">Om Malik got an early look</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What the company has created is a beautiful tablet — about the\nsize of a normal iPad Air. It is just a “little less than white,”\nwhite, with a gorgeous screen. It is very simple, elegant, and\nlovely. It has an e-ink screen, and the matte monochrome\npaper-like display is optimized for reading, writing, and\nnote-taking. It refreshes at 60 frames per second, a pretty big\ndeal for e-ink displays. This is much less stressful on the eye\nand easy to use even in direct sunlight. It has 8 GB memory, about\n128 GB in-built storage, an 8-core chip, microphones, speakers,\nand a powerful battery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/daylight-computer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b06a146b4e557768d47c8dde9de897d2c2ab9e6af50688047d5a6c8f974257c6","category":"Tech"}
