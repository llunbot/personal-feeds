Which is why <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-apple-stickers/\">this report from 9to5Mac</a> caught my eye: Apple is apparently starting to wind down its decades-long practice of including Apple logo stickers in the box with all of its products.</p>\n<p>If you buy a new iPad Air or iPad Pro, you’ll be able to get some stickers if you ask the people at the Apple Store to include them (stores will get a “limited quantity” of stickers they can distribute on request). But the little sticker insert that has come with Macs, iPods, iPhones, iPads, and other devices and accessories for as long as I can remember will stop being one of the default pack-ins.</p>\n<p>Apple is apparently cutting down on its sticker distribution to help meet its environmental goals. The stickers are some of the last bits of plastic included in most modern Apple packaging; in recent years, even the plastic backing layer for the stickers has been replaced with wax paper instead. This happened around the same time that the inner layer of packaging wrapped around new Apple devices also shifted from plastic to paper and when plastic-sealed boxes gave way to tear-away paper adhesive strips.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023072#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023072&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"052ad65990966cbab057b3c131701ee3cb74a9a465e92df15fe5c17f9f7933e6","category":"Tech"}
