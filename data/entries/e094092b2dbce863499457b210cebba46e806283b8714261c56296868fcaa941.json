For comparison, the current iPhone 16 Pro measures 8.25mm thick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAchieving this level of thinness is unlikely to come without compromise. Dummy models shared by <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7K73umk9k\">AppleTrack</a></em> suggest that Apple has made some subtle adjustments to accommodate internal components in the tighter chassis. Most notably, the USB-C port on the bottom edge is no longer centered front-to-back. Instead, it appears shifted closer to the rear of the device, which is likely to accommodate display components within the enclosure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are other signs of Apple's re-engineering efforts. The speaker grilles, for example, show a pared-back design, with only two holes on either side of the port compared to the typical five. That reduction reflects the same space-saving measures required to fit in a battery, processor, display components, and speakers within a much slimmer frame.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iphone-17-air-appletrack.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5094\" height=\"2674\" />\r<br />\nTo save even more space, Apple is said to be equipping the iPhone 17 Air with a single rear camera. The company is also expected to remove the physical SIM card slot entirely, adopting eSIM-only support globally â€“ a shift first seen in U.S. iPhones with the iPhone 14.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne of the most interesting internal changes is the inclusion of Apple's new custom-designed C1 modem, first introduced in the iPhone 16e. The ultra-efficient chip should play a big role in maintaining battery life in such a thin frame. Despite its size, sources suggest the iPhone 17 Air will offer battery performance <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/\">on par with current iPhone models</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series during its usual fall event, which may also see the debut of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/airpods-pro-3-upgrades-worth-waiting-for/\">third-generation AirPods Pro</a>.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/iphone-17-air-usb-c-port-unusual-design-quirk/\">iPhone 17 Air USB-C Port May Have This Unusual Design Quirk</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-usb-c-port-may-have-this-unusual-design-quirk.2456230/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e094092b2dbce863499457b210cebba46e806283b8714261c56296868fcaa941","category":"Apple"}
