The drop in subscribers comes after Disney+ prices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/disney-raising-streaming-prices/\">increased in the fall</a>. Disney+ with Ads went from $7.99 to $9.99, while Disney+ Ad-Free went from $13.99 to $15.99.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/disney-crackdown-account-sharing-paid-plan/\">began cracking down</a> on Disney+ password sharing in September, introducing a \"Paid Sharing\" plan in the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe. The system restricts account usage to members of a single household, ending support for use across multiple households unless the primary subscriber pays an additional fee.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nQ1 2025 marked the first quarter where Disney+ lost subscribers since the service launched, but Disney CEO Bob Iger said during an earnings call discussing the results that the subscriber churn was not as bad as expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the second quarter of 2025, Disney expects Disney+ subscriptions to see another decline. While Disney+ subscriptions were down, Hulu gained 1.6 million subscribers, during the quarter, reaching 53.6 million total paid subscribers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney's overall revenue grew 4.8 percent during the quarter, largely thanks to Moana 2, which earned more than $1 billion in theaters.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/\">Hulu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/disney-plus-subscriber-decrease/\">Disney+ Loses 700,000 Subscribers Following Price Increase</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-loses-700-000-subscribers-following-price-increase.2448852/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b8819b1be8c2dc92c7310556ab819db66f465e91882d5a671dde120f46d1666","category":"Apple"}
