The Jersey Pine Barrens are an overlooked gem and are long overdue for a proper bikepacking route. This route has been thoughtfully crafted and is stewarded by Julian Bender of Philadelphia.⁠..</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSC05601.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSC05601.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSC05601.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/DSC05601.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>⁠<br />\nLast weekend, Bikepacking Roots Executive Director, Noelle Battle, joined Julian for the first thru-ride of the New Jersey Devil Hunt route that stretches 170 miles across the state.⁠ The best part? No car shuttling needed! The beginning and endpoint of the route are at train stations to connect you to Philadelphia via commuter rail – and further up &amp; down the East Coast via Amtrak.⁠</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>That’s right, the vast Pine Barrens, a wilderness the size of Yosemite National Park, are a true gem right in the heart of the East Coast metro region.⁠<br />\n</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Encounter the nature and history of the Pine Barrens, a truly unique ecoregion that feels like it belongs in a different part of the country. ⁠<br />\n</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Relax and swim at numerous rivers and lakes, enjoying the pristine “cedar water” of the Pine Barrens. ⁠<br />\n</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Pass through pine woods, cedar swamps, coastal marshes, and the barrier islands of the Jersey Shore. ⁠</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This route is very approachable for all experience levels. However, 2” tires or bigger are needed to handle the sand roads throughout the route.⁠</p>\n<p>⁠For more information on this route, see the <a href=\"https://bikepackingroots.org/project/the-jersey-devil-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\">route page</a>.
