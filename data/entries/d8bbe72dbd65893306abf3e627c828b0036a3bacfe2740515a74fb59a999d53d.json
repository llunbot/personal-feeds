The backpack can be tracked through the Items tab in the ‌Find My‌ app, right alongside <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a> and other trackers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a padded laptop compartment that fits laptops up to 15.6 inches in size, a main compartment for files and gear, a smaller pocket for accessories, and a quick-stash pocket at the front. It features a 22L capacity and a padded back panel for a comfortable fit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe included ‌Find My‌ location module uses a CR2032 battery much like an AirTag, and the battery should last up to 300 days depending on usage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTargus first announced the Find My-compatible backpack in November 2021 and showed it off at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2022/\">CES 2022</a>, and it appears to have taken well over a year for the accessory to actually launch. This is not the first ‌Find My‌ backpack on the market, as Hyper (owned by Targus) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/05/hyperpack-pro-find-my-backpack/\">also has a Find My-enabled backpack</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Cypress Hero Backpack can be <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-15197989?url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fproducts%2F15-6-cypress-hero-backpack-with-find-my-locator-tbb94104gl\">purchased from the Targus website</a> as of today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Targus.
