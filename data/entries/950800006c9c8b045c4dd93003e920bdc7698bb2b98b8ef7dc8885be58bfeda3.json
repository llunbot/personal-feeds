Sporting one of the smallest screens available (4.7-inch), it still manages to look a bit bulky due to the comparatively enormous top and bottom bezels. The lower one is to support the physical Home button, the last iPhone to have one, along with a Lightning port, Touch ID, and a mute switch. If you want any of these features, you’ll need to keep your iPhone SE.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone SE 2022 vs iPhone 13 SEHERO\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?resize=1200%2C674&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?resize=1536%2C863&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-SE-2022-vs-iPhone-13-SEHERO.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 16e isn’t based on the iPhone 6, but it’s not based on the iPhone 16 either. It’s something of a hybrid of old and new parts and is more in line with the design change Apple introduced with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234703/iphone-12-review.html\">iPhone 12</a>. The curved edges of the SE are gone and replaced with flatter, squared-off sides that offer a bit more grip.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16e main image\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 16e has a larger body compared to the SE, all to accommodate the 6.1-inch display. As such it’s also a little heavier. Here’s how the two devices compare in terms of size and weight:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone SE: </strong>138.4mm (5.45-inches), 67.3mm (2.65-inches), 7.3mm (0.29-inches); 144g (5.09 ounces)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16e:</strong> 146.7mm (5.78-inches), 71.5mm (2.82-inches), 7.8mm (0.31-inches); 167g (5.88 ounces)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the past two generations, the iPhone 16e drops the Lightning connector and moves to the move universal USB-C. There’s an extra button on the side that takes the spot of the mute switch: a customizable Action button that can instantly launch the camera, turn on the flashlight, silence the ringer, or do any number of other tasks. On the back, you’ll find a single camera lens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproofing gets an upgrade too, as the newer device features an IP68 rating compared to the SE’s IP67 rating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the 16e is available in black and white, while the SE was available in (Product) RED, Starlight, and Midnight.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"hand holding the iphone 16e with siri enabled\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-apple-intelligence.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 16e vs iPhone SE: Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious change with the 16e is a larger 6.1-inch screen that’s been standard on most iPhones for the past few years. Unlike the rest of the iPhone 16 line, you won’t get a Dynamic Island; rather there’s a notch at the top of the screen to accommodate the front camera, receiver, and Face ID sensors. The screen has also been upgraded to OLED over LCD, which will deliver crisper images and richer colors with deeper blacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new display is also brighter, with the maximum (typical) illumination reaching 800 nits, which bests the 625 nits of the SE. If you’re watching HDR content, peak brightness on the 16e tops out at 1,200 nits. (The iPhone SE doesn’t support HDR.) As expected, the overall resolution is higher as well, with the 16e offering 2,532 x 1,170 (460ppi) and the SE coming in at a lower 1,334 x 750 (326ppi).</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple iPhone 16e</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 16e\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-main-image.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16e\" target=\"_blank\">$599 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 16e vs iPhone SE: Processor and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE had the newest A15 Bionic chip when it launched in 2022, and the same is true of the iPhone 16e, which has Apple’s latest A18 processor. It’s slightly modified as compared to the iPhone 16, with a 6-core CPU (2 performance and 4 efficiency cores) and a 4-core GPU (versus 5 on the iPhone 16), but the A18 is still a fantastic chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 8GB of RAM onboard board, the A18 also opens up Apple Intelligence, the AI tools that come in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a>, which isn’t available on the SE. With this in mind, the 16e is a more future-proof option, with guaranteed updates for years to come and you won’t be missing out on the features Apple shouts loudest about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Storage options have changed as well, with Apple starting at 128GB on the 16e with 256GB and 512GB options. Apple charged an extra $50 for 128GB with the iPhone SE, so you’re getting a little extra value with the 16e. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also new on the iPhone 16e is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2618003/apple-iphone-c1-5g-modem-faq.html\">C1, Apple’s first in-house 5G modem</a>. On paper, the new phone supports the same wireless connectivity as the SE (4G/LTE and sub-6Ghz 5G), but Apple says the new modem is more efficient and helps in areas with spotty service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 16e vs iPhone SE: Camera</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In keeping with the entry-level offerings of the past, Apple’s iPhone 16e still has a single camera lens on the back. But it’s much improved over the 12Mp f/1.8 module in the SE. The iPhone 16e has a 48MP f/1.6 Fusion camera, matching the main camera in the iPhone 16. Apple calls it a 2-in-1 camera system, which means it will crop the 48Mp image to 24Mp to gain a 2x telephoto image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also get the addition of a Night Mode, Smart HDR 5, digital zoom up to 10x, and Apple’s photonic engine for better computational processing.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/videoframe_7766.png\" alt=\"iPhone 16e launch\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/videoframe_7766.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1080w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/videoframe_7766.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/videoframe_7766.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/videoframe_7766.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, the cameras share a lot of features – 4K/60fps video (although the 16e has support for Dolby Vision), Slo-mo video in 1080p/240fps, Time-lapse, optical image stabilization, True Tone flash, Deep Fusion, and various portrait and photography modes. In short, you’re getting an excellent everyday camera even if it just has a single lens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front camera also gets an upgrade, with the 7MP, f/2.2 sensor in the SE replaced with a 12MP, f/1.9 one in the 16e. The update also brings extra software processing and 4K video, as well as Night Mode and support for Animoji and Memoji. If you take a lot of selfies, then the 16e will certainly feel like an improvement.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Apple-iPhone-16e-USB-C-250219_inline.jpg.large_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 16e USB C 250219 inline jpg large\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Apple-iPhone-16e-USB-C-250219_inline.jpg.large_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 653w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Apple-iPhone-16e-USB-C-250219_inline.jpg.large_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Apple-iPhone-16e-USB-C-250219_inline.jpg.large_.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"653\" height=\"653\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 16e vs iPhone SE (2022): Battery and charging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important differences between the two devices comes in the battery department. With a smaller body and older tech, the iPhone SE struck a difficult balance between performance and battery life. It’s not bad, but if you use it often throughout the day, you’ll need a quick charge at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 16e is quite the opposite. By combining a larger battery with the efficiencies in the A18 chip and the C1 modem, the iPhone 16e boasts a 26-hour battery life, the longest over for a 6.1-inch iPhone. By comparison, Apple claimed the iPhone SE lasted for up to 15 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charing times are comparable, with support for fast charging up to 50 percent in around 30 minutes when using a 20W charger. Apple supplies a charging cable in the box, which is USB-C-to-USB-C now that Lightning is gone. Qi wireless is also available on both, though Apple didn’t include MagSafe charging on the iPhone 16e.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 16e vs iPhone SE (2022): Apple Intelligence and software support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of the iPhone 16e launch, both models were running iOS 18.3.1 and the iPhone SE will likely get iOS 19 in the fall. The iPhone SE should also receive iOS 20 in 2026 and iOS 21 in 2027 if Apple continues with its impressive record of supporting older devices for up to six years.

The main is Apple Intelligence, Apple’s suites of AI features, which requires an A18 processor and 8GB of RAM. Apple is rolliong out features throughout 2025 and will no doubt add even more Apple Intelligence features in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 19</a>, so if features like Genmoji, writing tools, ChatGPT, and the new, improved Siri interest you, you have to upgrade to the 16e. There will also surely be other features that aren’t supported by the iPhone SE 3 over the next couple of years, while the 16e is guaranteed to support the full slate of features for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 16e vs iPhone: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the launch of the iPhone 16e, Apple has discontinued the $429/£429 slot occupied by the iPhone SE. As of now, the iPhone 16e is the cheapest iPhone you can buy, starting at $599/£599 and available in the following configurations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16e 128GB: $599/£599</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16e 256GB: $699/£699</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16e 512GB: $899/£899</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that the iPhone SE had just 64GB of storage, so an apples-to-apples comparison is actually $479 vs $599. The $599 price is where the iPhone 14 sat in the line up before Apple discontinued that iPhone.

So, holding onto your iPhone SE is the best options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The increase in price for the 16e also makes it feel as though it’s aimed at a different market than its predecessor. The 16e is bigger and more expensive, but doesn’t quite offer the full experience of an iPhone 16. There’s no argument that it’s a superior device to the iPhone SE, with a larger display, faster performance, vastly improved battery life, and a better camers, it’s also a very different phone, which might not be what those looking for a 2025 version of the iPhone SE are looking for. But if you’re ready for a major change and to venture beyond the Home button, the iPhone 16e is a great phone, even if it’s no longer a great bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple iPhone SE (2022)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://pricespy-75b8.kxcdn.com/product/standard/800/6006821.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple iPhone SE (2022)\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"950800006c9c8b045c4dd93003e920bdc7698bb2b98b8ef7dc8885be58bfeda3","category":"Apple"}
