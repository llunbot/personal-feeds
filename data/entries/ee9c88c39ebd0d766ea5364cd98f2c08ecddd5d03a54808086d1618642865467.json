A refreshed selection of colors has accompanied every new ‌iPhone‌ model since then, featuring minor design refinements, such as the addition of aluminum buttons and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>. Rather than overtly discontinuing premium case options, it seems likely that Apple could replace leather with an alternative high-end material <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1692182425101595098\">that is vegan</a> and has a smaller carbon footprint.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-cases/\">iPhone Cases</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/9to5mac-com/\">9to5Mac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duanrui/\">DuanRui</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/\">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/apple-may-not-offer-leather-cases-for-iphone-15/\">Apple May Not Offer Leather Cases for iPhone 15 Lineup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-may-not-offer-leather-cases-for-iphone-15-lineup.2398895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee9c88c39ebd0d766ea5364cd98f2c08ecddd5d03a54808086d1618642865467","category":"Apple"}
