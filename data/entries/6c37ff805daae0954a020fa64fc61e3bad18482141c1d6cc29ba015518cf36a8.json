With the debut\nversion out now, you can add your favorite websites or choose from\nits suggestions, then swipe through the sites to see what’s new or\nshake the app for a surprise webpage when boredom strikes.</p>\n\n<p>The team says the idea initially struck them as something of a\njoke. But they soon realized the idea of a ‘swipeable,’ shakable\nweb browser that delivered our daily hits of dopamine may actually\nhave merit.</p>\n\n<p>“I mean, this is actually how I spend much of my time browsing the\nweb — I bounce back and forth mindlessly and semi-randomly\nbetween my favorite sites, hoping for something fresh.

I’m so glad to see that coming back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRojEWBw/\">This fun launch video on TikTok</a> — interrupted by a special guest.
