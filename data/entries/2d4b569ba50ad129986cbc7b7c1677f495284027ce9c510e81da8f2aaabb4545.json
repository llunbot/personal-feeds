That device has been previously reported to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apple-ar-headset-mac-level-computing/\">feature a processor</a> with Mac-level computing power and will be usable independent from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, according to Kuo. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHighlighting Apple's long-term goals in AR and the \"metaverse,\" Kuo said today that the development of the second generation of the headset is already underway and destined for launch in 2024. It will feature a lighter design compared to the first headset, as well as a new battery system, according to the analyst.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple has begun planning for the second-generation AR/MR headset, and the shipment schedule will likely be in 2H24. Improvements for the second generation include the lighter weight, form factor design, battery system, and processor compared to the first model, which will go to mass production in late 4Q22.</blockquote>In his note today, Kuo also shared some new details about the first generation of Apple's AR headset, including that it will weigh around 300 to 400g and that it will be able to \"seamlessly switch between AR and VR to provide an innovative headset experience.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's first AR headset is expected to be a somewhat niche product aimed largely towards developers with a focus on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/apple-headset-focus-on-gaming-media-communication/\">communication, media consumption, and gaming</a>. Apple's AR headset product line could ultimately <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/01/apple-planning-to-replace-the-iphone-in-10-years/\">replace the iPhone in 10 years</a>, according to Kuo. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first generation of Apple's AR headset is one of multiple new products Apple is expected to announce in 2022, including five new Macs, three new Apple Watches, updates to the ‌iPhone‌ lineup, and more.
