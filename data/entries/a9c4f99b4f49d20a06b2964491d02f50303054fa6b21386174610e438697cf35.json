In 2017, Apple acquired Workflow and, the following year, it was rebranded as \"Shortcuts.\" Shortcuts have since become a key part of Apple's ecosystem and can be used for a huge range of powerful, automated actions. Matthew was present at Workflow throughout its transition to Apple and now offers his own library of complex Shortcuts, which you can <a href=\"https://matthewcassinelli.com\">access over on his website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/\">report from <em>The Information</em></a> claimed that ‌iOS 18‌ will introduce some major AI features to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> and the Shortcuts app. Apple apparently wants ‌‌Siri‌‌ to be able to help users automate complex, multi-step tasks with voice-based commands and have much deeper integration with Shortcuts, such as by potentially helping users build them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe break down Apple Shortcuts for beginners and look at some of the many use-cases for the app, as well as consider where it could go next with AI. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> is now on <a
