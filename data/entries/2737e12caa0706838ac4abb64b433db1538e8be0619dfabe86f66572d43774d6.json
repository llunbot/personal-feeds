But after April 1, when all adults in both states were eligible for vaccination, a gap emerged in the rate of excess deaths between Republican and Democratic voters. Republicans had an excess death rate 7.7 percentage points higher than their blue counterparts, amounting to a 43 percent difference in the excess death rates.</p>\n<p>The study is just the latest to find a connection between <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00085\">political party affiliation and deaths during the pandemic</a>. But, it takes the connection a step further, going beyond county-level political leanings and looking at how party affiliation linked to deaths at the individual level. The authors—all researchers at Yale University—focused on Ohio and Florida because those were the only two states with readily available public data on voter registration.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956547#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956547&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2737e12caa0706838ac4abb64b433db1538e8be0619dfabe86f66572d43774d6","category":"Tech"}
