The collection includes iPhone and iPad wallpapers, an Apple Watch face, and a special-edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop watch band.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 Black Unity Collection incorporates the black, green, and red colors of the <a href=\"https://www.flagdb.com/pan-african\">Pan-African flag</a> in a theme of Unity Rhythm. The Black Unity Sport Loop is a woven band with a lenticular effect so that the loops in the band appear red on one side and green on the other. When the wearer’s wrist moves, yellow appears in the transition from green to red, “as if by magic.” The band is now available in the Apple Store for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MDF54AM/A/46mm-black-unity-sport-loop-unity-rhythm\">$49</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch band Black Unity Collection 2025\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-watch-black-unity-2025-band.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple Watch Black Unity Collection 2025 band.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To match the Black Unity Sport Loop, Apple offers the Unity Rhythm watch face, which has numerals of “intertwined threads of red, green, and yellow.” When the wearer raises the Watch to look at it, the threads transform from brush strokes to numbers. Also, the watch face has a rhythmic chime for every hour and half hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the iPhone and iPad, Apple offers Unity Rhythm wallpapers with red, green, and yellow letters that spell “Unity.” The wallpapers and watch face will be available in an upcoming software update. Apple recently released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/ios-18-3-release-date-beta-features-and-compatibility.html\">iOS and iPadOS 18.3 release candidate</a> and the watchOS 11.3 release candidate, so the OS updates with the Black Unity Collection could be released this week.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d512eb18761b6f9ab744fa248ff17497026531d9b50c35bc220d93b6859dbe94","category":"Apple"}
