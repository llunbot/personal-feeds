One sign that the Pi Foundation is feeling more confident about the stock situation: the launch of <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/2gb-raspberry-pi-5-on-sale-now-at-50/\">a new 2GB configuration of the Raspberry Pi 5</a>, available starting today for $50. That's $10 less than the 4GB configuration and $30 less than the 8GB version of the board.</p>\n<p>Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton writes that the 2GB version of the board includes a revised version of the Broadcom BCM2712C1 SoC that is slightly cheaper to manufacture. Upton says that the D0 stepping of the BCM2712C1 strips out some \"dark silicon\" built-in functionality that the Pi wasn't using but was still taking up space on the silicon die and increasing the cost of the chip.</p>\n\n<p>\"From the perspective of a Raspberry Pi user, [the chip] is functionally identical to its predecessor: the same fast quad-core processor; the same multimedia capabilities; and the same PCI Express bus that has proven to be one of the most exciting features of the Raspberry Pi 5 platform,\" Upton writes. \"However, it is cheaper to make, and so is available to us at somewhat lower cost. And this, combined with the savings from halving the memory capacity, has allowed us to take $10 out of the cost of the finished product.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043981#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043981&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6344e8e617b87c25c1e3d865019edf6e330c62c8608cd7e12347224c1763d68a","category":"Tech"}
