Plenty of keyboards and mice have come across the desks of our reviewers and editors, from mechanical models to the slew of low-profile keys that are attached to the decks of laptops and notebooks. A few notable picks even get our stamp of approval. But do our editors put their money where their fingers are?</p>\n<p>In the spirit of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/chairs-technica-where-your-favorite-ars-writers-park-their-rears/\">Chairs Technica</a>, we asked our staff members what they rely on to stay productive, game, and create content. Through the clickety-clacks of their typing, this is the gear our editors told us they swear by.</p>\n<h2>Eric Bangeman: Apple Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24-inch-iMac-keyboard-and-trackpad.jpeg\"><img alt=\"It's subtle, but this Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad combo matches the green iMac.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24-inch-iMac-keyboard-and-trackpad-640x419.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24-inch-iMac-keyboard-and-trackpad-1280x837.jpeg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24-inch-iMac-keyboard-and-trackpad.jpeg\">It's subtle, but this Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad combo matches the green iMac.</a> (credit: Samuel Axon)</p></div>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>Buy the setup                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <ul>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/45BDpQn\" target=\"_blank\">$190 Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and Number Pad at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MPteiK\" target=\"_blank\">$130 Apple Magic Keyboard TKL with Touch ID at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/43eIM6x\" target=\"_blank\">$99 Apple Magic Keyboard TKL at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oExdq9\" target=\"_blank\">$113 Apple Magic Trackpad at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                    </ul>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>Believe it or not, I love the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad.
