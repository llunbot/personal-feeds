Otherwise, if you’re thinking about making the switch, we’ve got a guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-set-up-road-tubeless-tyres/\">fitting tubeless tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Tubeless setup</h2>\n<p>When it comes to fitting tubeless tyres, sometimes you need a little extra oomph to get the bead seated onto the tubeless-ready rim. Often, a standard bike pump just won’t cut the mustard.</p>\n<p>This is where rapid air delivery comes in handy – and let’s face it, not everyone has access to an air compressor at home.</p>\n<h3>Topeak JoeBlow Tubi 2Stage</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Topeak’s JoeBlow Tubi 2Stage is designed to offer easy inflation for all types of tubeless tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Topeak JoeBlow Tubi 2Stage is designed to offer easy installation, whether you’re setting up high-volume tubeless <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike tyres</a>, or high-pressure <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">tubeless road tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>First up, the pump’s TubiHead device removes the Presta valve core, which allows you to rapidly get more air into the tyre.
