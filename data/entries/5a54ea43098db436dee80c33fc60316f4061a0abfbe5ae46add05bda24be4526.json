Starting in just a few weeks, the company plans to launch more than a dozen new products before the end of 2025, with nearly everything in its catalog getting a refresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a look at Apple’s plans based on the rumors so far:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>February</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air</a>:</strong> A minor refresh to the 13-inch and 15-inch models with an M4 chip and FaceTime camera.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>March</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE</a>:</strong> A major overhaul with a design based on the iPhone 14, an OLED display, and an A18 chip with Apple Intelligence support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">iPad 11</a>:</strong> Apple’s entry-level tablet gets a new chip and 8GB of RAM to allow it to run Apple Intelligence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad Air:</strong> Likely a simple spec bump that jumps the mid-range tablet straight to the M4.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>June</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">Mac Studio</a>:</strong> An overdue update to Apple’s mid-range desktop with M4 Max and M4 Ultra processors and Thunderbolt 5.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">Mac Pro</a>:</strong> We’d love to see the rumors of a smaller design come to fruition, but it will likely just get an upgrade to the M4 Ultra.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Studio Display: </strong>The design will likely stay the same but bring mini-LED backlighting and camera enhancements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pro Display XDR:</strong> Apple’s high-end monitor is due for an update to 120Hz ProMotion, possibly with Spatial Audio and a FaceTime camera as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>September</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a>:</strong> The iPhone will get a new design for the first time in years. This includes a new iPhone 17 Air model, which will be substantially thinner than the others.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple Watch Series 11:</strong> The new Apple Watch isn’t expected to deviate much from the design of the previous model but it could gain high blood pressure detection.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 3:</strong> The 3rd-gen Apple Watch Ultra will also have a similar design but will gain satellite connectivity and 5G RedCap network access.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple Watch SE 3:</strong> Apple’s cheaper watch will get a new look geared toward kids.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AirPods Pro 3:</strong> Apple’s high-end earbuds are due to get an update with a new shorter-stem design, H3 chip, and additional health features.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>October</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575929/apples-fall-launches-are-shaping-up-to-be-smarter-than-usual.html\">Smart home hub</a>:</strong> A brand-new device with an iPad-like display that can hang on a wall or rest on a counter.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>HomePod mini 2:</strong> An update to the 2020 model with a new chip and smart home functionality.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple TV 4K 4:</strong> Apple’s set-top will get a new chip and a renewed smart home focus.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>November</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2552098/m5-macbook-pro-design-processor-specs-release.html\">MacBook Pro</a>:</strong> Don’t expect much more than a bump to the M5 chip.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad Pro: </strong>Same as the MacBook Pro, expect an M5 processor and little else.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AirTag 2:</strong> Updated UWB chip and additional privacy protections.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a huge list, but you’ll notice one major product conspicuously absent: <strong>Vision Pro</strong>. While Apple’s headset was announced in 2023 and released in 2024, it’s not expected to get an update until later in 2026. The lower-cost model everyone is waiting for, meanwhile, might not arrive until 2027. And the glasses? Well, let’s just say you shouldn’t hold your breath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the only products not expected to get an update are the <strong>AirPods 4</strong> and <strong>AirPods Max</strong>, <strong>iPad mini</strong>, <strong>iMac</strong>, and <strong>Mac mini</strong>, all of which were just updated in the fall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">hold its first event</a> in March or April to announce the redesigned iPhone SE and 11th-gen iPad.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5a54ea43098db436dee80c33fc60316f4061a0abfbe5ae46add05bda24be4526","category":"Apple"}
