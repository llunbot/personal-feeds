Representing the peak of what the world’s leading component makers can achieve, theirs is a rivalry played out in bike shops and WorldTour races worldwide. SRAM Red AXS launched in 2024, while Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 arrived on the scene in 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter launch saw Shimano catch up with SRAM to offer 12-speed gearing along with a new semi-wireless operation. The update also saw Shimano definitively move away from mechanical shifting, meaning that the top of the market now belongs entirely to electronically operated groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM Red AXS offers an enhanced range of gearing options, including the ability to run ultra-wide cassettes alongside single chainrings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do the two groupsets stack up against one another?

Simultaneously pressing both paddles shifts the front derailleur. It’s about as idiot-proof as shifting gets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both SRAM and Shimano systems allow you to customise the function of the buttons in various ways, a feature best accessed via each maker’s app, although you can also reconfigure SRAM Red AXS via the latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\" target=\"_blank\">Hammerhead Karoo</a> cycling computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both SRAM and Shimano allow you to opt to have the groupset take care of front shifts for you. Creating a range of sequential gears, SRAM calls this ‘sequential shifting’ while Shimano calls it ‘synchronished shifting’ or ‘synchro’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both brands also offer a halfway-house option where the rider takes care of shifting both derailleurs, but the system adds in rear shifts to accompany the front, smoothing the progression between gears. SRAM calls this ‘compensating’ mode, while Shimano dubs it ‘semi-synchro’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the main combined shifters, both Dura-Ace and Red groupsets offer options for remote shifting. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002733/sram_wireless_blip_bars-970x555.jpg\" alt=\"sram_wireless_blip_bars\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM calls its remote buttons Blips. These were originally wired, but the brand has since launched <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-etap-axs-wireless-blips\" target=\"_blank\">wireless Blips</a>, which can be placed anywhere you like. You can have up to four pairs linked to your Red AXS groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003504/shimano-satellite-shifter-sw-rs801-t-primary_1_750_750.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano’s more diminutive satellite shifters are wired-only and come in ‘drops’ and ‘tops’ versions to suit different requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don’t choose to fit satellite shifters, both Dura-Ace and SRAM levers incorporate extra buttons on the lever body. These can assigned to perform shifting functions, or used to operate other devices such as a GPS head unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding ergonomics, the latest Dura-Ace hydraulic levers have actually increased in size. Now longer, fatter and taller, this reportedly comes at the request of Shimano’s pro riders. However, the need to also fit the new wireless components and replaceable battery inside may also have something to do with it. Either way, we found the new hoods to provide a comfortable, natural hand position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ditto the tweaked button positions and spacing. Now easier to activate from the drops, they follow Shimano’s established format by locating two paddles next to each other behind the brake lever blade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, SRAM’s latest levers have slimmed down, so that both SRAM and Shimano levers are now more similar in size than in their previous generations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Dura-Ace and Red have lever reach and bite-point (free stroke) adjustments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red gearing options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset chainset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although both groupsets have now gone 12-speed, gearing choice is one area where SRAM Red and Shimano Dura-Ace diverge dramatically. While Shimano offers a relatively traditional range of ratios and configurations, SRAM has some very clever tricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, it’s managed to shrink its smallest sprocket down to a minuscule ten teeth. A single tooth smaller than the smallest 11-tooth sprocket offered by Shimano, this innovation requires you to swap over to an XDR freehub, as the smaller diameter results in it not fitting on a more conventional Shimano/SRAM freehub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happily, this new freehub standard is an option for most existing wheels and opens up SRAM’s X-Range gearing. You can buy a replacement XDR freehub for many wheelsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This series of slightly shrunken double cranksets and matching cassettes includes 50/37, 48/35, 46/33, and 43/30 options that can be paired to cassettes as wide as 10-36t. Leveraging the smaller sprocket, they provide for a broader range of gears and lighter components. SRAM now offers four different Red cassette options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They should also allow most riders to cut down on unnecessary shifting by helping them spend more time in the big chainring.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003518/sram-xplr-axs-970x647.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big news is SRAM’s range of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-zipp-and-rockshox-unite-to-launch-xplr-gravel-component-family\" target=\"_blank\">XPLR components</a>. These gravel-specific components allow riders to employ phenomenally wide-ratio cassettes of up to 10-44 alongside single-chainring cranksets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available to select when purchasing or retrofitting later, these parts expand the groupset’s appeal beyond pure road riding. Regardless of whether you opt for a standard or XPLR-type rear derailleur, you’ll also benefit from SRAM’s hydraulic Orbit fluid damping technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This clutch-like mechanism stops the derailleur arm from swinging around over rough terrain and should help your chain remain in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/02235122/shimano_dura-ace_9200_review_01-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, Shimano’s Dura-Ace groupset opts for more familiar technology with a range of 12-speed cassettes that can slip straight onto your existing freehub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just two 11-30 and 11-34 cassette options supported by a single rear derailleur, this simplified range still offers much more consumer-friendly gearing than previous versions of the groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, twin the largest of the two cassettes to a 50/34 compact crankset, and you’ll get a very low and free-spinning 1:1 ratio, meaning you won’t need pro-level fitness to make it over the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Shimano has introduced a new 54/40 chainring combination. Replacing the 53/39 setup traditionally favoured by racers, it provides enormous gears and should be a hit with pros and aspiring pros alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red braking</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003522/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-rear-brake-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"shimano-dura-ace-r9200-rear-brake-1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Shimano Dura-Ace still offers traditional rim brakes, most riders are now likely to be using disc brakes. (Evidence of this includes the fact that Shimano’s cable operated 12-speed levers are just a rehash of the old 11-speed units rather than a totally new product like its disc brake compatible models). There are relatively few premium road bikes that still offer a rim brake option, with many of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">best road bikes</a> now available only with disc brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won’t find stopping power lacking with either brand, but they do dole out their braking force somewhat differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano brakes tend to have more of a defined bite point while SRAM’s come on more subtly. SRAM’s 2024 upgrade has changed the lever geometry, so that braking requires an even lighter touch, with SRAM claiming it can be achieved with a single digit. Both systems are easily powerful enough to stop the bike regardless of the conditions and the choice comes down to personal taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset brakes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-14.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for keen home mechanics, Shimano might have the edge, if only because its mineral oil braking fluid is less corrosive and better for the environment than the DOT fluid used by SRAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Shimano and SRAM have increased the brake pad clearance with their latest groupsets, so that with the pistons retracted, disc rub may be  marginally less likely if you have a slightly bent rotor, or grit gets into a calliper.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red looks and design</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003531/shimano_dura-ace_9200_review_02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_dura-ace_9200_review_02\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Primarily down to personal preference, it’s hard to think either groupset looks anything other than lovely. With its super compact cranksets, distinctive flattop chain, and chunky derailleurs, SRAM’s is undoubtedly the more radical stylistically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, Shimano’s Dura-Ace could almost be mistaken for a mechanical groupset, particularly given you still need to wire the derailleurs to the central battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absence of wiring to the levers does mean the system is now a bit slicker than its predecessor was, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset rear derailleur\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-8.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aesthetically, both groupsets are pretty angular. On Shimano’s components, finishing is more universally glossy, while SRAM opts for a pleasant mix of polished and matte finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red battery life, apps and everyday practicality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another critical point of difference between the systems is how they’re powered. In opting for a completely wireless system, SRAM prioritises ease of installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its design sees both the front and rear derailleurs powered by their own batteries, each of which clips directly onto the back of the derailleur itself. These power packs should then be good for around 60 hours of riding before needing to be recharged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Detaching easily from the parts they power, this makes them straightforward to bring indoors for charging, and if one derailleur goes flat before the other, you can swap the batteries around to eke out a few more shifts. The coin cells in the levers meanwhile should last for around two years of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003547/shimano_di2_app.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, Shimano uses one central battery to power both derailleurs, with wiring running through the frame to the battery mounted in the seatpost or, increasingly, elsewhere in the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charging is via a port on the rear derailleur and you’ll need to bring the entire bike inside to replenish its battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano reckons you’ll get around 1,000km of riding from the central battery, while the coin cells in the levers should last 1.5 to 2 years, numbers that are pretty similar to SRAM’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano users keen to boost their run times further can also opt to wire the shifters directly to the battery unit. Shimano claims doing so will increase run time by 50%, making it a good option for forgetful people or those going on long tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003548/sram_app-970x646.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time, SRAM has been ahead of Shimano regarding connectivity. The latest Dura-Ace groupset remedies this by now connecting directly with your phone without requiring additional hardware or wires. Letting you assign buttons and check on other aspects of performance, SRAM’s AXS app does the same thing for its parts and features slightly better graphics and you can also configure your Red AXS groupset using the new Hammerhead Karoo cycling computer. Both apps are compatible with iOS and Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no standard method for weighing groupsets so it’s difficult to offer a true apples-to-apples comparison between Red AXS and Dura-Ace R9200, particularly given their differing options for gearing and accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, manufacturers have got better at providing meaningful numbers, and both Shimano and SRAM have a fairly good track record of providing accurate weights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, exact numbers vary depending who you listen to, but Sram is confident it has reclaimed the lightest groupset mantle with Red AXS, claiming it comes in 66g lighter than Dura-Ace for an equivalent setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the two manufacturers divvy up the weight differently, with SRAM’s carbon crankset being lighter than Shimano’s aluminium model but Shimano’s shifters being lighter than SRAM’s. Unsurprisingly, both groupsets represent the most lightweight parts each manufacturer makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red price and running costs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003550/sramredetap12speed3-970x646.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In launching their respective groupsets, SRAM and Shimano expected to test the maximum people were prepared to pay. After all, both represent the pinnacle of the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then along came a global pandemic, supply chain shortages, inflation, and massive currency fluctuations. Now they’re not just expensive; they’re really expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might be the reason that both brands have hedged their bets by including almost exactly the same technology on their second-tier <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-force-axs-review\" target=\"_blank\">Force </a>and Ultegra groupsets, both of which have more sensible price tags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you must have the finest components available to humanity, the current cost of SRAM’s Red AXS groupset in a twin-chainring format with a power meter is £4,000. The equivalent Dura-Ace set-up from Shimano is listed at around £4,100.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003553/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-cassette-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"shimano-dura-ace-r9200-cassette-1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s move on to the ongoing service costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, Shimano undercuts SRAM. A SRAM Red 12-speed cassette starts at £390 (or £450 in a rainbow finish), £60 more than Shimano’s at £330. Chains come in at £60 for Shimano and £90 for SRAM. Fall off and ruin your rear derailleur, and both Shimano and SRAM will want £700 for a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One area where the two diverge significantly is for those employing either groupsets’ matching power meter. Because SRAM has integrated its sensors into the chainring, it’s a disposable part and replacing these becomes more expensive. By comparison, Shimano’s crank-based system involves no consumable parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red: Which is better?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are both outstanding groupsets that deserve to be on the very best bikes. All things considered it’s hard to say which is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being completely wireless, SRAM’s Red groupset is incredibly user-friendly. Its one-button-per-lever operation also makes a lot of sense, while it also features the most comprehensive range of gearing options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we think Shimano’s Dura-Ace groupset still has a slight edge in terms of shifting. It’s not as versatile as Red but, as a pure road racing product, it’s hard to beat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to weight SRAM wins, but by such a small margin we wouldn’t really factor it into our decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano wins on cost. Battery life is comparable, but Shimano can boost its significantly by forgoing its wireless functionality. A trick SRAM does without; it’s nevertheless neater for managing without any electrical cables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, personal taste plays a significant role and you should choose the groupset whose ergonomics, shifting arrangements, gearing options and aesthetics you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss our full <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS 12-speed groupset review</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200 12-speed groupset review</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Need more help with groupsets?
