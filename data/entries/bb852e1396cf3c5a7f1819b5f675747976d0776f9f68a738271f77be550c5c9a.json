The implant came in the form of firmware images for TP-Link routers. The well-written C++ code, however, took pains to implement its functionality in a “firmware-agnostic” manner, meaning it would be trivial to modify it to run on other router models.</p>\n<h2>Not the ends, just the means</h2>\n<p>The main purpose of the malware appears to relay traffic between an infected target and the attackers’ command and control servers in a way that obscures the origins and destinations of the communication. With further analysis, Check Point Research eventually discovered that the control infrastructure was operated by hackers tied to Mustang Panda, an advanced persistent threat actor that both the <a href=\"https://decoded.avast.io/threatintel/apt-treasure-trove-avast-suspects-chinese-apt-group-mustang-panda-is-collecting-data-from-burmese-government-agencies-and-opposition-groups/\">Avast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/03/02/mqsttang-mustang-panda-latest-backdoor-treads-new-ground-qt-mqtt/\">ESET</a> security firms say works on behalf of the Chinese government.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939749#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939749&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bb852e1396cf3c5a7f1819b5f675747976d0776f9f68a738271f77be550c5c9a","category":"Tech"}
