SharePlay Screen Sharing lets users take control of another person's screen while using the SharePlay feature, with the aim of providing assistance. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome of the Siri-related Apple Intelligence capabilities <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-siri-improvements-coming-2025/\">will not be launching</a> until 2025, but Genmoji, Image Playground, Writing Tools, and many new in-app capabilities are set to be available starting in September, and these are what ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, and Mac users in the European Union will miss out on. It is not clear how long it will take Apple to expand this features to the EU, nor what changes Apple might have to make to introduce them under the DMA.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's warning comes as the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-dma-issues-eu-rule-enforcement-soon/\">prepares to make a ruling</a> on whether prior changes to allow for app marketplaces meet the terms of the DMA. Regulators have said that there are \"very serious\" issues with Apple's implementation, likely related to the Core Technology Fee that Apple is charging. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/\">Apple Intelligence Features Not Coming to European Union at Launch Due to DMA</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-features-not-coming-to-european-union-at-launch-due-to-dma.2429759/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c767a6638876ab458e8927e4aead8ef4986a51bed983aac791dbf5119ef4c692","category":"Apple"}
