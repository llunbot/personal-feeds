There are days when I wish I got less love and more wins,’ he revealed in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/netflix-unchained-review\" target=\"_blank\">‘Tour de France: Unchained’ documentary</a> released last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fans came out in force in Bergamo for his final race, as well as lining the roads on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thibaut-pinot-tour-de-france-2023-stage-20\" target=\"_blank\">Stage 20 of this year’s Tour</a>, which was his real last hurrah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His solo ascent to the top of Le Petit Ballon rolled back the years and while he couldn’t hold off eventual stage winner Tadej Pogačar and the yellow jersey group, he crossed the line in a very respectable seventh place. To the crowds of boozed-up Ultras cheering him on he may as well have won it, anyway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over his career Pinot won stages at all three Grand Tours as well as third step on the overall podium and best young rider at the Tour in 2014. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly a decade later he was King of the Mountains at the Giro d’Italia in 2023, rounding off a storied career in style. He’ll now enjoy the quiet life on his farm in the Vosges region while French Grand Tour hopes pass on to the new generation including Groupama-FDJ teammate Lenny Martinez. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/5-best-thibaut-pinot\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist’s 5 favourite Thibaut Pinot moments</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Annemiek van Vleuten</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4-970x946.jpg\" alt=\"annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4-970x946.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4-300x293.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4-768x749.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4-1536x1498.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4-750x732.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4-1140x1112.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/02181435/annemiek_van_vleuten_profile_4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch superstar Annemiek van Vleuten has had a remarkable career that few – if any – will be able to surpass. Her list of achievements could fill a book: 104 UCI wins on the road, mountain bike and in time-trials, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Strade Bianche, and the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cruised to an astonishing five Giro d’Italia Donne victories, three at La Vuelta Femenina (consecutively, in its changing form), and the Tour de France Femmes, doing the calendar triple in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fourth place at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\" target=\"_blank\">this year’s Tour de France Femmes</a> was a disappointing result for her but in no way negates a career few could even dream of. The list goes on: European Championships gold and the double of World Championships road and time-trial golds – twice. Oh, and Olympic time-trial gold in Tokyo 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Vleuten’s last major race was the 2023 TdFF, where onlookers witnessed a changing of the guard as compatriot Demi Vollering came of age and blew the field to pieces to win. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll be strange seeing a start line without Van Vleuten’s presence, but it’s nice of her to give some other riders a chance…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/cyclists-31-inspirational-women-no3-annemiek-van-vleuten\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women: Annemiek van Vleuten</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Peter Sagan</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/04/02111839/peter_sagan_tinkoff-1-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"peter_sagan_tinkoff-1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/04/02111839/peter_sagan_tinkoff-1-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/04/02111839/peter_sagan_tinkoff-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/04/02111839/peter_sagan_tinkoff-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/04/02111839/peter_sagan_tinkoff-1-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/04/02111839/peter_sagan_tinkoff-1.jpg 800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s almost impossible to imagine a Tour de France without Peter Sagan, either omnipresent in green during the mid-2010s or otherwise livening up the peloton with wheelies on Alpe d’Huez. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagan will call time on road racing at the end of this year, although he’ll still be in action on the mountain bike, where he started as a junior and plans to finish his senior career, aiming for the Paris Olympics next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slovakian won a record seven points classifications at the Tour de France – five in a row from 2012 to 2016 – as well as eighteen Grand Tour stages, his fair share of Classics including the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, and even the general classification at the Tour of California. And of course he won three World Championships in a row, an unbelievable feat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His <em>palmarès</em> is all the more impressive for his sprinting successes in an era largely dominated by the likes of Mark Cavendish, Marcel Kittel and Andre Greipel.

including beating Rafał Majka and Jakob Fulgsang in a three-man sprint for 2016 Olympic Road Race gold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He held his own in stage races and Grand Tours – wearing the yellow jersey in
