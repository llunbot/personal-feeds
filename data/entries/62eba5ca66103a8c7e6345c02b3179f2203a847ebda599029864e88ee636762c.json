The UCI Cycling World Championships absolutely is: 11 days, 13 disciplines, 120 countries and 8,000 riders each vying for the rainbow bands in their specialist event. So where do you even begin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well there’s the road race of course, and the time-trial, and they’re going to be good. Geraint Thomas should be there, Lizzie Deignan, Fred Wright, Elynor Backstedt… maybe even Cav if he recovers in time. But to seek out only these events is to miss out on the incredible. Because cycling is a very broad church, and within its congregation incredible athletes doing frankly insane things, from hucking 20-metre gaps to dancing on two wheels. So while this list is far from exhaustive, here are our top picks for events you really can’t afford to miss.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hope-lotus-track-bike-team-gb-2023\">The even weirder new Hope-Lotus track bike has a split seatpost and serrated fork</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Glasgow UCI Cycling World Championships 2023: Key information</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/inside-the-secretive-world-of-the-derny-pacer\">Inside the secretive world of the derny pacer</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>1. Artistic cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> If a WorldTour rider ran away to join the circus then ran away again to join the ballet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 11th-13th August</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you do a wheelie? OK, how about can you do a wheelie with no hands? OK, how about can you do a wheelie with no hands, pedalling backwards with your mate on your shoulders with their arms out? In which case, you need to sign up to your local Artistic Cycling club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As two-wheeled sports go, this is an impressive one, with riders competing solo, in pairs or in teams over five-minute rounds, a bit like gymnastics, where they attempt to pull off as many mind-blowing tricks as they can to score highly with the judges. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bikes are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-single-speed-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">fixed-wheel</a> with upside-down bars and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-bike-geometry-handling\" target=\"_blank\">near zero trail</a>, because that all helps when you want to go up into a handstand while moving in faster, ever deceasing circles. And just to add to the fun, it’s all set to music, so cue the rousing classical meets Europop mash-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Para-Track Tandem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> Breakneck speed tandem racing with blind or visually impaired ‘stoker’ and sighted ‘pilot’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 3rd-8th August, various times</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The para-cycling designation ‘B’ marks out any event ridden by blind or visually impaired cyclists on a tandem bike, with the para-athlete on the back in position of ‘stoker’ and the sighted rider on the front in the position of ‘pilot’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speeds two humans can travel on a bicycle made for two are in excess of 75kmh, and the spectacle will leave you wondering just how the tandems themselves don’t twist in half. This Worlds sees three B discipline races in both women’s and men’s events, the B 1km time-trial (aka, the kilo), B Individual Pursuit and B Sprint, where a cat and mouse start crescendos in a maximum velocity finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look out for Team GB’s Lora and Neil Fachie – Olympic gold medallist and road and track world champ Lora back competing after the birth of her son and her 16-time track world champion and Olympic gold medallist husband Neil out to defend his 2022 rainbow stripes. Spoiler: the Brits are pretty good at this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Mountain Bike Downhill</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> Riding downhill very, very fast on a mountain bike. Plus Evel Knievel-level jumps</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 3rd-5th August, various times</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all the events at the UCI World Champs, the mountain bike downhill is arguably closest to Scotland’s heart. The track is one of the oldest downhill courses in the world, bowling its way down the side of Aonach Mòr in the shadow of Ben Nevis into the town of Fort William, 547 vertical metres below. At 2.9km it’s also the longest downhill course in the MTB World Cup calendar, but that’s not the only reason it’s widely considered one of the hardest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strewn with granite rocks, boggy woods, huge drop and gaps and potentially horrendous weather, Fort Bill has seen its fair share of thrills and spills and this UCI Worlds will be no different. There’s not a part of the track not to like, but keep an eye out for the Motorway section, a long straight of massive, flowing hip and tabletop jumps just near the end. Also keep an eye out for British riders Rachel Atherton (seven-time world champ) and junior champ Phoebe Gale, making her elite Worlds debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side note: if you want to see one of our own, Team Ineos Grenadier’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a> will be riding – and quite possibly winning – the men’s cross country (XC) MTB. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tom-pidcock-descending-safa-brian\" target=\"_blank\">He’s pretty handy</a> on just about anything with wheels…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Trials</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> Hopping about things that belong on building sites on what look like very long children’s bikes</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 9th-12th August, various times</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If downhill racing is like hockey with balls of flaming petrol, Trials is more like chess with pieces that might explode. It’s a relatively slow burn affair, as much in the calculations of the head as the body, but as riders size up the obstacles they must hop up or drop off, picking their lines with the skill of a rock climber, the heart-in-mouth moments come thick and fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each run is two minutes long and sees riders jump, hop or hook (getting a front wheel up first then forcing the rear wheel up and under the body) their way over giant concrete blocks, metal gantries and huge cotton reels. The idea is to complete within the time, but moreover to do so ‘clean’, that is without falling off or putting down a foot (called a dab). Such things incur penalties, which don’t win prizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Handcycling Mixed Team Relay</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> Teams of three handcyclists relay race around Glasgow city centre</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 13th August, 10.45am</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is really very simple: three handcyclists, three laps of a 15.3km course in the centre of Glasgow. Only the three riders are on the same team, the race is a relay format and as such this one’s all about communication and swift changes as it is about brute hand-cranking power. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first time handcyclists will represent Team GB in a world champs mixed relay, so Claire Danson, Nick Beighton, Luke Jones and Alex-Brooke Turner will have everything to prove.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. BMX Freestyle Flatland</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> Like ballroom dancing but in a skatepark and your partner is a BMX</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 8th-10th August, various times</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Artistic Cycling is the older sister that got 11 A*s at GCSE, BMX Freestyle is the delinquent little brother who hasn’t been to maths all term. That’s because he’s been too busy hanging out in a car park on his BMX, pulling wheelies, spinning bars and generally sort of ‘walking’ and jumping over his bike as it rolls around, in a manner the UCI promo-lit calls ‘parkour combined with breakdancing’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, Flatland takes the format of a two three-minute runs in front of judges, who assess things such as bike control, trick difficulty and flow. The tricks are varied, beguiling, deeply technical and hard to explain, but some <em>Cyclist</em> favourites – just for their names – are the Switzerland squeaker (rolling backwards on the front wheel, rear wheel skyward and dragging the front wheel back with the foot) and the perverted boomerang – much like an inverted boomerang, obviously, only with feet moving from back pegs, over the head tube to frame and pedals. OK, perhaps you better just watch BMX Freestyle Flatland on telly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. BMX Freestyle Park</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> The ‘how did the hell did they do that?’ of bike sport, think big airs and triple backflips</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 5th-7th August, various times</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all the disciplines listed here, BMX Freestyle Park proves without a doubt that cycling is an evolving creature. In 1989 Mat Hoffman landed the first ever 900 on a BMX, a 900° rotation in the air on a vert ramp; last year Red Bull athlete Kieran Reilly landed the first ever BMX Triple Flair, a triple backflip finishing in a 180° rotation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while Downhill might be fastest or Flatland the most technical or Tandem Track the most explosive, BMX Freestyle Park is by far and away the most creatively… insane. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously, this is a discipline that defies words as well as gravity and common sense. And what’s also wonderful is we’re really quite good at it – Reilly just happens to be British and reigning European Champ, so too women’s Freestyle Park hopeful, Charlotte Worthington, the first woman ever to pull off a 360° Backflip in competition, and gold medal winner at Tokyo 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Cycle-Ball</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What: </strong>Football crossed with cycling</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 11th-13th August, various times</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This couldn’t be easier to understand, nor more fun to watch. Riders pass, dribble and shoot a football by hitting it with their bikes (mainly flicking it with the front wheel), and the most goals wins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hang on, what’s this, headers are allowed too? And goalies can use their hands which often means diving off their bikes? And if you touch the floor with your foot, you have to leave and re-enter the pitch? And the goals are like hockey goals? And the bike seats are right over the rear wheel and the handlebars are more like ski poles? And no-one wears helmets and everyone rides into each other all the time? And this sport has been played for more than a century?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Keirin</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What:</strong> Impossible to understand what’s going on, but it’s track racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 8th-10th August, various times</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s never quite clear if anyone actually knows what’s happening in Keirin, but someone always wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Don’t miss our big guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">2023 UCI World Championship road races</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Main image: Thomas Kienzle via Getty</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-worlds-what-to-watch\">Glasgow World Champs: 9 weird and wonderful events you need to watch</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Matthew Loveridge &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"62eba5ca66103a8c7e6345c02b3179f2203a847ebda599029864e88ee636762c","category":"Cycling"}
