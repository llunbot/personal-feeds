Support for the sixth-generation iPad, which uses the regular A10 Fusion chip, is also being dropped. However, iPadOS 18 will continue to work on the seventh-generation iPad, according to the source. \r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 18 will therefore be compatible with the following iPad models:<ul><li>iPad Pro: 2018 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad Air: 2019 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad mini: 2019 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad: 2019 and later</li></ul>Apple is expected to announce iPadOS 18 alongside iOS 18 at its Worldwide Developers Conference, which begins June 10, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPad in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to introduce a slew of AI-related features, collectively dubbed \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-intelligence-service-wwdc/\">Apple Intelligence</a>,\" but only iPads powered by an M1 chip or later will support on-device AI capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also plans to introduce a built-in Calculator app for the iPad with iPadOS 18. The app will be a \"universal\" app able to run on the iPhone, iPad, and macOS, allowing for a similar look and function across all three devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo kick off WWDC 2024, Apple will hold a keynote event on Monday at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time to announce the new software.
