It joins the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">13-inch MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/791082/13-inch-macbook-pro-m2-review.html\">13-inch MacBook Pro</a>, and 14-inch and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480214/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-pro-review.html\">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> as the newest laptops sporting the newest chips. There’s just one problem: Apple appears to have forgotten the 13-inch MacBook Pro exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a slide during the WWDC keynote, Apple showed a picture of the Mac lineup following the completion of the transition to Apple silicon: the Mac Pro, iMac, Mac Studio, and Mac mini, alongside the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. Conspicuously absent from the rendering are the 13-inch MacBook Pro and M1 MacBook Air. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple VP John Ternus talks Macs at WWDC23\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?resize=1536%2C865&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?resize=2048%2C1153&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ternus-macs-wwdc23.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>The Mac slide during the WWDC keynote was missing something.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense to exclude the Air from the image since it’s two and a half years old. But the 13-inch Pro? What gives? The only explanation is that Apple doesn’t actually think anyone will buy it, which is basically true. With the 13-inch MacBook Air’s price cut to $1,099, it’s now $200 less than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a similar processor, better screen, and newer design. And for the same $1,299, you can get a bigger and better screen with the 15-inch MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t understand why Apple updated the 13-inch MacBook Pro last year when it launched the redesigned MacBook Air with an M2 processor, and I understand it even less now. It has a slower processor than the other MacBook Pros, a smaller screen than either of the MacBook Airs and a six-year-old design. Even if you really love the Touch Bar, there are many more reasons to buy a different M2 MacBook. And Apple appears to think the same as us: There’s no reason for the 13-inch MacBook Pro to exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are reports that Apple still plans on updating the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 processor in 2024. Maybe it will. But Apple needs to remember it exists first.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"efdf017963dd4578d4abbb9b98d80b2146704aaef665f04bf8df36f4b10223b8","category":"Apple"}
