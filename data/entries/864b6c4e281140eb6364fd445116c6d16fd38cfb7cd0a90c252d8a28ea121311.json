These “dapps” allow people to sign smart contracts that, in theory, operate autonomously in executing currency trades among two or more parties when certain agreed-upon conditions are met.</p>\n<p>The backdoor came in the form of code that collected private keys and wallet addresses when apps that directly handled private keys incorporated solana-web3.js versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7. These backdoored versions were available for download during a five-hour window between 3:20 pm UTC and 8:25 pm UTC on Tuesday.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/backdoor-slips-into-popular-code-library-drains-155k-from-digital-wallets/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/backdoor-slips-into-popular-code-library-drains-155k-from-digital-wallets/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"864b6c4e281140eb6364fd445116c6d16fd38cfb7cd0a90c252d8a28ea121311","category":"Tech"}
