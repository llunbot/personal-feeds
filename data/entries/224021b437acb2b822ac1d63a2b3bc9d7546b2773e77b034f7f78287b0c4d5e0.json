In July, the automaker is deploying some of its I<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/weve-driven-volkswagens-retro-cool-id-buzz-electric-minivan/\">D. Buzz electric vans</a> to the city, outfitted with Mobileye's autonomous driving tech to start a three-year pilot program. However, unlike in Germany, VW has no plans to build its own ride hailing service here; instead, it's developing autonomous ID. Buzzes for use by fleets. Back in 2016—before the ID. Buzz was even the ID. Buzz—VW <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/ridesharing-and-cleaner-quieter-transport-volkswagens-answer-is-called-moia/\">created a new brand ride-hailing company called Moia</a>, which has been testing autonomously driven electric vans on the streets of Hamburg for several years now.</p>\n<p>Things have not gone entirely smoothly. In 2019 VW Group <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/ford-vw-alliance-means-more-evs-for-europe-joint-argo-ai-investment/\">invested $2.6 billion in Argo AI</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup backed by Ford. At the time, Argo's self-driving stack was to be incorporated into future autonomous VWs as well as autonomous Fords. But Ford's original timeline of launching a commercial level 4 autonomous vehicle ride-hailing service by 2021 fell by the wayside, and in October last year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/argo-ai-will-cease-operations-as-ford-and-volkswagen-pull-investments/\">VW and Ford decided to shutter Argo</a>, just a month after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/29/argo-ais-robotaxis-officially-available-via-lyft-in-austin/\">started offering autonomous ride hailing with Lyft</a>.</p>\n<p>At the time, VW said it was consolidating its autonomous driving research activities, including programs with Bosch in Europe and Horizon Robotics in China.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951900#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951900&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
