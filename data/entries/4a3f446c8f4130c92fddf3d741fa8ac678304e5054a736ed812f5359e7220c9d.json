{"title":"iPhone SE 3 Rumored to Feature iPhone XR Design With Touch ID and Be Apple's Last LCD Smartphone","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/iphone-se-3-feature-xr-design-touch-id-last-lcd/","date":1634901440000,"content":"Apple's third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> will feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> XR-like design with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> and be the company's last ‌iPhone‌ with an LCD display, according to Chinese site <em><a href=\"https://news.mydrivers.com/1/790/790144.htm\">MyDrivers</a></em>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/iphone-se-3-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA machine translation of the report explains that the design of the third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is based on the ‌iPhone‌ XR, and will feature a ‌Touch ID‌ fingerprint scanner built into the side button, as well as an LCD display, the A15 Bionic chip, and 5G connectivity. The report noted that the device is expected to be Apple's final ‌iPhone‌ with an LCD display, with future iPhones moving to OLED or other, more advanced display technologies.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>MyDrivers</em> acknowledged that this assertion stands in contrast to other recent claims that the third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ would continue with the design of the current, second-generation model. The ‌iPhone SE‌ currently shares the same design as the now-discontinued ‌iPhone‌ 8, with a ‌Touch ID‌ scanner built into the Home Button.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors around the design of the next ‌iPhone SE‌ have been muddled, with rumors from reliable sources such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-13-lineup-rumored-120hz-iphone-se-3-2022/\">Ross Young</a> initially saying that the device would feature a 6.1-inch display like the ‌iPhone‌ XR, but with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/\">Touch ID side button</a>. This year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/\">Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-se-2023-hole-punch-design/\">Young</a> withdrew these expectations, saying that the third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ would instead have the same design as the current model with a Home Button.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the confusion around the ‌iPhone SE‌ may be explained by the 6.1-inch ‌iPhone SE‌ potentially being the fourth-generation model. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-se-2023-hole-punch-design/\">Young expects</a> a fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ to launch in 2023, featuring a 6.1-inch display and a hole-punch front-facing camera.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>MyDrivers</em> said that the third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ will reportedly launch in the spring of 2022, and start with 64GB of storage and the same $399 starting price of the current model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>MyDrivers</em> has a mixed track record. Although the site erroneously suggested that the ‌iPhone‌ 7 Plus would actually be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/02/29/iphone-7-plus-dual-cameras-iphone-pro/\">called the \"iPhone Pro\"</a> and the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> would come out <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/19/ipad-air-4-launch-march-2021/\">in March 2021</a>, it correctly predicted that the ‌iPhone‌ 7 would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/02/iphone-7-plus-256gb-storage-3100-mah-battery/\">available with up to 256GB</a> of storage, that third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> would contain a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/15/2018-ipad-pro-octa-core-a11x-chip-rumor/\">7nm chip with eight cores</a>, and that the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/19/ipad-air-4-launch-march-2021/\">iPad Air would feature</a> a larger display, the A14 Bionic chip, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a> with Magic Keyboard support, a USB-C port, and stereo speakers.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE 2020</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mydrivers-com/\">mydrivers.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/iphone-se-3-feature-xr-design-touch-id-last-lcd/\">iPhone SE 3 Rumored to Feature iPhone XR Design With Touch ID and Be Apple's Last LCD Smartphone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-3-rumored-to-feature-iphone-xr-design-with-touch-id-and-be-apples-last-lcd-smartphone.2318628/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=L6AgPgXbmN0:w1ibQI4xcOI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=L6AgPgXbmN0:w1ibQI4xcOI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/L6AgPgXbmN0\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4a3f446c8f4130c92fddf3d741fa8ac678304e5054a736ed812f5359e7220c9d","category":"Apple"}
