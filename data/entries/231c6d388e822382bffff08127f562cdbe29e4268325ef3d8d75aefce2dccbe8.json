The company finally made a phone that feels like a full-effort flagship device. It took six long, frustrating years, but with the Pixel 6 it finally feels as though Google isn't holding back out of concern for its Android licensees or some other commitment issue. The Pixel 6 has a custom Google SoC, tons of AI software features that really work, and a new and exciting version of Android. These combine into the best Android smartphone out there—the One True Flagship of the Android ecosystem. With a great price, the Pixel 6 is an easy \"buy\" recommendation.</p>\n<p>That's <em>if</em> you can buy one. The one negative thing you can say about the Pixel 6 is that Google, while it has improved its phone-building skills, hasn't improved its <em>phone-selling</em> skills. The Pixel 6 is only sold in 12 countries instead of the 100+ that Apple and Samsung sell in, and Google is already experiencing stock issues. Despite Google's brand recognition and several mega billion-dollar businesses, Google Hardware remains a tiny side project. So buy a Pixel 6 if you can—just don't do it from an eBay scalper.</p>\n<div><a name=\"page-2\"></a></div>\n<h2>Low prices and big camera bars</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pixel-6-7.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pixel-6-7-980x735.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pixel-6-7.jpg\">The back of the Pixel 6 Pro, with that distinctive camera bar.

The Pixel 6 Pro is $900, and with a 120 Hz 1440p display, 12 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, and a 5000 mAh battery, spec for spec it's relatively comparable with the Galaxy S21 Ultra. The S21 Ultra has an MSRP of $1200, though, so Google is coming in $300 cheaper.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806115#p3\">Read 54 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806115&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"231c6d388e822382bffff08127f562cdbe29e4268325ef3d8d75aefce2dccbe8","category":"Tech"}
