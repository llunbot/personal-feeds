It is the most affordable iPhone that Apple sells at the current time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16e is an amalgam of the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 16 in terms of design, featuring a 6.1-inch OLED display with a notch for the TrueDepth camera system, an aluminum frame with squared-off edges, a Ceramic Shield display, a single-lens rear camera, and an A18 chip with Apple Intelligence support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the iPhone 16e, Apple phased out several older technologies. There are no longer iPhones with Lightning ports, LCD displays, or 64GB storage options, and 6.1 inches is now the smallest display size that Apple offers. In the U.S., pricing starts at $599. The device is available in white or black, and with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage capacities.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-store-down-iphone-16e-pre-orders/\">Apple Store Down Ahead of iPhone 16e Pre-Orders</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-down-ahead-of-iphone-16e-pre-orders.2449867/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"994dcafce4a8e6326e7ecac354af50f3ae4a2901cfc48c9205202bc386b5a520","category":"Apple"}
