The GX Eagle AXS Transmission Upgrade Kit includes an AXS-enabled derailleur body, AXS Battery and AXS Pod Controller. Simply remove the threaded cage assembly and mount bolt from your mechanical Eagle 90 or 70 derailleur, and reinstall on the new GX Eagle AXS Transmission derailleur body. An included Eagle T-Type PowerLock gives you peace of mind when reinstalling the chain.</p>\n<p>The kit goes for $550 USD. For comparison, buying a battery, charger, shift pod, master link, and <em>complete</em> GX AXS derailleur would cost you $663. Saving $113 is pretty good, but we’d be remiss not to point out that the a-la-carte approach would presumably leave you with an intact Eagle 90 or 70 derailleur and a matching shifter to run it, which go for $155 to $240 when new. That’s probably the better choice if your cable-actuated Transmission drivetrain could go on to live a full life on another bike. But once it truly starts to show its age, the Transmission upgrade kit is a pretty smart option.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Includes AXS-enabled GX Eagle Transmission derailleur body, AXS Pod Controller, AXS Battery, Battery Charger, and Eagle T-Type PowerLock</li>\n<li>Threaded cage assembly and derailleur mount bolt not included.
