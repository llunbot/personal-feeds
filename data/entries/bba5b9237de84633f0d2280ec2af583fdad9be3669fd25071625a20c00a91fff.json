{"title":"Garmin Forerunner 965: The Complete Beginners Guide","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-forerunner-965-the-complete-beginners-guide.html","date":1678460235000,"content":"<p></p>\n<p>Just a quick heads up for those that aren’t subscribed on YouTube, that I’ve just hit publish on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ\">incredibly detailed hour-long user guide</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-forerunner-965-in-depth-review.html/\">new Garmin Forerunner 965</a>. As always, this comprehensive guide thoroughly explores every feature of the Forerunner 965, from beginning to end. Not only do I walk you through the latest additions on the FR965, but I will also cover all of the fundamental watch features. So whether you’re a first-time Garmin watch user, or upgrading from an older model that lacks the newest features released in the past year – this guide provides all the information you need to know (and a boatload more you probably never knew you needed to know).</p>\n<p>Of course, I dive deep into the new Forerunner 965-specific features too, like Training Load Ratio and Wrist-based Running Dynamics. As well as more recent areas like the newish Training Readiness, HRV Status, Race Calendar driven dynamic training plans based on scheduled races, revamped Daily Suggested Workouts, and more. And I dive into the new fancy AMOLED display a bit showing side-by-side MIPS vs AMOLED, including in sunny conditions.</p>\n<p>There’s plenty of goodness and tips/tidbits in this video that I don’t cover as deeply in the written review – especially around navigation, music, and contactless payments. And best of all, you can skip right to the video section you’re looking for using the YouTube chapters in the video itself, or the quick-links below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=0s\">0:00</a> The Game Plan<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=43s\">0:43</a> Hardware Overview<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=157s\">2:37</a> AMOLED Screen in Real-Life<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=425s\">7:05</a> Watch Face, Daily Activity Tracing, Widgets<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=582s\">9:42</a> Sleep Tracking &amp; Morning Report<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=882s\">14:42</a> HRV Status Deep-Dive<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=1037s\">17:17</a> Training Readiness Deep-Dive (and Load/recovery)<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=1232s\">20:32</a> Training Load Ratio/Chronic Load<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=1644s\">27:24</a> Race Calendar, Training Plans, Daily Suggested Workouts<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=1879s\">31:19</a> Sport Modes, Configuration, and Usage<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=2281s\">38:01</a> Native Running Power/Running Dynamics<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=2487s\">41:27</a> Stamina Explained<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=2701s\">45:01</a> Multiband GPS &amp; SatIQ<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=2927s\">48:47</a> Sensors &amp; Pairing<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=2993s\">49:53</a> Mapping, Navigation, Routing<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=3337s\">55:37</a> Flashlight Feature<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=3432s\">57:12</a> Music Support (Spotify)<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Cu39GLLrQ&amp;t=3616s\">1:00:16</a> Garmin Pay/Contactless Payments</p>\n<p>I’ve got a similar guide coming up shortly for the Forerunner 265 as well, though as you might imagine, many of the features are the same (minus things like Mapping, Training Load Ratio, Stamina, and…well…ok, that’s about it).</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for watching!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"bba5b9237de84633f0d2280ec2af583fdad9be3669fd25071625a20c00a91fff","category":"Cycling"}
