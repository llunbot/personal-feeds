Most of them are reimagined for e-bikes, with necessarily higher weight limits, rear lights, and even an automated lift system to make transporting a heavier bike simpler.</p>\n<p>The one with the most buzz – and people around it – had to be a yet-unreleased <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/1up/\" target=\"_blank\">1Up</a> rack that can carry up to a massive 150 lbs (68 kg) per tray. Most other racks seemed to pass under the radar. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/saris/\" target=\"_blank\">Saris</a> Door County isn’t particularly new, but it is unique in how specific it is to electric bikes, with a built-in electric lift to make getting on the bike and wheels under each tray to make moving the rack easier as well. And the <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/kuat/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuat</a> Piston Pro keeps the easy on-off feel of the flashy Piston Pro X rack, just without the Kashima and brake lights.</p>\n<p>A new bike rack isn’t particularly flashy, and once you have one, you don’t have to think about it unless it’s absolutely necessary. But considering the diversity of bikes folks are carrying around these days, it is worth checking out which designs are our favorites.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1up-XD-rack-hitch-with-bike-moto.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"1up-XD-rack-hitch-with-bike-moto\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1up-XD-rack-hitch-with-bike-moto.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1up-XD-rack-hitch-with-bike-moto.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>There was a major buzz around the new 1Up XD hitch rack. The XD rack can carry bikes and even motorcycles up to 150 lbs per tray. That means the Sur-ron electric motorcycle in the back easily fits out back, not to mention electric bikes and more.

This metal-on-metal process results in a positive, mechanical feel, but the XD rack’s larger indexing piece – what they traditionally call their ‘Glide Arm’ looks to be twice as big here, and even more satisfying to use.

Firstly, it installs onto a hitch without the need for tools. The two-bike rack can be converted to carry four bikes, and in doing so the handle for the tilt feature moves to the end of the rack, too.

The arm is beefy in feel; it had better be considering this rack is designed to carry up to a 70 lb bike per tray.

Further, the lights also pivot 90 degrees, meaning your lights will always point in the correct direction regardless of whether the rack is folded or in use. The brake light accessory requires just a four-pin electrical connection, but I do wish this wiring was a bit better integrated.

Think of it as the Piston Pro X without the excess. The collapsing cradle arms are hydraulically assisted to make opening snugging down your bike low-effort. What does it lose compared to the Piston Pro X? The nifty integrated brake lights and gold Kashima coating on the rack’s struts. You hate to see it, folks.

Squeeze to tighten the little lever, and each arm easily tightens against the bike’s tire to keep it in place with no contact with the frame. Squeeze it again, and the rack opens back up with minimal effort.

Squeeze a pair of tabs inside, and you can easily adjust between the different wheel sizes. It’s all so easy, which it better be at MSRP at $1098.

They took the Piston Pro X and essentially made a roof tray that packs all the same technology. At the show, they had it mounted to the new IBEX truck bed rack that is targeting the overland crowd.
