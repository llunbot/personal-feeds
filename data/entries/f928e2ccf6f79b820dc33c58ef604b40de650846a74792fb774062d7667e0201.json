Let’s take a closer look at this wild cosmic splatter pista!</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/CannondaleTrack-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Aluminum Track Frames</h3>\n<p>Back in February of 2024, I documented <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/1994-cannondale-track-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Sean’s 1994 Cannondale track bike</a> in all its polished aluminum glory. At the time, Sean had picked up racing at the local velodrome. Inspired by the classic lines and smooth welds that these track bikes were known for, he pinged the Beach Club factory in Italy to make a run of frames, inspired by these timeless classics.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-41.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-41.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-41.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-41.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Unlike the 1″ steel fork steerer Cannondales, the Beach Club track bikes feature a 1 1/8″ steerer with a carbon fork. The geometry is slightly more relaxed on the Beach Club, the top tube slopes backward, instead of slightly forward like on the Cannondale, and the track ends are less obtuse. As you can see by the Mavic Cosmic wheels, the spacing is still track-specific, offering the ideal 42 mm chainline. Beach Club’s factory in Italy used beautiful Dedacciai tubing on the pista model.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-18.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Yes, Ashley Anodized It</h3>\n<p>Once Beach Club received its first batch of track bikes from Italy, they pinged anodizing genius Ashley Anodized It to coat the bike in a cosmic splatter goodness. And get wild she did! The frame has various splatter treatments – Ashley used it as a canvas to experiment with various finishing techniques. The result is nothing short of amazing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-7.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-7.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-8.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-8.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-37.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-37.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-37.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-37.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Over a year ago, I saw the bare frame in the Beach Club offices in Malibu, California. The brand displayed the frame in front of a massive picture frame window, hung by monofilament line, seemingly floating over the crashing shorebreak waves of Zuma Beach.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-9a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-9a.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-9a.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-9a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-34a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-34a.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-34a.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-34a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As I walked into the Japanese Brutalist architect Tadao Ando-designed mansion, Sean and Danny from Beach Club took a hit at their in-house oxygen bar and exclaimed, “No photos, you have to wait until it’s built up…”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Beach-Club-Track-x-Ashley-Anodized-It-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Beach Club lost its Zuma beachfront property when the kitty litter market crashed in late 2024. A year later, the brand’s new office is located adjacent to The Cub House in San Marino. Sean built the bike up to race at the track, and yes,  The Cub House currently has some raw polished frames for sale. Holler at them to order one. While they would technically offer this finish from Ashley, it would be very pricey, so <em>caveat emptor</em>.</p>\n<p>Even if you’d never own a bike like this, it’s wild to look at, so enjoy some detailed photos in the gallery.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/beach-club-track-x-ashley-anodized-it/\">Beach Club Track x Ashley Anodized It: Cosmic Splatter Pista</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f928e2ccf6f79b820dc33c58ef604b40de650846a74792fb774062d7667e0201","category":"Cycling"}
