His chaos aesthetic and love of the laden wheel make him the perfect person to create (the first ever?) bikepacking board game.</em></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Cards-in-Array-3-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Cards-in-Array-3-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Cards-in-Array-3-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Cards-in-Array-3-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Jody says: <em>“…with the help of my own long-suffering group of crazy bikepacker friends and many hours of extremely fun games testing and designing I am ready to launch this little pedal swan into the choppy waters. This is a crazy and funny game that captures the fun, filth and freaky times of bikepacking. Join YOUR long suffering friends and co-operate on a journey while also sneaking heavy rocks into each others bags and foraging for suspicious fruits in the fading light…”</em></p>\n<p><em>“…the game is great, I got dirty &amp; filthy and I didn’t even have to leave the house…” </em>Allan Shaw – World Famous Bikepacker</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Dev-Hell-3-2-.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Dev-Hell-3-2-.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Dev-Hell-3-2-.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Dev-Hell-3-2-.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As you travel through the world, Jody has created that you’ll encounter crazed woodland creatures corrupted by their own criminality, hallucinatory visions of unicycling serpents, dancing flowers, drinkable chain lube, and medical experiments with bib short bacteria, plus 101 other eventualities – in other words, it’s exactly like a real bikepacking adventure. If it makes you feel better for not being on a real trip, put the tent up in the house and play inside that for maximum oxygen depletion. Just watch out for the Local Vegan Militia, who own the dumpstering rights on your trail.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Box-Art-Kickstarter-3-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Box-Art-Kickstarter-3-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Box-Art-Kickstarter-3-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Box-Art-Kickstarter-3-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Dirty Filthy Bikepacking launches on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jodybarton/dirty-filthy-bikepacking-board-game\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a> on the 2nd June – it is printed in the E.U. by Fabryka Kart who specialize in the sustainable production of board games – and is deliverable tariff-free worldwide by DHL.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/dirty-filthy-bikepacking-boardgame-kickstarter/\">Dirty Filthy Bikepacking Boardgame Kickstarter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9280f7d479ccacce4be15e99cba46664f0cba4ce3e4d7d043b7a8ec4b64ebafd","category":"Cycling"}
