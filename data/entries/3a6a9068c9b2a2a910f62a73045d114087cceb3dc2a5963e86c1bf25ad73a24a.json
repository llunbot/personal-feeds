However, there’s a world away from Continental Europe waiting to be explored by two wheels. To add a little adventure and cultural discovery into your cycling holiday, Southeast Asia could be the ideal choice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help with this, 12Go compiles transport options, reviews and prices across Asia to give you an extensive travel overview on all major routes in the region. With affordable prices, it’s the ideal tool for budget travellers looking to tackle Southeast Asia, whether that be by bus, train, plane or taxi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform caters for all kinds of travellers, regardless of your holiday goals. Whether it’s an hour-long transfer, a sleeper train or overnight bus journey, travelling light or not, there’s a travel solution for everyone on 12Go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tough to know where to start when planning a cycling holiday in Southeast Asia. 12Go gives you the low-down on train, bus and plane baggage policies and allowances, however, you still need some routes and destinations to tick off the list. Here are some cyclo-tourism pointers in Southeast Asia to whet your appetite. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coastal Thailand</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"962\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-970x962.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-970x962.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-300x297.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-150x150.webp 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-768x761.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-75x75.webp 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-750x744.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1-1140x1130.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-1.webp 1170w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thailand is the most visited nation in Southeast Asia. With its blend of cultures, stunning scenery and vibrant cuisine, Thailand is the perfect place to experience the core essence of the subcontinent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To experience a real mix of landscapes – beaches, limestone karst formations and lush hills – southern Thailand may be of note. The tourist hotspot of Krabi is a fitting place to start, with its lush beaches and busy night markets. Head inland on a ride and you’ll soon find yourself within limestone creeks and rolling valleys. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to part ways with the mainland, you can take a boat across to the tropical islands to the east. Try cycling in the rolling hills of western Phuket, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://12go.asia/en/thailand/phuket?utm_source=cyclist.co.uk&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SoutheastAsiabybike+&amp;utm_term=march2025\" target=\"_blank\">Travel guide to Phuket</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://12go.asia/en/thailand/krabi?utm_source=cyclist.co.uk&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SoutheastAsiabybike+&amp;utm_term=march2025\" target=\"_blank\">Travel guide to Krabi</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Chiang Mai: Thailand’s climbing paradise </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1152\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-300x300.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-970x970.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-150x150.webp 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-768x768.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-75x75.webp 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-350x350.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-750x750.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/398617794_810612664408386_4432675644641350700_n-1140x1140.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A sleeper train ride away from Bangkok in the northern Thailand, Chiang Mai is nestled right within the mountains. The city – locally known as the ‘Rose of the North’ – is on the doorstep of Thailand’s toughest climbs and offers a vibrant cultural scene much less well-trodden than that of the capital Bangkok.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a 40km ride from the city centre, you can climb up to the hidden gem temple of Wat Pha Lat or look out over Chiang Mai from the gold-clad temple of Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Chiang Mai’s scenic 100km Samoeng Loop is a bucket list ride for any cyclist. The route starts in the city centre before winding up hairpins deep into the Samoeng Forest, past elephant sanctuaries and gold-wrapped Buddhist temples over the course of the day-long ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a more extreme challenge, Thailand’s highest peak Doi Inthanon is not far from the city centre. The 39km-long test averages 5.8% in gradient, cresting at an impressive 2,565m above sea level – similar to that of the Stelvio Pass in Italy. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://12go.asia/en/travel/bangkok/chiang-mai?utm_source=cyclist.co.uk&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SoutheastAsiabybike+&amp;utm_term=march2025\" target=\"_blank\">How to get from Bangkok to Chiang Mai</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vietnam’s Ha Giang Loop: A bikepacking adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Image-750x563.webp 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For confident cyclists, the Ha Giang Loop is one of the toughest cycling routes on offer in Southeast Asia. To reach the starting point of the loop in the city of Ha Giang – described by some as the most beautiful city in Vietnam – you can take a six-hour bus ride from Hanoi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An adventurous circuit tailored towards bikepacking, the loop covers a mountainous 300km route in northern Vietnam, not far from the Chinese border. It’s popular among experienced cyclists and motorbikers who enjoy the breathtaking climbs, rugged gravel paths and stunning creeks. Keep an eye out for the remote switchbacks of the Chín Khoanh climb especially. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking in over 7,000m in altitude gain, the loop offers a real physical challenge amongst a fascinating cultural backdrop of the Ha Giang Province. Due to weather conditions, it’s best to tackle the loop between November and March as to avoid extreme heat and rainfall. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://12go.asia/en/travel/hanoi/ha-giang?utm_source=cyclist.co.uk&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SoutheastAsiabybike+&amp;utm_term=march2025\" target=\"_blank\">How to get from Hanoi to Ha Giang</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Laos: River islands and rainforest climbs </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1.webp\" alt=\"Beautiful landscape of mountains in Vang vieng, Laos.\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/323636877_473656891409259_1475776747350105372_n-1-1140x641.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Laos is the least visited nation in Southeast Asia. Although, in the past decade it has become one of the most raved-about destinations on the whole continent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The landlocked nation is diverse in landscape due to its elongated shape. The roads in the north are more suited to gravel and road riding. One multi-day route (around 250km) sees you set off from Vang Vieng, a short train ride to the north of the capital Vientiane, to take on the scenic Route 13 through the Laos Highlands. Passing over the Phu Khoun Viewpoint, the route concludes in the charming ancient city of Luang Prabang. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Luang Prabang is a must-see in the region. The city, rich in Buddhist culture, is situated in a valley that offers some adventurous off-road rides through jungle-like terrain and remote villages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the south, the nation is flatter in terrain. If you follow the Mekong River southwards, you can visit two of Laos’ most popular destinations. Firstly, the World Heritage Site of Vat Phou – a complex of ruined Hindu temples from centuries ago. Then, if you carry on around 100km downstream, you can enjoy some island hopping through the river archipelago of the Si Phan Don Islands. Picturesque and flat, the south is ideal for cyclists of all abilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://12go.asia/en/laos?utm_source=cyclist.co.uk&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SoutheastAsiabybike+&amp;utm_term=march2025\" target=\"_blank\">12 Go’s guide to travelling in Laos</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bali: Indonesia’s jewel </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1394\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n-300x204.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n-970x660.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n-768x523.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n-1536x1046.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n-750x510.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/307293027_5280435042053871_2628526644246984012_n-1140x776.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The island of Bali has a growing cycling ecosystem.

This also coincides with the busiest tourist season, so keep an eye out for that affecting accommodation and flight prices.
