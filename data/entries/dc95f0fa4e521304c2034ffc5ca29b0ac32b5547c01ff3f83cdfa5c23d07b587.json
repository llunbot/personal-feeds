To open proceedings in 2025, the typical opening weekend of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-guide\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kuurne-brussels-kuurne-guide\">Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne</a> will provide the first opportunities for riders to chew into the Classics calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defending champion of the women’s race Marianne Vos will not be in attendance, neither will the runner-up Lotte Kopecky. Don’t worry though,  the top-ranked women’s rider from 2024 Demi Vollering will be here to target her first one-day victory in FDJ-Suez colours. In the men’s race, 2024 winner Jan Tratnik <em>will</em> be in Ghent to defend his title, albeit on a different team to last year. Wout van Aert will be looking to take the title back from his former teammate though as he aims to pick up a second Omloop title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/cycling/omloop-het-nieuwsblad/winner\" target=\"_blank\">According to the bookies’,</a> Wout van Aert is the favourite for glory this weekend. He has the shortest odds at around 4-1, ahead of Belgian Arnaud De Lie, the UAE Team Emirates duo of Jhonathan Narváez and António Morgado, and French youngster Paul Magnier. The bookmakers also give Tom Pidcock, Mathias Vacek and Matteo Jorgenson a good shot at victory, all with odds under 20-1.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Favourites for the men’s race</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"wout van aert portugal 2024 vuelta a espana\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wout van Aert will be the most marked man in the peloton this weekend. Without the presence of Mathieu van der Poel, Mads Pedersen and Tadej Pogačar on the startline, Van Aert has a great chance to start his Classics season with a win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Belgian has won this race before, riding away to glory in 2022, and last year, he added a third place at Omloop to his record. The hills and cobbles are obviously suited to Van Aert, and the potential for it to come down to a sprint gives him several ways to win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although he had a mixed Volta ao Algarve this month, Van Aert showed some signs of form on the final day’s mountain time-trial. To help, Visma-Lease a Bike are bringing a characteristically strong squad, including Dwaars door Vlaanderen winner Matteo Jorgenson, Tiesj Benoot and Visma prodigal son<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/victor-campenaerts-profile\"> Victor Campenaerts</a>. The Dutch outfit have won the three previous editions of the men’s race – with a different rider each time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, it’s tough to imagine a final podium without Wout van Aert.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Biniam Girmay (Intermarché-Wanty)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-1140x641.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>Intermarché-Wanty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a phenomenal 2024, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\">Biniam Girmay</a> will be returning to the Classics with high expectations. The Tour de France green jersey winner will be hoping to replicate his former glory in the one-day races and claim his first WorldTour Classic since 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intermarché-Wanty sprinter has been fairly consistent so far in 2025, cracking the top ten in a handful of sprints. He’s often thrived in this early part of the calendar, so expectations will be high this weekend. The mix of cobbles, hills and a potential sprint also benefits Girmay, who can be up there in any race scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Girmay will be flanked by Laurens Rex and Adrien Petit, two riders who have enjoyed solid Classics campaigns in recent years. That said, the Eritrean should be fine to fend for himself.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-omloop-het-nieuwsblad\">How to watch Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kuurne-brussels-kuurne-guide\">Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-guide\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025 preview: Routes, favourites, how to watch and start lists</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Arnaud De Lie (Lotto)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicknamed ‘The Bull’, Arnaud De Lie has rapidly risen through the ranks to become one of the most exciting riders in the pro peloton. Still just 22 years old, the Belgian has been in contention to win Omloop twice before and it’s hard to imagine him outside of the top ten this weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De Lie has already opened his victory count for 2025 with a stage victory at the Étoile de Bessèges. He’s been clocking up the kilometres over the past month and has stretched his legs in a couple of sprints in 2025 already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rugged sprinter capable of getting over hills, De Lie has what it takes to hold onto the wheels up the Kapelmuur and is one of the few riders that could defeat Wout van Aert if they come to the line together. A major Flemish Classic is missing from De Lie’s <em>palmarès</em>, but that could soon change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>UAE Tour/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time Omloop Het Nieuwsblad was decided by a sprint was in 2021 when QuickStep’s Davide Ballerini took the win ahead of a 45-man group. Although the three most recent editions have been won solo, there’s always a possibility that the victory will come down to a bunch sprint at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jasper Philipsen will be the fastest sprinter to start Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Twice runner-up at Paris-Roubaix, he evidently has a knack for the Classics and he’ll tackle a more one-day-focussed programme in 2025. The bumps on offer on the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad may be too tricky for Philipsen, however if he holds on he will be hard to defeat in a sprint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent results may suggest otherwise though, Philipsen missed the mark at the UAE Tour, being outgunned by the likes of Jonathan Milan and Tim Merlier. Given Philipsen’s presence in the race, rival teams may try to up the pace on the course’s hardest sectors in order to dislodge the Belgian.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tom Pidcock (Q36.5)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Vuelta Andalucia</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After his messy breakup with Ineos, Yorkshire’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-profile\">Tom Pidcock</a> has found a new lease of life with Swiss ProTeam Q36.5. After just two months, Pidcock has already claimed three stage victories, the same figure that he achieved at Ineos Grenadiers over the past two-years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pidcock has had a mixed relationship with Flemish Classics. His first Belgian campaign was his most convincing, taking the 2021 Brabantse Pijl title and a podium finish at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne. Over the past two seasons, his record has been patchy, however, he’s looking a lot more consistent now that he has left Ineos Grenadiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His killer punch looks to have returned and that could come in handy on the steep bergs of Flanders, particularly the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/muur-van-geraardsbergen-cycling\">Muur van Geraardsbergen</a>. A recent win at the Vuelta Andalucia also demonstrates that he’s got his sprinting legs back in shape. If Pidcock were to win the race on Saturday, this will surely guarantee Q36.5 future invites to the Flemish calendar, perhaps enticing Grand Tours to invite the squad as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jhonathan Narváez (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>UAE Team Emirates XRG/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jhonathan Narváez has had a barnstorming start to life at UAE Team Emirates XRG. He won his first stage race of the year at the Tour Down Under. He then flew across the globe and defended his Ecuadorian national title the following week. He hasn’t raced since then but Narváez has clearly demonstrated a step-up in form since leaving Ineos Grenadiers, probably helped by the strength of his new team. He certainly looks capable of bagging a big one-day victory this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narváez has always been a solid racer in Flanders. He has shone up the short <em>hellingen </em>and has a decent kick that could set him apart from some of the contenders on this list. On a tougher profile at E3 last year, the Ecuadorian finished in a respectable sixth place. He’s never targeted a race like Omloop before, but he has a great chance to leave his mark this year to become the first non-European winner in the race’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now part of the UAE superteam, Narváez should benefit from stronger team support at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. A partnership with Nils Politt and António Morgado could prove lethal, with all three bringing different strengths to the table. In a similar ilk to Visma-Lease a Bike last year, they could throw the kitchen sink at this race and come out victorious.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oier Lazkano (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-970x646.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-1140x759.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Red Bull-Bora-Hangrohe/Getty Sport</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe are desperately bidding for superteam status. As part of this ambition, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-transfers-2025-winners-and-losers\">the German squad recruited a fleet of upcoming Classics stars,</a> including the Van Dijke twins, Laurence Pithie and this man, Oier Lazkano. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While riding for Movistar last year, the Spaniard stepped up to the plate in the Flemish Classics. Although his former team have historically struggled on these courses, Lazkano came out of the spring with a string of top ten results including a podium place at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne. His form rippled into the Grand Tours and he has shown that he is one of the most promising <em>rouleurs </em>in the bunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young Spaniard is an aggressive rider, unphased by an attack or two. He can weather the climbs well, so the selection of cobbled <em>bergs </em>and <em>hellingen</em> should be of no major difficulty. He doesn’t have the most ferocious sprint, but he could try a flyer in the final kilometres to seal Spain’s first Omloop Het Nieuwsblad victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>António Morgado (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>UAE Team Emirates XRG/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>António Morgado was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classics-breakout-2024\">a revelation of the 2024 Classics campaign</a>, becoming the youngest rider to reach the top five of the Tour of Flanders since the war period. Having moved up the pecking order within UAE Team Emirates XRG, Morgado now has the faith of his team to chase more Classics success in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A profile like this could suit Morgado well. He’s a strong enough climber to stick with the favourites and he is not afraid to throw an attack off the front of the group. His sprint isn’t too bad either, as demonstrated in his second place at Belgian Classic Le Samyn last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young Portuguese rider has already taken a one-day victory in 2025 at the Figueira Champions Classic. He was particularly strong there, sealing the victory in an impressive long-range move.

Omloop Het Nieuwsblad could offer a chance to make that a reality, however the sub-200km route might hinder Mohorič’s chances given he shines on longer days.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-omloop-het-nieuwsblad\">How to watch Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kuurne-brussels-kuurne-guide\">Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-guide\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025 preview: Routes, favourites, how to watch and start lists</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Favourites for the women’s race</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199398160-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"GANDIA SPAIN - FEBRUARY 13: Demi Vollering of Netherlands and Team FDJ - SUEZ celebrates at finish line as stage winner during the 9th Setmana Ciclista - Volta Femenina de la Comunitat Valenciana 2025, Stage 1 a 112km stage from Alzira to Gandia on February 13, 2025 in Gandia, Spain.

The Dutchwoman won the opening stage of the Volta de la Comunitat Valenciana, paving the way to the overall title there. On flying form, she defeated her former boss and teammate Anna van der Breggen and Marlen Reusser, both of whom will be rivals later on in the Classics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Vollering has a decent record. She finished runner-up in 2022, only missing out in a two-up sprint to Annemiek van Vleuten. In the following years’ editions, Vollering worked for her teammate Lotte Kopecky while still finishing within the top 20. Now unshackled by the SD Worx-Protime chains, Vollering will be the out-and-out leader of FDJ-Suez on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Tour champion should enjoy the climbs on offer at the Flemish race, with some cobbles to add an extra obstacle. She’s performed well at the Tour of Flanders and Brabantse Pijl in the past, so she can clearly do well at Omloop. She may launch a long-range move, but she also has a decent kick to her if she has to tow one of her rivals to the line – unless that’s her former teammate Lorena Wiebes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-ProTime)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>UAE Tour Women</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Wiebes, the European champion has started 2025 in winning ways. At the UAE Tour earlier in February, Wiebes claimed three stage wins, sweeping up every sprint on offer. She’s already warmed up and is ready to tackle a busy one-day schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong Classics rider in her own right, Wiebes will be able to chase her own fortunes without Lotte Kopecky on the startline in Ghent. As a competent gravel rider, she’s proven her prowess on rough surfaces. The hills, however, may be a hurdle for Wiebes to reach the line in front, but she’s capable of hanging on and waiting for a final sprint in this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one will want to bring Wiebes to the line, however. Expect Movistar and FDJ-Suez to set a high pace around halfway through the race once the hills come thick and fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Marlen Reusser (Movistar)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1.jpg 1380w\" /><figcaption>Movistar Team</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another SD Worx exitee, Marlen Reusser has refound her winning legs at Movistar. After a tough year at SD Worx last year due to illness, the Swiss rider has bounced back and already taken her first win of the 2025 season in Mallorca. On top of that, Reusser highlighted her climbing strength with a GC podium in Valenciana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser, a former winner of Gent-Wevelgem, has been used as a teammate before at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. As team leader this year, she will have a chance to show what SD Worx were missing out on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A long-range move could be on the cards. I wouldn’t be surprised of she’s the only one to follow Vollering if they decide to go long. However, Reusser might be cagey in order to avoid a final sprint to the line. The Swiss rouleur will hope for few companions if it comes down to a reduced group in Ninove.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During her first proper road season in 2024, Puck Pieterse surprised many in the Classics. She lit up the Tour of Flanders and Strade Bianche, finishing inside the top ten of both. With a stage win on Tour debut in August, the multi-discpline sensation will start as Fenix-Deceuninck’s leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pieterse has a solid sprint on her. She proved this at the Tour last year when she outgunned Vollering and Niewiadoma on Stage 4’s hilly stage to Liège. If conditions are rough, Pieterse could thrive given her strong bike handling honed in her other pursuits in mountain biking and cyclocross.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-05T165415.935.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kasia Niewiadoma can never be counted out of a Classic like this. She finished comfortably inside the top ten of this race last year and she’s got the race craft to hang on with the major contenders on a rolling profile like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reigning Tour de France Femmes title holder has been close to a major cobbled trophy in recent years. She was on the podium of the Tour of Flanders last year and Brabantse Pijl in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the punches roll on the uphills, Niewiadoma could make her move for glory. Her confidence has grown since her breakthrough win at La Flèche Wallonne, so she might be feeling brave on Saturday. With the support of Chiara Consonni, the team could try and outmuscle the others through brute force. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-Protime)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199631738-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Szymon Gruchalski/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A little hardier than her teammate Wiebes, Mischa Bredewold could be another key player for SD Worx-Protime. Often third or fourth in line at the Dutch superteam, the former European champion has the chance to crack the podium of Omloop for the first time in her young career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dutchwoman claimed her first win of the season at the Volta de la Comunitat Valenciana, finishing ahead of the pack in a hectic bunch sprint. Riding on this wave of form, the reigning GP Plouay champion could be among the favourites for victory this weekend if the race opens up beyond the likes of Vollering, Reusser and Niewiadoma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bredewold is one of the faster sprinters on this list. If she’s in a reduced group, she could easily find her way onto the podium, following in the footsteps of her teammate Lotte Kopecky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other contenders</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/elisa-balsamo-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Lidl-Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisa Balsamo is a late addition onto the startlist of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. The Italian sprinter has claimed victories on rolling profiles and cobbled races like this. She has also slipped into the top ten of this race on two previous occasions, peaking in fourth place during her rainbow season in 2022. The Lidl-Trek leader will be supported by an accomplished roster, including new recruit Emma Norsgaard and Ellen van Dijk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of support riders, Movistar’s Liane Lippert could spring away on the hills. She’ll be on lieutenant duties for Reusser, but the German has the strengths to reach the top ten in a race like Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Another domestique, FDJ-Suez’s Amber Kraak rode a wave of Classics form last year to score a handful of top tens in the cobbled Classics. If Vollering’s off the mark, Kraak could reach the top ten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking further down the startlist, keep an eye out for Picnic-PostNL’s British leader Pfeiffer Georgi, UAE Team ADQ’s Silvia Persico and UCI points hoover Thalita De Jong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-favourites-2\">Who are the favourites for Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"dc95f0fa4e521304c2034ffc5ca29b0ac32b5547c01ff3f83cdfa5c23d07b587","category":"Cycling"}
