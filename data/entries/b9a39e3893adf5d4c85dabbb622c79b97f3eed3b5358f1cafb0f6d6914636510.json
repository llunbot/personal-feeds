As of now HomePod and HomePod mini speakers don’t support lossless audio and only support Dolby Atmos spatial audio when connected as the default speaker on an Apple TV 4K. Apple says “the difference between AAC and lossless audio is virtually indistinguishable,” so listeners might not be able to hear the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you should be able to test it out yourself in just a couple short months.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b9a39e3893adf5d4c85dabbb622c79b97f3eed3b5358f1cafb0f6d6914636510","category":"Apple"}
