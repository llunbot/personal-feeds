Weibo leaker @PandaIsBald, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/low-cost-ipad-debut-apple-event/\">accurately reported</a> the launch of the baseline ninth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> for Apple's last event, <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6734482564/KCqCenjWW\">has claimed</a> that alongside \"M1X\" Macs, the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ with an updated design will also be announced.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third-generation ‌AirPods‌ will be the first significant design change to the ‌AirPods‌ line since the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> in 2019. The new ‌AirPods‌ will replace the existing second-generation ‌AirPods‌ in the line and feature an updated redesign that takes inspiration from the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌, but without \"Pro\" features like Active Noise Cancelation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe refreshed ‌AirPods‌ are expected to take design cues from the ‌AirPods Pro‌ and leaked schematics and images but appear to confirm those design changes. However, what remains unclear is whether the new ‌AirPods‌ will feature silicone ear-tips,  like the ‌AirPods Pro‌, or feature the same in-ear design as the first and second-generation ‌AirPods‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPrevious reports suggested that Apple's second planned event for the fall would focus on new Macs and iPads. Surprisingly, Apple announced an updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> and baseline ‌iPad‌ during its September event, leaving the upcoming \"Unleashed\" event to be wholly focused on the Mac. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new highly anticipated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros will feature better performance, a new design, and a mini-LED display that could feature ProMotion, allowing for a 120Hz variable refresh rate. Apple is also likely to announce a date for when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> will launch to the public.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2021-apple-event/\">October 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/new-airpods-during-unleashed-apple-event/\">Redesigned AirPods Expected to be Announced During Monday's 'Unleashed' Apple Event</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/redesigned-airpods-expected-to-be-announced-during-mondays-unleashed-apple-event.2316711/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Cxk-xpNAnFU:xZKe2rfRdKM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Cxk-xpNAnFU:xZKe2rfRdKM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Cxk-xpNAnFU\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2ca71d70966449f2c441ba5442cbd605b5d4ceecf68bf935cd863a0c25029f8f","category":"Apple"}
