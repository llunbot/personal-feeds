One is a 13-inch Surface Laptop, which we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/lighter-cheaper-surface-laptop-saves-a-little-money-but-gives-up-a-lot\">covered in more detail here</a>. The second (and more notably changed) device is a new 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, which is the first significant design change we've seen in the Surface Pro lineup since the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/hands-on-with-microsofts-barrage-of-new-surface-devices/\">first ARM-based Surface Pro X</a> was released in 2019.</p>\n<p>Preorders for both new Surface devices begin today, and they begin shipping on May 20. The 12-inch Surface Pro starts at $799, and the keyboard cover remains a separate purchase, available for $149.</p>\n<p>The 12-inch Surface Pro is a cheaper alternative to the $939-and-up 13-inch Surface Pro (which Microsoft is continuing to sell), and the smallest Surface Microsoft has tried since the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/surface-go-3-is-a-processor-bump-for-microsofts-smallest-tablet/\">10.5-inch underspecced Surface Go series</a>. In addition to the smaller screen, the base model includes a bunch of other minor downgrades from the flagship 13-inch tablet, as outlined in the table below. But it's also nearly half a pound lighter, and its 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor should still deliver solid performance and compatibility with the extra Windows 11 features available on Copilot+ PCs.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d677569327d0365f32971035f2d109609d24c7f6bb26913a38a8fc112deb226d","category":"Tech"}
