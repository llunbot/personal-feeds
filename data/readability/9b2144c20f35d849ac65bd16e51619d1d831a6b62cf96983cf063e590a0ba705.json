The elastic swing of his bike from side to side. The gritted teeth. That sense of kinetic energy, coiled up like rubber bands in a golf ball, waiting to spring free.</p><p>On Sunday at the World Championships, Alaphilippe won in much <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/09/gallery-superstar-solos-at-the-last-minute-road-worlds/\">the same way that he did in Imola</a> a year earlier. Like a storm marching in from the horizon, the pressure piled on at the front of a reduced peloton. And then there was Alaphilippe on the front with a slope as a springboard from which he could leap.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_phase\">imperial phase</a> of Julian Alaphilippe has lasted so long that it’s hard to recall a time before it. Since the 2019 Tour de France – when he held a rapt homeland in his palm for almost a full three weeks – Alaphilippe’s best has been <em>the</em> measure by which other riders are measured.</p><p>In the years since then, the Frenchman’s biggest wins have been the ones with an emotional core nestled within. In that humanity lies his secret weapon, as a rider and as a marketable commodity. He rides as he is – <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/08/julian-alaphilippes-ride-from-grief-to-glory/\">mourning</a>, in love, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/julian-alaphilippes-ride-of-love-loss-and-longing/\">smitten with his son</a>, overexuberant.</p><p>At the Flanders Worlds, we got vintage Alaphilippe: a sequence of stinging accelerations, a tenacious stretching of the gap, and then total commitment to the line.</p><p>When he reached the finish line – arms flailing about with exhausted abandon in his victory salute – he became the 13th dual World Champion, and just the seventh to defend it. But he was also just Julian Alaphilippe, riding his bike as Julian Alaphilippe does.</p><p>“I want to continue to attack, to enjoy, to race with panache – even if I lose sometimes or a lot of times,” he said in his post-race conference. “I want to give everything to try and win, with my heart, and that’s even more beautiful when you have the rainbow jersey on your shoulders.”</p><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kramon_UCIWorlds2021_EliteMenRR_09716-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>The race featured intermittently alternating laps of a circuit around Leuven – where a vast sea of some 300,000 spectators showed up.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kramon_UCIWorlds2021_EliteMenRR_10059-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>These vibrant scenes were a striking contrast to last year’s World Championships, which was more or less spectator-free.<p>(Nature is healing, etcetera.)</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kramon_UCIWorldsMenElite2021_R-6455-1340x894.jpg\"><figcaption>The peloton makes its way up the Keizersberg.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kramon_UCIWorldsMenElite2021_R-6496-1340x894.jpg\"><figcaption>There’s just something about cycling in the European heartland, isn’t there?</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kramon_UCIWorldsMenElite2021_R-8599-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Fan-drians.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kramon_UCIWorlds2021_EliteMenRR_10032-1340x871.jpg\"><figcaption>Kasper Asgreen has had more successful days in Flanders this year, but he played an important role for the Danish team early on.
