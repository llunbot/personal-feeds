If possible, make sure the iPhone is not Activation Locked, as this would prevent you from using the device unless you know the previous owner's Apple ID and password.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor in-person purchases, Apple shared a helpful checklist for inspecting a preowned iPhone. Apple explains how to check for damage, how to find out if parts have been replaced, how to view the battery's health, how to find out if the iPhone is locked to a carrier, how to ensure hardware like the camera and microphone are functional, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile some of the tips are obvious, Apple's support document might be worth bookmarking if you plan to buy a used iPhone in the future.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-preowned-iphone-checklist/\">Apple Shares Checklist With Important Tips for Buying a Used iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-checklist-with-important-tips-for-buying-a-used-iphone.2407322/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e2992763010cc0160d99ca103bdeba1007aff46c576c88450153842bcf7c5eb0","category":"Apple"}
