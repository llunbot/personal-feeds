The keyboard was only available with the redesigned 24-inch iMac, but as of this week, the keyboard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-purchase/\">can be purchased separately for use with any Mac with an M1 chip</a>, including the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/Magic-Keyboard-Touch-ID-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also started shipping the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad with braided USB-C to Lightning cables in the box, and the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID is available in an extended Numeric Keypad layout.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Reveals New Child Safety Features, Including Scanning Photos for Known Sexual Abuse Material</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/apple-new-child-safety-features/\">previewed new child safety features that will be coming to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac</a> with software updates later this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/iphone-communication-safety-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe upcoming features include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/apple-communication-safety-children-only/\">Communication Safety tool in the Messages app</a> that warns children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos, the ability for Apple to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/security-researchers-alarmed-apple-csam-plans/\">detect known Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) images</a> stored in iCloud Photos, and improved CSAM guidance from Siri/Spotlight Search.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Adds New High-End Graphics Options for Mac Pro</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThis week saw Apple release <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/mac-pro-w6800x-w6900x-graphics/\">new high-end AMD Radeon Pro W6000 series graphics modules for the 2019 Mac Pro</a>. The new graphics options are available when configuring a new Mac Pro on Apple's online store, and the modules are also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/mac-pro-w6000-graphics-modules/\">being sold on a standalone basis</a> for installation in an existing Mac Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/radeon-pro-w6000-series-mpx-modules.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple has shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/mac-pro-w6000-graphics-support-documents/\">support documents</a> walking through the many different display setups that can be used with the GPUs and how to use AMD's Infinity Fabric Link technology for increased performance and faster data transfer between the modules.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Unreleased Apple Watches and Macs Listed in Regulatory Database</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe fall season is just around the corner and, as usual, that means we can expect several new Apple products to launch in the coming months.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-Watch-7-Unreleased-Feature-Red.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn advance, Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/02/apple-eec-database-macs-apple-watches/\">filed a lengthy list of unreleased Mac and Apple Watch models</a> in the Eurasian Economic Commission's regulatory database. These listings will likely end up being the Apple Watch Series 7 models and new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">Apple silicon 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Wi-Fi 6E Explained: What It Could Mean for iPhone 13 and Beyond</h2>\r\n<br />\r\niPhone 13 models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/iphone-13-wi-fi-6e-rumor/\">widely rumored to feature Wi-Fi 6E</a>, and to better understand what this means, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/02/wifi-6e-explained-iphone-13-and-beyond/\">sat down for an exclusive interview with Kevin Robinson</a>, senior vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/iPhone-13-Wi-Fi-6E-feature-update.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a surface level, Wi-Fi 6E offers the features and capabilities of Wi-Fi 6, including higher performance, lower latency, and faster data rates, extended into the 6 GHz band. However, there are a lot more nuances, so <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/02/wifi-6e-explained-iphone-13-and-beyond/\">the interview is a worthwhile read</a> ahead of the release of iPhone 13 models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Working AirPower Prototype Shown in Video Clip</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/working-airpower-prototype-shown-in-video-clip/\">video of a seemingly functional AirPower prototype</a> has been shared on Twitter by Apple device collector Giulio Zompetti, in what appears to be a first-of-its-kind look at the elusive charger in action.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/airpower-prototype-video.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe video shows a unique on-screen iOS animation when the iPhone is placed on the ‌AirPower‌ charging mat, which has only previously been seen in Apple's early marketing materials, making it the first time this animation has been seen in the wild. An ‌iPhone‌ on the ‌AirPower‌ charger would have shown the charge of all of the devices that were placed on the pad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple's Website Reintroduces Dedicated 'Store' Tab</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWhat's old is new again! Apple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-website-redesigned-store/\">reintroduced a dedicated online \"Store\" section on its website</a>, allowing customers to browse products in a centralized place. Apple had removed the section in 2015, but a pandemic-driven surge in online shopping likely prompted the company to reverse its decision.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-store-website.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe page looks very similar to the Apple Store app on mobile devices and also contains information about refurbished products, trade-ins, and other helpful shopping resources.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/aug-5-2021\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/07/top-stories-magic-keyboard-touch-id/\">Top Stories: Magic Keyboard With Touch ID, New MacBook Pro and Apple Watches Incoming, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-new-macbook-pro-and-apple-watches-incoming-and-more.2306818/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_wgoq1VKev4:6kY6uEBA3ZE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_wgoq1VKev4:6kY6uEBA3ZE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_wgoq1VKev4\" />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2fcceed80cd67a7cadc2103086efd4e67017978683f1ca52b93f055d2cca0e33","category":"Apple"}
