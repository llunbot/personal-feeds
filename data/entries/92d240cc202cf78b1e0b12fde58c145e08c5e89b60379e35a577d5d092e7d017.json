Bush's single, abortive attempt to take climate change seriously. At the time, hydrogen was supposed to be <a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/06/20030625-6.html\">a fuel for vehicular transport</a>, an idea that still <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/12/toyota-not-giving-up-on-fuel-cell-but-now-banking-on-electric-too/\">hasn't really caught on</a>.</p>\n<p>But hydrogen appears to be enjoying a revival of sorts, appearing in the climate plans of nations like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c8d3e67-fb6c-4a74-b941-2fa8697d751c\">the UK</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-netherlands-investments/dutch-earmark-400-mln-for-green-hydrogen-development-idUSL1N2M219L\">Netherlands</a>. The US government is <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-launches-hydrogen-energy-earthshot-accelerate-breakthroughs-toward-net\">investing in research</a> on ways to produce hydrogen more cheaply. Are there reasons to think hydrogen power might be for real this time?</p>\n<p>A new report by research service BloombergNEF suggests that hydrogen is set for growth—but not in transport. And the growth has some aspects that don't actually make sense given the current economics.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785283#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785283&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"92d240cc202cf78b1e0b12fde58c145e08c5e89b60379e35a577d5d092e7d017","category":"Tech"}
