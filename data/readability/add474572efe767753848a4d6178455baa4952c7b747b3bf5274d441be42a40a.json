Based in Scotland, Endura has been producing top-notch foul-weather gear for a while now, and for this winter they’ve updated and expanded their MT500 Freezing Point collection.</p><p>The men’s MT500 Freezing Point jacket has seen some design updates, and Endura is now offering a women’s model as well. To keep your core cozy and warm the new MT500 Freezing Point Gilet has been added to the lineup, and their MT500 Freezing Point gloves promise to keep your hands dry and happy on chilly winter rides.</p><h2>Endura MT500 Freezing Point Jackets:</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151929/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-mens-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151929/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-mens-front.jpg\" alt=\"Endura MT500 Freezing Point Jacket, mens, front\" width=\"694\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151929/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-mens-front.jpg 694w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151929/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-mens-front-260x300.jpg 260w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151929/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-mens-front-104x120.jpg 104w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\"></a></p><p>Endura calls the MT500 Freezing Point their ‘ultimate winter MTB jacket’, but that hasn’t stopped them from making improvements to their latest models.

Endura provides warmth with Primaloft® Gold insulation in the sleeves, front torso and in the hood (and notes how the new inner face fabric elsewhere provides a little insulation while wicking moisture). This insulation offers 4-way stretch, an excellent weight-to-warmth ratio, breathability, packability, and water repellency.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151932/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-wmns-hood.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151932/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-wmns-hood.jpg\" alt=\"Endura MT500 Freezing Point Jacket, women's, hood\" width=\"751\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151932/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-wmns-hood.jpg 751w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151932/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-wmns-hood-282x300.jpg 282w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/29151932/Endura-MT500-Freezing-Point-jacket-wmns-hood-113x120.jpg 113w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\"></a></p><p>The jackets’ hood and collar have both seen notable updates; the hood’s adjustment system features revised compression routing and the collar now has printed graphics to highlight its internal toggles.
