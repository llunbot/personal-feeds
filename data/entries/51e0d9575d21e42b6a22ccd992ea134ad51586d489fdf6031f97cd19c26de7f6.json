{"title":"Chinese Finance Ministry Calls Trump’s Tariff Hikes ‘A Joke in the History of World Economics’","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-increase-tariffs-us-goods-125-up-84-finance-ministry-says-2025-04-11/","date":1744402455000,"content":"\n<p>Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The U.S. side’s imposition of excessively high tariffs on China\nseriously violates international economic and trade rules, runs\ncounter to basic economic principles and common sense, and is\nsimply an act of unilateral bullying and coercion,” China’s\nFinance Ministry said in a statement. [...]</p>\n\n<p>“Even if the U.S. continues to impose even higher tariffs, it\nwould no longer have any economic significance and would go down\nas a joke in the history of world economics,” the Finance\nMinistry’s statement added.</p>\n\n<p>“If the U.S. continues to play a numbers game with tariffs, China\nwill not respond,” it added. However it left the door open for\nBeijing to turn to other types of retaliation, reiterating that\nChina would fight the U.S. to the end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>None of this is funny at the moment, but Trump has beclowned himself with these impulsive nonsensical tariffs. No matter how this ends up, he will go down in history looking like a fool for this. In terms of history, what will be remembered in decades to come, he’d have far less embarrassed himself by shitting his pants in public. He came into office less than three months ago <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-producer-price-index-ppi-inflation-march/index.html\">with the US economy being the strongest in the world</a>, by far. Everything that’s happened since has been the direct result of his mad-king magical-thinking nonsense and the Republican party’s refusal to stand up to him.</p>\n\n<p>If Joe Biden had imposed these exact same tariff policies a year ago, for the exact same stated reasons, Republicans would have impeached him and called for his immediate ouster through <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxv\">Section 4 of the 25th Amendment</a> — and their actions, for once, would have been justified. These tariff policies are nuts and are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/economy/treasury-bonds-tariffs.html\">endangering the United States’s economic supremacy</a> while simultaneously hurting the entire world economy. No one in their right mind would do this, and the President of the United States needs to be a person in their right mind.</p>\n\n<p>Democrats and all other Trump opponents should immediately begin calling into question Trump’s mental fitness for office. This whole tariff saga is proof that he’s nuts. Just keep repeating that. He’s always been a little nutty but now he’s gone off the deep end. Don’t forget to reiterate that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump\">Trump’s father was suffering from severe dementia</a> when he was Trump’s age. Throw Biden under the bus: remind people that <a href=\"https://apple.news/ANs1GK_4ISEikICuDBenaSA\">we just saw</a> what happens when a mentally enfeebled 80-year-old<sup>*</sup> serves as President, and that under Trump it’s far worse. Biden was sleepy but steady; Trump is agitated and erratic. That’s far worse.</p>\n\n<p>Hammer the points — all true, all obvious — endlessly: Trump is too old; these tariffs are proof that he’s lost his mind; he’s hurting America badly; dementia runs in his family. Hammer it.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Keep calling him “80”; make his sycophants correct you that he’s “only” turning 79 in June.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/11/china-calls-trump-a-joke\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"51e0d9575d21e42b6a22ccd992ea134ad51586d489fdf6031f97cd19c26de7f6","category":"Tech"}
