This would make the power bank less travel-friendly as magnetic wireless charging is more immediate and requires no extra cable, but it does allow for much faster remote charging (18W vs 7.5W).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pop-up Watch charger feels robust when folded up for travel. It’s rated at just 2W so won’t fast-charge the Watch, but if you need juice on the go—before all your activity counts for nothing and notifications get cut off—it will supply enough power to get you to the next fixed power socket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5W Qi AirPods charging pad is located not on the power bank but on the wired charging base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foldable, the charging base stand is also portable, being compact and lightweight. The whole package weighs 335g: the base stand is 116g and the power bank 219g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://alogic.co/products/lift-4-in-1-magsafe-compatible-wireless-charging-10000mah-power-bank&amp;xcust=1-1-2216927-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Alogic Lift 4-in-1 MagSafe Compatible Wireless Charging 10,000mAh Power Bank</a> ($99.99 / £89.99) is a similar compact solution of high-capacity power bank, MagSafe-compatible wireless charger, and Apple Watch charger. It doesn’t have a base unit and therefore no stand or AirPods charging pad, although it does have two USB ports so you could charge using a cable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lift MagSafe Power Bank, below left, is smaller but a little fatter than the OneGo, below right. Both feature kickstands and Apple Watch charging modules. Both are around the same weight.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Lift-vs-OneAdaptr-OneGo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Alogic Lift MagSafe power bank vs OneAdaptr OneGo MagsSafe power bank\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Lift-vs-OneAdaptr-OneGo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Lift-vs-OneAdaptr-OneGo.jpg?resize=300%2C161&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Lift-vs-OneAdaptr-OneGo.jpg?resize=768%2C412&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The wireless charging speeds are not the fastest (7.5W iPhone, 2W Apple Watch) but these are largely compromises based on the portability of the power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10,000mAh battery capacity is high, and in our tests we managed to get 1.5x recharges of an iPhone 15 Pro, which is impressive, although not market leading. That’s about the same as with the similar iPhone/Watch charging Alogic Lift power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have tested and reviewed 10K battery packs that offer greater charging power: the Baseus Magnetic Power Bank (187%) and Benks MagClap StandGo (160%) both offer better performance but lack the extra USB port and integrated Apple Watch charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a few niggles in our testing. Getting the recharging started isn’t as intuitive as other power banks and the user manual isn’t very clear on the process. You need to push the on/off button before placing your iPhone on to the power bank and then push it again, rather than just have a one-push operation. You quickly get used to it but it is initially confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read our full roundups of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\">best MagSafe chargers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html\">best MagSafe power banks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneAdaptr OneGo is $89 / £72 / CA$123 / AU$138 / €74,95 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://oneadaptr.com/products/onego&amp;xcust=1-1-2216927-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">direct from OneAdaptr</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a multi-device charger this is an attractive price for such a set of fixed and portable charging solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closest alternative solution, the Alogic Lift 4-in-1 MagSafe Power Bank, costs $99.99 / £89.99 / CA$129.99 / AU$99.99 / €109,99.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneAdaptr-OneGo-stand-power-bank.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo charging stand and magnetic power bank\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneAdaptr-OneGo-stand-power-bank.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneAdaptr-OneGo-stand-power-bank.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneAdaptr-OneGo-stand-power-bank.jpg?resize=768%2C495&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneAdaptr OneGo is either a power bank that transforms into a desk-based charging stand or a desk-based charging stand that detaches into a portable power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power bank’s ability to charge not just an iPhone but also the Apple Watch is also seen in a few other chargers, but none at this price point and none with a stand that can also charge your AirPods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneGo is an impressive multifunctional Apple device charger that is reasonably priced and performs well.
