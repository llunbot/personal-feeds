Despite numerous attempts to solve this fundamental vulnerability—the digital equivalent of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/\">whispering secret instructions</a> to override a system's intended behavior—no one has found a reliable solution. Until now, perhaps.</p>\n<p>Google DeepMind has <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813\">unveiled CaMeL</a> (CApabilities for MachinE Learning), a new approach to stopping prompt-injection attacks that abandons the failed strategy of having AI models police themselves. Instead, CaMeL treats language models as fundamentally untrusted components within a secure software framework, creating clear boundaries between user commands and potentially malicious content.</p>\n<p>The new paper grounds CaMeL's design in established software security principles like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity\">Control Flow Integrity</a> (CFI), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control\">Access Control</a>, and <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_flow_control\">Information Flow Control</a> (IFC), adapting decades of security engineering wisdom to the challenges of LLMs.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/researchers-claim-breakthrough-in-fight-against-ais-frustrating-security-hole/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/researchers-claim-breakthrough-in-fight-against-ais-frustrating-security-hole/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0416d5ad7f93e0d64c977953fc00e8b1dcfaca268e3843d8f1b465e6948628dc","category":"Tech"}
