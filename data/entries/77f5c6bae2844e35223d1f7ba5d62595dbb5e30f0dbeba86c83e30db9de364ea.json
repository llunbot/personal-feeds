Ron DeSantis of Florida\n“anti-business” for his scorched-earth attempt to tighten\noversight of the company’s theme park resort near Orlando. Last\nmonth, when Disney sued the governor and his allies for what it\ncalled “a targeted campaign of government retaliation,” the\ncompany made clear that $17 billion in planned investment in Walt\nDisney World was on the line.</p>\n\n<p>“Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people, and\npay more taxes, or not?” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief\nexecutive, said on an earnings-related conference call with\nanalysts last week.</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, Mr. Iger and Josh D’Amaro, Disney’s theme park and\nconsumer products chairman, showed that they were not bluffing,\npulling the plug on a nearly $1 billion office complex that was\nscheduled for construction in Orlando. It would have brought more\nthan 2,000 jobs to the region, with $120,000 as the average\nsalary, according to an estimate from the Florida Department of\nEconomic Opportunity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Vote for Republicans, they’re good for business.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/18/disney-florida-pulls-plug\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"77f5c6bae2844e35223d1f7ba5d62595dbb5e30f0dbeba86c83e30db9de364ea","category":"Tech"}
