Typing in “Open drawer,” then “Look in drawer,” then “Take brochures,” in the year 2024, on a computer that can generate a 4K 3D model of the Acropolis if I ask it to? Is that really what <i><a href=\"https://www.thecrimsondiamond.com/\">The Crimson Diamond</a></i> asks of us?</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Release trailer for <em>The Crimson Diamond</em> </p></div>\n<p>Yes, it is, and solo developer/writer/producer Julia Minamata is right to ask it. If you have text-prompt adventures from the likes of Sierra in your mental library (like, say, <em><a href=\"https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_colonels_bequest\">The Colonel's Bequest)</a></em>, or if you’re willing to meet the parser halfway, it will work. <i>The Crimson Diamond</i>’s parser is fairly agile, accepting a range of nouns and verbs in most circumstances. You can still use arrow keys and a mouse to move and click a few useful shortcuts. And the parser has shortcuts, like typing “n” to look at your quest-tracking notebook or “o d” or “o c” for the very common actions of opening a door or cabinet.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of cabinets and drawers in this game because it’s set in northern Ontario, Canada, in 1914. You are Nancy Maple, a junior geologist eager for some field work, sent by your museum to the mining town of Crimson to investigate a diamond that fell out of a river fish’s guts. Everything goes wrong with your trip, and you’re on your own to investigate this town, its odd inhabitants and visitors, and, eventually, a crime that may or may not have to do with potential diamonds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043870#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043870&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"28bfc3e0b3abeac27c55c3773b8218da7381921a7f9de9ea66e41dcefe629cac","category":"Tech"}
