Look, a lot of\nit depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There clearly is no “invasion”. An invasion hasn’t happened here since the War of 1812, when the British got us good and burned down the White House and set fire to the Capitol.</p>\n\n<p>You can say, <em>Hey man, look, I’m with you Grubes, but I don’t go to Daring Fireball to read Trump stuff</em>. I swear I’m trying — I’ve been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag\">trying since before he took office again</a> — to pay attention only to what Trump and his lickspittle loathsome hateful idiot minions <em>do</em>, not just what they <em>say</em>. But when they even <em>say</em> they’re “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, justified by an “invasion” that obviously doesn’t exist, I think it’s on everyone to just stand up and say “Fuck that. This is America.”</p>\n\n<p>I can’t wait to see Stephen Miller in prison.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/09/trump-habeas-corpus\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6e2faaec2e91f51021cc8e1dc1a7e6d06a021a9d71fd38adb2846d333d3fb056","category":"Tech"}
