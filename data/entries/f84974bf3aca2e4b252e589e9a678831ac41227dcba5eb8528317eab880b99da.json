The Zabrina gravel fork is inspired by the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1991-team-fat-chance-yo-eddy/\" target=\"_blank\">Yo Eddy! forks</a>, and designed to be close to the same specs as the Enve Composites Gravel Disc Fork. It is an excellent option for those who want a steel fork for their gravel bike that currently has a carbon fork. This Zabrina fork comes bedazzled with three cargo cage bosses drilled along the length of each Columbus 1″ tapered fork blade and bosses into the top of the segmented crown for easy rack mounting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Zabrina-Ti-Flat-Bar-Gravel-Bike-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Zabrina-Ti-Flat-Bar-Gravel-Bike-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Zabrina-Ti-Flat-Bar-Gravel-Bike-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-Zabrina-Ti-Flat-Bar-Gravel-Bike-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<div><em>Zach’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-made-bike-show-part-04/#:~:text=Zabrina%20Cycles%20Flat%20Bar%20Gravel%20Bike\" target=\"_blank\">2024 MADE Bike Show Flat Bar Gravel</a> rocked a similar fork…</em></div>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>$485</li>\n<li>1060 grams with an uncut steerer</li>\n<li>Single stage black powder coat (two-stage or custom colors are extra)</li>\n<li>Columbus 1″ tapered fork legs</li>\n<li>400mm axle to crown length, which is 5mm longer than the Enve fork for added downtube/fork crown clearance</li>\n<li>50mm offset</li>\n<li>A 1 1/4″ crown race seat can be easily adapted to 1 1/2″ with an oversized crown race adapter.</li>\n<li>Cargo bosses</li>\n<li>Rack bosses</li>\n<li>Made in Oakland, California</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zabrinacycles.com/contact-8\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Zabrina Cycles</a> for ordering.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/zabrina-cycles-segmented-gravel-fork/\">Zabrina Cycles New Segmented Gravel Fork</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f84974bf3aca2e4b252e589e9a678831ac41227dcba5eb8528317eab880b99da","category":"Cycling"}
