Apple says that customers affected by this issue should update to iPadOS 17.4.1 to fix the problem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior to iPadOS 17.4.1, Apple was suggesting that ‌iPad‌ users unable to scan QR codes with the Camera app and other third-party apps use the Code Scanner function in the Control Center.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's release notes did not mention the bug fix, perhaps due to the limited number of ‌iPad‌ models that are impacted. iPadOS 17.4.1 also added other unspecified bug fixes and security improvements.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/ios-17-4-1-qr-code-scanning-bug/\">iPadOS 17.4.1 Fixes QR Code Scanning Bug</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-17-4-1-fixes-qr-code-scanning-bug.2422469/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f4c7b5c8cbf413d7ede5aeae3e065ab32e40e6dcddbd4c5552930b8b0b0ac490","category":"Apple"}
