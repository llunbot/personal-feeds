{"title":"Kino 1.0","link":"https://www.lux.camera/introducing-kino-pro-video-camera/","date":1717118886000,"content":"\n<p>New from Lux, makers of Halide:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today we’re excited to launch <a href=\"http://www.shotwithkino.com/\">Kino</a>, a powerful filmmaking\napp for beginners and experts alike. As say they say in\nscreenwriting, “Show, Don’t tell,” so let’s walk through a few of\nthe tent-pole features in our huge 1.0 release. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Last fall, everything changed when Apple introduced “Log” video\nsupport on the iPhone 15 Pro. When recording in this format,\nyour iPhone saves a version of your video with most of the\noriginal information, and <em>before</em> any creative decisions have\nbeen applied. Using that cake analogy, it’s like the iPhone now\nsaves all the ingredients that make up a cake, but leaves you to\ndo the baking.</p>\n\n<p>That’s great if you’re a skilled baker… er… colorist… but it’s\nchallenging for most of us. Out of the box, Apple Log footage\nlooks really flat. It’s not meant to look good. It’s meant to be\nedited later.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you didn’t have to edit? What if you could use all\nthat powerful extra color data and get a cinematic look with\none tap?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a delightful prosumer balance Kino strikes. Preset color grades include some from Evan Schneider, Tyler Stalman, Stu Maschwitz, Sandwich Video, and Kevin Ong.</p>\n\n<p>And I just adore some of the UI touches in the app, like drawing a big red border around the entire display when recording footage. It’s like those big red lights in TV studios.</p>\n\n<p>Kino is going to cost $20 as a one-time purchase, but is available at launch for just $10. What a great deal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> Lux cofounders Sebastiaan de With and Ben Sandofsky <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/10/27/ep-387\">were my guests on The Talk Show back in October</a>, and dropped some hints about what is now Kino.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/30/kino\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0c6b91a4263466719442e8e268c01a84e98edaf65e2b73bedb9533d163249d8a","category":"Tech"}
