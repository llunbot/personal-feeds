The main change in this beta is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/ios-17-1-action-button-tweak/\">tweaked behavior for the Action button</a> on iPhone 15 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-Feature-Fall-Muted.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\niOS 17.1 is expected to be released to the public later this month alongside watchOS 10.1 and more. We've put together a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/ios-17-1-features-list/\">list of eight new features and changes included in the software update</a>. Notably, there is a tweak to cellular performance for the iPhone 12 in France due to a regulatory ruling, and regulators there have revealed that the update will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/ios-17-1-launch-by-october-24/\">made available to the public by October 24</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 16 Pro Expected to Support Faster '5G Advanced'</h2>\r<br />\nThe next-generation iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/\">equipped with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem</a> for faster and more power efficient 5G, according to tech analyst Jeff Pu. However, he expects the lower-end iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models to stick with the Snapdragon X70.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"3532\" height=\"1986\" />\r<br />\nQualcomm says the Snapdragon X75 modem <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/\">supports the latest \"5G Advanced\" standard</a>, which is described as \"the next phase of 5G\" and an \"evolution towards 6G.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Will Apple Release New Macs Soon? Here's What the Latest Rumors Say</h2>\r<br />\nApple often releases new Macs in the fall, but whether that will happen this year is far from certain. It's the second week of October now, and there is still no sign that Apple will be hosting an event this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/apple-silicon-mac-lineup-wwdc-2022-feature-blue.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nTo help clear things up, this week we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/will-apple-release-new-macs-this-year/\">recapped all of the latest rumors about Macs</a>.
