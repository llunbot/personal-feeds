Ivan Morozov, a Moscow-based lawyer, <a href=\"https://tass.ru/ekonomika/22263289\">told the state-run\nTASS newswire</a> that a Russian court ordered the tech giant to\nrestore Russian media accounts on YouTube, a Google-owned company.</p>\n\n<p>He said that Google’s failure to do so has resulted in a fine that\nhad been regularly doubling for years. There is no cap on the\ntotal, the lawyer said. Morozov, who did not immediately respond\nto a request for comment from Business Insider, said that the\ncumulative amount has now reached 2 undecillion rubles — an\nalmost unfathomable figure.</p>\n\n<p>At the current exchange rate, the fine is equivalent to about\n$20.6 decillion. A decillion is a figure followed by 33 zeros — which, in this case, puts the fine at\n$20,604,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This certainly makes the EU’s fines based on a percentage of companies’ global revenue seem fair and reasonable.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/30/russia-google-fine\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d99ea800b7d1f5bf72d29bb3c0bcf93754de51c2d091e8c499dfc029ba53d6bd","category":"Tech"}
