Microsoft says that the reformulated version of Teams is \"up to two times faster while using 50 percent less memory\" on Windows systems. That sound you hear is old and underspecced work PCs in offices around the world breathing a sigh of relief.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973717#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973717&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"590227320ad199e7f47003dec1132a8788c7b7af2b8f2d08b544c66ed5f71ad3","category":"Tech"}
