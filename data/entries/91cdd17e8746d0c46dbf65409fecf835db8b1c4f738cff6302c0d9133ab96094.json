Thankfully, you can still get one and it’s on sale right now: Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Tracker/dp/B0CHX92WB8/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">41mm Apple Watch Series 9 for $329</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Tracker/dp/B0CHX6SF1J/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the 45mm model for $359</a>, a savings of $70 each and matching the lowest price we’ve seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 has the same 41mm and 45mm displays as the Series 8 with two new features: an S9 chip that’s faster and smarter with a new four-core Neural Engine, and the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2093434/how-to-double-tap-gesture-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2.html\">double-tap gesture</a> that lets you control apps without touching the screen. Otherwise, it’s got the same array of sensors—ECG, heart rate, temperature, and the aforementioned blood oxygen—as well as all-day battery life, 50 meters of water resistance, Emergency SOS and Crash Detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced a firmware change that will disable the blood-oxygen sensor on new Apple Watches beginning January 18, so they might be hard to find in a few weeks. So grab one at this all-time low price while you still can.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"91cdd17e8746d0c46dbf65409fecf835db8b1c4f738cff6302c0d9133ab96094","category":"Apple"}
