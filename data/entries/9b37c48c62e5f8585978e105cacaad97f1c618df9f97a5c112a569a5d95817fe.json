{"title":"Enduro Introduces MAX Solid Lube Suspension Pivot Bearings","link":"https://theradavist.com/enduro-max-solid-lube-suspension-pivot-bearings/","date":1728475228000,"content":"<p><em>The motion of suspension pivots is not like the motion of a hub or bottom bracket or derailleur pulley. Pivots are not constantly spinning full circles, and they don’t need to have particularly light action. They need to survive rocking back and forth just a few degrees, thousands of times a ride. And ideally, they need to last long enough that you’re not pressing them out of your frame every season. That’s one reason some bike brands have opted for <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ibis-ripmo-v3-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">bushings instead of bearings in some pivot locations.</a> There’s more surface area contact, and potentially lower maintenance.

That polymer is microscopically porous and infused with a special lubricant that is drawn out to coat the metal surfaces when the bearing is in motion. And the races are given a penetrating Black Oxide treatment for smoothness and longevity. It’s all locked behind double-lip seals to keep out contaminants, though the polymer structure leaves very little room for those contaminants if they ever make their way in.</p>\n<p>Just like Enduro’s existing line of MAX suspension bearings, the new MAX Solid Lube bearings pack the most ball bearings possible to share the load. And the races are cut especially deep to further increase surface contact and add lateral stiffness. Enduro is backing up the MAX Solid Lube bearings with a two-year warranty. They’re currently available in ten popular sizes, which you can identify by matching the four-digit code on the seal. The Max Solid Lube bearings aren’t cheap at $49 apiece, but for anyone whose extreme climate or high mileage has them replacing pivot bearings regularly, it may be a worthy investment.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://cycling.endurobearings.com/collections/suspension-bearings?pf_t_material=Material%3ASolid+Lube\" target=\"_blank\">Enduro</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/enduro-max-solid-lube-suspension-pivot-bearings/\">Enduro Introduces MAX Solid Lube Suspension Pivot Bearings</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9b37c48c62e5f8585978e105cacaad97f1c618df9f97a5c112a569a5d95817fe","category":"Cycling"}
