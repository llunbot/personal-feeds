The go-to advice while this broken update is out there is to not reboot.</p>\n<p>The bulletin says that a new build, version 91.0.4472.167, is rolling out now to fix the issue, but it could take a \"few days\" to hit everyone. Users affected by the bad update can either wait for the device to update again or \"powerwash\" their device—meaning wipe all the local data—to get logged in. Chrome OS is primarily cloud-based, so if you're not doing something advanced like running Linux apps, this solution presents less of an inconvenience than it would on other operating systems. Still, some users are complaining about lost data.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782237#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782237&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"74068c2e04cc17b92a1d9e4292138bc0e83846c869824a223964005924077e27","category":"Tech"}
