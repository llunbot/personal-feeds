{"title":"iPhone Fold: New Leak Corroborates Camera Setup on Outer Display","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/iphone-fold-camera-setup-outer-display/","date":1744796748000,"content":"Further details have emerged about the camera system on Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone, informally dubbed the \"iPhone Fold.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nExpected to launch next year, Apple's book-style foldable is rumored to feature a 7.8-inch crease-free internal display and a 5.5-inch external screen. According to industry analyst <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the device will include a dual-lens rear camera along with front-facing cameras usable in both folded and unfolded states, ensuring comprehensive camera functionality in any configuration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile previous reports noted that the unfolded state will utilize an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/\">under-screen camera (USC)</a>, there was less information about the front camera in the folded state – until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223835009454&amp;navType=by\">Korean news aggregator yeux1122</a>, citing an unknown Weibo-based source, Apple has opted for a hole-punch front-facing camera on the outer display. The design is said to be \"almost identical to current foldables\" on the market, such as Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold (pictured below). The blog also cited previously revealed information on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">display sizes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/\">screen resolutions</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt remains unclear whether the hole-punch will be visible during active use or encased in a smaller Dynamic Island, but Face ID is not expected to be part of the equation. Instead, Apple is believed to have <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">integrated Touch ID into the side button</a>, in order to conserve internal space for other components.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/google-pixel-9-fold.jpg\" alt=\"pixel\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nKuo says final hardware specifications will be locked in during the second quarter of this year (April 1 - June 30), suggesting some elements are still subject to change. However, analyst Jeff Pu claims the device has already entered the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/\">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn – a critical stage in Apple's product development cycle – indicating that key specs may already be finalized.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/foldable-iphone-expected-2026-rumored-features/\">Foldable iPhone Expected Next Year: All the Rumored Features So Far</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nMass production is reportedly scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2026, with a release expected late next year. The first-generation foldable iPhone is expected to carry a price tag between <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">$2,000</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/foldable-iphone-to-cost-1000-more-than-pro-max/\">$2,300</a>. A second-generation model is reportedly already in the pipeline, with mass production planned for the second half of 2027.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/iphone-fold-camera-setup-outer-display/\">iPhone Fold: New Leak Corroborates Camera Setup on Outer Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-fold-new-leak-corroborates-camera-setup-on-outer-display.2455408/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"80db89ad1f3950b8e3484c89ba9bc84a1ddb09a150413d632af5ab1b24510e7f","category":"Apple"}
