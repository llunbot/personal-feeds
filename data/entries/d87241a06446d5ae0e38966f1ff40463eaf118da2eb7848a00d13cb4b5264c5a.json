This time around, the new pedal features more grip, more sizes, and now sports a lifetime warranty.

After years of being the pedal choice for riders of all levels, Chester was ready for an update. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feedback from their community of riders told them that they wanted a pedal with a more concave feel and improved grip. The riders also said they wanted the pedal available in multiple sizes… Race Face listened. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They addressed these pain points and made additional improvements by considering the following factors; pedal shape, platform size, pins, and Q-factor. The result? “The best darn composite pedal ever made by Race Face”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s New with Chester? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-orange-profile-e1721668461534.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"211\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-orange-profile-e1721668461534.jpeg\" alt=\"Race Face New Chester Pedal orange profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-orange-profile-e1721668461534.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-orange-profile-e1721668461534-297x49.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-orange-profile-e1721668461534-120x20.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-orange-profile-e1721668461534-768x127.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pedal Shape:</strong><br />“<em>Our previous iteration had a bulge in the center of the pedal platform to house the pedal spindle. Many composite pedals need more material in this area to achieve the desired strength (aluminum is stronger and requires less metal to achieve the same strength). The drawback of the bulge is an insecure, convex feel. With the new Chester, we slimmed down the spindle housing without compromising strength, almost eliminating the bulge entirely and resulting in a more concave and secure feel</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-Green-platform-e1721668279791.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"580\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-Green-platform-e1721668279791.jpeg\" alt=\"Race Face New Chester Pedal Green platform\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-Green-platform-e1721668279791.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-Green-platform-e1721668279791-297x135.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-Green-platform-e1721668279791-120x54.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-Green-platform-e1721668279791-768x348.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-fit-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"543\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-fit-chart.jpg\" alt=\"Race Face New Chester Pedal fit chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-fit-chart.jpg 543w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-fit-chart-297x79.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-fit-chart-120x32.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Platform Size:</strong><br />“<em>We made the new Chester in two sizes, Small (105 x 100mm) and Large (115 x 110mm) to better suit the needs of all riders.

The pins were strategically placed for a more consistent grip around the entire pedal circumference and a more concave feel. The metal pins also have smaller, threadless tips, which improve grip and let riders reposition their feet as needed. Threadless pin tips also make</em> pin removal easier for when riders inevitably replace them, as well as making the pins less damaging to the <em>skin in the event of a “shinner.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-better-q-factor.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-better-q-factor.jpeg\" alt=\"Race Face New Chester Pedal better q-factor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-better-q-factor.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-better-q-factor-297x165.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-better-q-factor-120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Race-Face-New-Chester-Pedal-better-q-factor-768x427.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q-Factor</strong>:<br />“<em>We eliminated the wrench flats from the pedal spindle to reduce Q-factor, meaning the rider’s feet will sit closer to the cranks.
