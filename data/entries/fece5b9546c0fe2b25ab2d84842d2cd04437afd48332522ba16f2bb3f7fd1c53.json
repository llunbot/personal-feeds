We've got to hand it to Atari here—as a PR gambit for a new game, porting a rough version of your game to a 46-year-old game console and then giving it a physical release complete with box and manual is pretty good.</p>\n<p>Atari is billing this release as \"the first 2600 cartridge launch for a new Atari title since 1990,\" though there have also been some limited-run cartridge releases for games like <a href=\"https://atari.com/products/yars-return\">2005's <em>Yars' Return</em></a>. There were also a few new 2600-inspired games and remakes, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/why-i-cant-put-down-ataris-latest-nostalgic-retro-gaming-throwback/\"><em>Vctr Sctr</em></a>, in Atari's 50th-anniversary collection, which also got a physical release on modern consoles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947415#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947415&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fece5b9546c0fe2b25ab2d84842d2cd04437afd48332522ba16f2bb3f7fd1c53","category":"Tech"}
