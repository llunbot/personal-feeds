The second-generation <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zzvu7b\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch SE</a> is also on sale, matching its lowest tracked price and adding even more value to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/the-8-best-fitness-trackers-for-each-type-of-user/2/#h1\" target=\"_blank\">best fitness tracker</a> for most people.

Equipped with 512GB of storage, 16GB RAM, and Apple's M2 Pro system-on-a-chip, this model is well-equipped to satisfy creatives. As we noted <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/m2-pro-mac-mini-review-apples-goldilocks-desktop-for-semi-professionals/\" target=\"_blank\">in our review</a>, it fills the gap well between the lowest-end Mac Studio and the previous-generation M1-equipped Mac mini. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Mdsmp7\" target=\"_blank\">$50 discount</a> matches the lowest price we've tracked on the M2 Pro-equipped Mac mini.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-MacBook-Air-front-open.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Open up the MacBook Air, and it looks quite a bit like the 14-inch MacBook Pro from this angle.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-MacBook-Air-front-open-640x502.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-MacBook-Air-front-open-1280x1004.jpeg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-MacBook-Air-front-open.jpeg\">Open up the MacBook Air, and it looks quite a bit like the 14-inch MacBook Pro from this angle.</a> (credit: Samuel Axon)</p></div>\n<h3>Apple MacBook Air for <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cjsFN35TFJk\" target=\"_blank\">$1,049</a> ($1,200)</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cjsFN35TFJk\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Air</a> is the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/best-macbook-buying-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">best Mac laptop for most types of users</a>.
