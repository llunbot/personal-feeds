Based roughly on the Wegweiser EVO carbon road wheels, the Pfadfinder EVO can accommodate wider 40mm tires, in-line with the trend for higher volume tires.</p><h2>Lightweight Pfadfinder EVO</h2><p>The new Lightweight Pfadfinder EVO wheelset is disc only, with carbon rims braced by 20 carbon spokes, front and rear. Based on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/10/24/lightweight-evo-wheels-evolve-w-disc-specific-tubeless-ready-carbon-wheels-for-road-cx-gravel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wegweiser EVO</a>, the Pfadfinder EVO gets a 36mm deep rim is said to have a low sensitivity to side winds. The 18.2mm internal width rim (24mm outer) is said to allow the fitment of tires up to 40mm wide for additional riding comfort, but down to 23mm wide too.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp.jpg\" alt=\"lightweight pfadfinder evo carbon rim gravel riding 40mm tires cfrp\" width=\"1600\" height=\"725\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp-297x135.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp-800x363.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp-120x54.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp-768x348.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033623/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-rim-cfrp-1536x696.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The carbon rims themselves are made up of special high-modulus CFRP fibers (carbon fibre reinforced polymers) with the layup specifically optimized for significantly increased robustness.

This was developed to be stronger and safer, able to withstand the braking heat generated at the hub due to the disc brakes. It uses a hub shell with 5 sides instead of one that is round. This means the hub shell is held in place not only with the bond of the epoxy, but also with a mechanical bond of the flanges around the pentagon shell.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset.jpg\" alt=\"lightweight pfadfinder evo carbon disc gravel wheel sram campagnolo shimano standards\" width=\"1600\" height=\"793\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset-297x147.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset-800x397.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset-120x59.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset-768x381.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17033616/lightweight-pfadfinder-evo-carbon-gravel-disc-wheelset-1536x761.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Pfadfinder EVO will be available in standard and Schwarz ED.
