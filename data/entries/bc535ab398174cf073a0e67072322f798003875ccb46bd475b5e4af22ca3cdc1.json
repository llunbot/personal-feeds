In addition to banning Google's exclusive default deals, cutting off Google's control of the world's most popular browser may be necessary, sources suggested, to level the playing field for rivals.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the DOJ intends to ask for a range of other remedies, Bloomberg reported, all of them discussed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/googles-ai-deals-could-hurt-its-search-monopoly-appeal-expert-says/\">in a court filing last month</a>. These include imposing data licensing requirements and requiring more transparency for advertisers on where their ads appear, as well as requiring \"measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system,\" sources said. Those measures will likely stop Google from hoarding user data for both search results and AI products, with the DOJ seemingly paving the way for more users to opt their content out of AI training.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/report-doj-wants-to-force-google-chrome-sale-android-de-bundling/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/report-doj-wants-to-force-google-chrome-sale-android-de-bundling/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc535ab398174cf073a0e67072322f798003875ccb46bd475b5e4af22ca3cdc1","category":"Tech"}
