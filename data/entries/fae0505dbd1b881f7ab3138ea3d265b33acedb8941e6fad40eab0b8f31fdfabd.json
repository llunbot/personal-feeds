The move came just a day after news broke that the Food and Drug Administration rejected the treatment, despite <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/mdma-aka-ecstasy-submitted-to-fda-as-part-of-ptsd-therapy/\">positive results reported from two Phase III clinical trials</a>.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the company developing the therapy, Lykos Therapeutics, <a href=\"https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-08-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-Complete-Response-Letter-for-Midomafetamine-Capsules-for-PTSD\">announced that it had received a rejection letter from the FDA</a>. Lykos said the letter echoed the numerous <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/fdas-review-of-mdma-for-ptsd-highlights-study-bias-and-safety-concerns/\">concerns raised previously by the agency</a> and its expert advisory committee, which, in June, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/\">voted </a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/\">overwhelmingly </a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/\">against approving the therapy</a>. The FDA and its advisers identified flaws in the design of the clinical trials, missing data, and a variety of biases in people involved with the trials, including an alleged cult-like support of psychedelics. Lykos is a commercial spinoff of the psychedelic advocacy nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</p>\n<p>FDA advisers also noted the <a href=\"https://qz.com/1809184/psychedelic-therapy-has-a-sexual-abuse-problem-3\">public allegations of a sexual assault</a> of a trial participant during a Phase II trial by an unlicensed therapist providing the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042683#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042683&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fae0505dbd1b881f7ab3138ea3d265b33acedb8941e6fad40eab0b8f31fdfabd","category":"Tech"}
