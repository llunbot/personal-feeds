Paul Components has been making high-end, USA-made bike parts in Chico since 1989. Their products are full of precision machining, being made with aerospace-like tolerances. Their parts are not only beautifully engineered to work very well, but they are beautiful to look at as well and carry a high bling factor – their <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/mounting-solutions/dropper-trigger/\">Dropper Trigger</a> is no exception. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-semi-hero-e1715979691390.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-semi-hero-e1715979691390.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger semi hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-semi-hero-e1715979691390.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-semi-hero-e1715979691390-297x158.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-semi-hero-e1715979691390-120x64.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-semi-hero-e1715979691390-768x408.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Haro Saguaro 1 I am reviewing came spec’d with a TranzX Dropper. I did not like the stock lever it came with. It felt hard to push and strained when actuating the post. So, I reached out to Paul Components to review their version of a dropper lever, the Dropper Trigger. And, yeah, I got one in gold, ’cause well, it’s gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outta The Box</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger. up close jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger.-up-close-jpeg-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The blingy beauty of the gold anodized Dropper Trigger caught my eye instantly upon opening the box. The machining is perfect with meticulous attention to detail. This is something I’ve come to expect from Paul Components and sets the brand apart from others. The Dropper Trigger weight is feathery at 40g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-mounted-e1715979940471.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"964\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-mounted-e1715979940471.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-mounted-e1715979940471.jpeg 964w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-mounted-e1715979940471-297x278.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-mounted-e1715979940471-120x112.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-mounted-e1715979940471-768x719.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Quality </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger double cartridge sealed bearings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-double-cartridge-sealed-bearings-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>You can see the ergonomic curvature of the paddle here. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After putting the Dropper Trigger prototypes through rigorous testing for over a year, the final version ends up with some unique features. The first is dual-stacked sealed cartridge bearings in the pivot. This eliminates any pivot slop, boasts super light trigger action, and provides a long serviceable life. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-exploded.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"763\" height=\"749\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-exploded.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger exploded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-exploded.jpeg 763w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-exploded-297x292.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-exploded-120x118.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t touch on the precision of bike parts that come from Paul Components enough. I mentioned earlier the aerospace-like tolerances that their components have. For example, the Dropper Trigger is machined in Chico, California from 6061 American aluminum to 0.0005″ tolerance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger flip flop mounting option\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-flip-flop-mounting-option-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The cable can be installed in either direction…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a pinch bolt <em>and</em> a cable head recess which allows you to run your dropper cable in either direction. The paddle is curved for ergonomics. The Dropper Trigger has a hinged clamp for easy installation on or removal from the handlebars. Finally, there is a nice barrel adjuster for a quick way to remove slack from the system or fine-tune the cable tension. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Operating the Lever and Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger paddle P\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-paddle-P-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The installation went flawlessly, and the Paul Dropper Trigger operates the TranzX dropper smoothly with a very light actuation, thanks to the stacked sealed cartridge bearings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think this needs to be a long-term review, as I feel that you either like a dropper lever or you don’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger Easy installation\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-Easy-installation-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paul Dropper Trigger has been great on the Haro so far, and the ergonomic paddle shape feels flat and positive when engaging it with your thumb.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Component Engineering Dropper Trigger USA paddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Component-Engineering-Dropper-Trigger-USA-paddle-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The build quality, attention to detail, and unique features ensure that this component will be as long-lived and serviceable as everything that comes from Paul Components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paul Dropper Trigger comes in two clamp sizes, 22.2 (MTB) and 31.8 (drop bars).
