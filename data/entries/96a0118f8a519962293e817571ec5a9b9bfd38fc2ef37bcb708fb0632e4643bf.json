This is the global HQ of Gtechniq, a game-changing pioneer in ‘smart surface science’ that is disrupting the bike industry with its innovative range of premium bike maintenance and cleaning products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Northamptonshire’s blend of rich history and cutting-edge research makes it a fitting home for a brand that proudly fuses heritage and innovation. Gtechniq has been a force in the prestige car and marine industries for over 20 years, building a trusted reputation for keeping luxury cars and yachts (plus private jets and helicopters) in pristine condition. But this heritage is built on a fierce commitment to scientific progress, with products shaped by quantum physics, molecular science and nanotechnology. And that is why the brand’s entry into cycling is a head-turning move. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Gtechniq’s flagship bike product is its ground-breaking Bike Ceramic, which leaves an ultra-slick invisible layer (70 times thinner than a human hair) that prevents dirt, oil and salt from sticking to your bike. Unlike standard sprays and waxes, this ceramic is made from silanes – silicon compounds – which form a tight chemical bond with the lacquer on your frame and wheels to create a long-lasting hydrophobic layer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transforms your bike into a ‘smart surface’, so water beads on the surface easily roll or wash off. The brand also has a full suite of elite bike maintenance products, including a Drivetrain Degreaser and a Bike Clean spray, to ensure your bike remains an enduring object of beauty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bucket list</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a cycling industry shaped by computational fluid dynamics and wind-tunnel testing, cleaning products have remained oddly neglected. ‘Cyclists are happily dropping £10,000 on a bike, but they don’t have much choice in terms of quality products to look after it,’ explains Gtechniq managing director Rob Earle, who used to enjoy riding up the Col de la Madone when he was based in France for business. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03-647x970.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Earle found the branding of bike maintenance companies ‘underwhelming’ and their products of poor quality: ‘We wanted to bring our expertise from the automotive and marine world into cycling, with a range of premium, bike-specific products.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee Kennedy, Gtechniq’s senior formulation chemist, says cyclists will love the tech. ‘Road cyclists get the science, aesthetics and performance,’ he says. ‘Some bikes cost more than cars, and they look amazing, so you want to look after them.

Rob Foster, Gtechniq’s bike business development manager, is a keen cyclist, so he appreciates the feeling of seeing your new bike in the shop for the first time. ‘Our products are about giving you that “new bike day” look,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Far East and Ferraris</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Gtechniq’s 30,000ft2 Northamptonshire home – which features an on-site lab, a new 10,000ft2 warehouse and production machines capable of filling 7,000 bottles per hour – products are formulated, tested, packaged and then shipped around the world. On the wall of Earle’s office is a world map with red dots, located everywhere from Costa Rica to Taiwan, which mark the 55 countries to which the brand ships products. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05-647x970.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Gtechniq’s story began in Hong Kong in 2001. Dr Drew Gill, a British quantum physicist, was fed up with the poor performance of the protective waxes and polymers his firm was promoting to motoring and yachting clients. So he set about engineering a game-changing ‘smart surface’ product. In 2001, he made his first car product – C1 Crystal Lacquer – and marketed it through his brand ‘Gloss Techniq’ (later Gtechniq). Other innovations soon followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earle knew Gill (who is no longer involved) from the days they used to cycle together in Monaco and the south of France, where Earle was working with an Italian business. Eager to run his own project, Earle bought the European rights to Gtechniq in 2006 and was soon expanding the business worldwide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The brand set up camp in Northamptonshire in 2010 and it now markets 60 individual products, sells 1.2 million products a year and takes in £20 million in sales. It is hugely respected by owners of luxury cars such as Ferrari and Porsche. ‘There was nobody really doing ceramic technology for car care,’ says Earle. ‘From that point, it was really just about getting people to try it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike vision</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Gtechniq made its move into cycling in October 2021, and Earle’s own cycling background was a big inspiration. ‘In France, I rode an Olmo bike – an Italian bike brand, based near Genoa, which was a custom frame,’ he recalls. ‘So I knew cyclists were interested in quality products. We used to stop at</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a shop on the border with Italy and look at new Campagnolo stuff and riders were always talking about shaving a gram here or there.

But how does this potion really work? The secret, says Kennedy, is ‘surface energy’. This is a measure of how attracted a material’s molecules are to each other, and to other materials’ molecules. Or more simply: how ‘sticky’ a surface is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The higher the surface energy, the more things stick to it, be that water, grease or dirt,’ says Kennedy. ‘The lower the surface energy, the less things stick to it. The obvious example is a non-stick frying pan, which is easy to clean. Our ceramic serves a similar function: to reduce the surface energy on your frame, so dirt and oil find it harder to stick to it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gtechniq’s Bike Ceramic is made of silicones, or more specifically siloxanes – a group of compounds characterised by a chain of silicon and oxygen atoms. ‘A common example is silicone sealant for your bathroom, which gives you a rubbery, water-resistant film,’ says Kennedy. But different siloxanes have different side chains that can do different things. With the Bike Ceramic, they form chemical covalent bonds with the lacquer on your frame or wheels. ‘These side chains bond with the paint surface to form a film across the top,’ says Kennedy. ‘Previous technologies just sat on top of the paint, but we use composite technology as well that really “keys” into the paint to form different layers.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application is simple: you rub it on, leave it to react for around a minute, and then buff the product off.  ‘The layer left behind is about one micron thick, whereas human hair is about 70 microns,’ says Kennedy.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/gtechniq-advertorial-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Despite being near-indistinguishable, it forms a tough surface and reduces that crucial ‘surface free energy’, so there’s less for dirt to grab onto. That means a quicker, easier post-ride wash, and a shinier, newer-looking bike. ‘Most cyclists just want to do a quick hose down after a ride, so your bike looks great for your next ride,’ Kennedy says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lab life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gtechniq is constantly working to refine formulations and devise new products. Its in-house tests see plates coated with the same paint used on modern bikes sprayed with the latest formulation. The surface is then examined with a tensiometer – a machine that measures the surface energy of liquids or surfaces. A computer measures the contact angles of liquid blobs to gauge the hydrophobic quality of the surface: a taller, thinner blob will easily roll or wash off; a squat, fat blob will stick to the frame, dry and deposit gunk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the testing process, coated surfaces are drenched in simulated road grime. This is then rinsed off, and the surface beading is checked again under the tensiometer. The lab also features an inclinometer to measure the precise roll-off angle of water beads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To test the durability of a product, Gtechniq uses a UV-accelerated weathering machine, which deploys a bulb emitting harsh UV light to simulate the equivalent of two years’ worth of UV weathering in two weeks. A salt spray machine can simulate road conditions typical in the winter, and an abrasion scrub tester simulates years of frantic scrubbing. Earle calls these heavy-duty testing protocols ‘the sausage factory’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand ploughs the same energy into its wider range of products. Its Bike Clean spray uses specific surfactants to target oil and grit, and includes citrus oils, a powerful natural degreaser. The Drivetrain Degreaser has a more potent formula but doesn’t degrade components. Tri-Clean removes stains, odours and 99.9% of bacteria from helmets and shoes. Finally, Ceramic Quick Coat uses nanotechnology to offer a lower-cost (£19.50) water-based protection system that can last up to six months.

In the lab, Kennedy is looking at new formulations and applications, while upstairs in the company’s ‘Bike Room’, where snazzy bikes sit alongside vintage motoring and bike posters, Foster is hard at work on brand partnerships, team sponsorships, shop visits and high-profile trials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We gave it to Chris Froome, who came back with wonderful reviews,’ he says. ‘And we have big brands asking us about applying this from the factory stage.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earle hopes that in the next five years Gtechniq can slash their rivals’ dominance of the market in half. ‘The bike side is really starting to move,’ he says. ‘We have premium products and we have the technology to stand out in the market.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having become a hallmark name in the motoring and marine industries over the last 20 years, Gtechniq wants to bring the same level of quality to cyclists. But despite the complex science and the grand ambitions, the brand’s goal remains defiantly simple: ‘We know what cyclists want,’ says Kennedy. ‘Less time cleaning, more time riding.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• To find out more, visit <a href=\"https://www.gtechniq.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Gtechniq.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gtechniq-clean-cut\">Gtechniq: Clean cut</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"96a0118f8a519962293e817571ec5a9b9bfd38fc2ef37bcb708fb0632e4643bf","category":"Cycling"}
