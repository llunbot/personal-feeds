If they tell you\nif you buy another Ford car — they’ll give you $10,000 not to do\nthat — you’ll take the $10,000 and you’ll buy a Chevy instead.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Buffett, famously, isn’t technically minded. But I think that helps him understand Apple’s value. He’s right: Apple’s moat is customer loyalty, and that loyalty is earned through user experiences that other companies <em>can’t</em> match.</p>\n\n<p>Using Ford and Chevy as his counterexamples is serendipitous, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1647997065589592064\">as Dare Obasanjo quipped</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Someone should print this tweet out, frame it and give it to the\nCEO of GM in commemoration of their decision to stop supporting\nCarPlay in their vehicles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s true. The <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/04/general-motors-hates-your-iphone/\">anger over GM’s decision to drop CarPlay</a> and Android Auto support in its EVs is really only anger about dropping CarPlay.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/19/buffett-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a1ec2d14ff8fd1e2269cd0b7a307c21ff39945506ef7b65b554e24349ef7c093","category":"Tech"}
