But the new Paniagua wheels cut the price by a third without giving up much of their tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paniagua is a 42mm deep aero road wheelset with a 21mm internal width designed around 28-30mm tires. The key difference from the higher end Parcour Ronde wheels is the layup and carbon, and the symmetrical rims used front and rear.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1.jpg\" alt=\"parcours paniagua budget carbon aero road bike wheels on a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Parcours’ signature feature is their use of different front and rear rim profiles to optimize aerodynamics based on what the air is actually doing on each end of the bike. Check <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-083-parcours-on-aerodynamics-of-wide-rims-gravel-tires-more/\">our podcast interview with founder Dov Tate</a> to get into the weeds on their design and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ronde wheelset uses a 35/39mm deep combo, with varying rim profiles with a wider 22.5mm interior. The Paniagua sticks with a 42.1mm deep rim using the same shape front and rear and comes in at 1600g for the set (745g front, 855g rear), about 200g heavier than the Ronde (but also a bit deeper).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup detail of parcours paniagua budget carbon aero road bike wheels on a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight difference comes mainly from the T700 carbon and use of bladed Pillar 1423 spokes versus Sapim CX Ray. Bearings are EXO Stainless Steel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1306\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2.jpg\" alt=\"parcours paniagua budget carbon aero road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2-297x194.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2-800x522.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2-120x78.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2-768x502.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parcour-paniagua-entry-level-carbon-aero-road-wheels-2-1536x1003.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rated for road or gravel, MSRP is $999 (£759/€989).
