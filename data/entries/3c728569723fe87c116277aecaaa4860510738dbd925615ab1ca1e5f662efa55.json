But if you have accessory mounts on the side of your fork legs (or not), you may be wondering what to use to put those mounts in use. Well, something like the Ortlieb Fork Pack would do the trick.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review non drive side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-non-drive-side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / R.

I don’t have any bikepacking trips planned, as it’s getting really cold where I live. So, I will mostly be packing them up for some #coffeeoutside adventures, as well as packing some mid-ride lunch/snacks and packing along some layers. I will have more pics of that craziness later, in the full review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get to my first impressions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 4.1L Ortlieb Fork Pack</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review what it came with\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-what-it-came-with-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>What’s included with the Ortlieb Fork Pack</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ortlieb Fork pack comes in two sizes, the 5.8L and the 4.1L (tested). They also come in two colors, Black Matte, and Dark Sand (tested). The 4.1-liter packs are super lightweight at 290g (315g for the 5.8L) <em>with</em> the adaptor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review attaching point\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-attaching-point-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With Ortlieb’s Quick-Lock S (QLS) adapter, they can be taken on or off your bike in seconds. They mount like a small pannier but without the need for a front rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that they provide 8.2 liters (combined) of 100% waterproof storage on the bike. They can be mounted on any fork with accessory mounts on the legs with the supplied adaptor as long as the legs are untapered and between 30 and 42mm. The Fork pack can also be mounted to any tube within those diameters using the included adapter for round tubes without integrated mounts. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review pack open\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-open-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They use the tried and trued roll-top closure and are constructed using PVC-free nylon fabric that is sustainably produced in Germany. With the included QLS adapter, you can flip a lever and attach and detach the Fork Pack in seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fork Pack has two large front and rear reflective triangles and a reflective logo on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fork Pack Retail and Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $65 (single 4.1L), $75 (single 5.8L)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colors: Black Matt and Dark Sand </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Height: 28cm (11″)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Depth: 11cm (4.3″)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Max Load: 3kg (6.6lbs)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Material: PS21R, PS33</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adapter: Quick-Lock S</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 290g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Width: 17.5cm (6.9″)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Volume: 4.1L </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fork Pack Installation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The installation of the Fork Pack using the fork mounts went easy and without issue.

They provide a “buffer” between the fork and the QLS adapter when securing it to the fork. To use the Carbon Fiber Protective Inserts, just insert them in the designated spots behind the adapter, hold them to the fork, and install the included screws.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review adapter pre-mounted to pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adapter-pre-mounted-to-pack-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review locked in\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-locked-in-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review adpter on fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-adpter-on-fork-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review pack on the fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-pack-on-the-fork-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the adapters are installed, just slide the two bottom tongues into the bottom slots until you hear a “click”.  And there you have it, the packs are installed. To remove the Packs, simply press on the lever and pull down. Boom, it’s that easy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First impressions indicate that this pack system is easy to install and is high quality. The packs themselves are sturdy and well-built like we’ve come to expect from Ortlieb. I think the size choices are good for something that attaches to the fork of a bicycle. That being said, I don’t think I would like the 5.8-liter size. The 4.1-liter size seems the perfect size for my usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review front shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-front-shot-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden them loaded and empty on a handful of rides, I like how small-ish they are. They are light and so easy to take on and off of the Renegade. They are surprisingly quiet, even on the rough stuff. Very impressed so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price is spot-on for a fully waterproof, high-quality bag that happens to come with a very clever mounting adapter. There is a very good chance that these Packs will last a very long time, and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a fork pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Fork Pack First look Review from the rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ortlieb-Fork-Pack-First-look-Review-from-the-rider-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Layers (a flannel) on the left. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be back here with my final review in the next few months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out all of the neat stuff Ortlieb is doing by hitting the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ortlieb.com/usa_en/\" target=\"_blank\">Ortlieb.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-ortlieb-fork-pack/\">First Look: Ortlieb Fork Pack Offers 4.1 or 5.8 Liters of Easy On/Off Packability</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3c728569723fe87c116277aecaaa4860510738dbd925615ab1ca1e5f662efa55","category":"Cycling"}
