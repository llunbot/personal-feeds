That’s a lot of battery power but still below the carry-on limitations of major airlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note, though, that simultaneous output is limited to 100W, so if wirelessly charging your iPhone, AirPods and Watch at the same time, laptop charging will be pegged back to under 80W. That’s easily enough to keep even a 16-inch MacBook going when not being pushed too far in application use, and plenty for a 13- or 15-inch MacBook Air or 14-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A maximum of four charging points can be accessed simultaneously: for example, either the 30W via the cable or central USB-C port, plus iPhone, AirPods and Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other charging options include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>65W cable + 30W USB-C port</li>\n\n\n\n<li>(65W cable or USB-C port) + 15W wireless iPhone</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30W cable + 30W USB-C + 15 wireless iPhone</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Alogic Roam 21K 6 in 1 Power Bank open\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-open.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Simon Jary / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roam is quite chunky but not ridiculous for a power bank that’s handy enough for laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It measures 6.2 inches long by 3.2 inches wide and 1.4 inches deep (15.8 x 8.2 x 3.5cm), weighing 21.4oz (606g). That’s a little longer and wider than an iPhone 16 Pro. In terms of depth, it’s about the same height as three iPhones placed on top of each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along one side is a neatly tucked built-in 5-inch USB-C cable (12cm), which is useful if you don’t have a spare cable on your person when traveling. This cable connection can charge at 100W (PD 3.0), and can also be used to charge the battery pack itself at 65W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three USB-C ports at one end: two capable of charging at 100W and one at 18W. Either can be used to charge the power bank at 65W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wireless charging pad for iPhone is adjustable and pulls up from its folded-down prone position, revealing beneath the 5W Qi (non-magnetic) wireless charging pad for AirPods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the port end, another flap pulls up to give access to the Apple Watch charger. Any Watch owner will tell you that its rather pathetic battery is always calling out for a charge, and we are usually away from a charging cable and wall socket when the Low Power Option alert pops up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rated at only 2W, this isn’t powerful enough to fast-charge the Watch, but it will eventually fill up the Apple wearable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The looks of the Roam are smart utilitarian when folded down for travel, with one niggle that the black charging parts are prone to smudges and fingerprints.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Alogic Roam 21K 6 in 1 Power Bank overhead\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alogic-Roam-21K-6-in-1-Power-Bank-overhead.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Simon Jary / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In our tests the Alogic Roam charged our lab M2 Pro MacBook Pro to 91%, so nearly a full laptop charge. That’s about the norm for 20K or 21K laptop power banks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When testing Roam on an iPhone 16 Pro, we got one full charge (100%) plus another boost to 83%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a travel charger and power bank, that’s enough power to keep a MacBook commuter going through a mid-haul flight, with some juice for the AirPods and Watch, too.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img

just a power bank, but as Roam combines a travel-friendly battery pack with a sturdy desktop of bedside stand, it is decently priced if you are travelling often with your MacBook and other Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roam is a better deal than the company’s first multi-device, foldable power bank, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2219687/alogic-matrix-ultimate-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Matrix Ultimate</a> as it has four times the battery capacity, plus more ports and the integrated cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The $129.99 <a

it doesn’t host a power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A closer match is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2216927/oneadaptr-onego-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">OneAdaptr OneGo</a>, which folds up into a smaller package and includes a power bank, albeit at 10K one of half the size of the Roam.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img
