Leading our latest roundup of the best tech deals we can find is the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Store's annual holiday sale</a>, which kicked off earlier this week and runs until January 6.</p>\n<p>Though sales at PC gaming storefronts are fairly common, this one is notable for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/05/epics-mega-sale-returns-with-tons-of-discounts-on-notable-pc-games/\" target=\"_blank\">bringing back</a> a recurring coupon promo that takes $10 off any eligible game priced at $14.99 or more on Epic's store. You have to <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/coupons/holiday-sale\" target=\"_blank\">claim it first</a>, but the $10 coupon applies <em>on top</em> <em>of</em> any existing discounts—e.g., a game already on sale for $15 will only cost $5—and automatically renews after each transaction you complete.</p>\n<p>Also of note: Epic finally <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/introducing-the-epic-games-store-shopping-cart\" target=\"_blank\">added a shopping cart</a> to its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/epic-games-store-launches-with-extremely-limited-selection-of-games/\" target=\"_blank\">three-year-old storefront</a> earlier this month, so you can now check out with multiple games at once. If you do, the $10 coupon will apply to each eligible game in your cart <em>individually</em>, not as a one-time discount. If you pick up five games priced at $15 or more, for instance, you'll get $50 shaved off the total cost.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821507#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821507&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f6ce07928b6ea996d3175639065902914a9b08d64849d127a1d03bb2912b631","category":"Tech"}
