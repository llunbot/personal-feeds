This enhancement helps you reach a broader global audience and improves accessibility across various industries, including contact centers, broadcasting, and e-learning. The expanded language support allows for more efficient content moderation, improved agent productivity, and automatic subtitling for live events and meetings.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Lambda console <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-lambda-console-key-function-insights-amazon-cloudwatch-dashboard/\">now surfaces key function insights</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/aws-lambda-console-real-time-analytics-amazon-cloudwatch/\">supports real-time log analytics</a></strong> – The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> console now features a built-in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> Metrics Insights dashboard and supports CloudWatch Logs Live Tail, providing instant visibility into critical function metrics and real-time log streaming. You can now identify and troubleshoot errors or performance issues for your Lambda functions without leaving the console, as well as view and analyze logs in real time as they become available. You can reduce context switching and accelerate the development and troubleshooting processes for serverless applications. Check out the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/simplifying-lambda-function-development-using-cloudwatch-logs-live-tail-and-metrics-insights/\">launch post</a> for more details.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-bedrock-model-evaluation-custom-import-models/\">now supports evaluating custom model import models</a></strong> – You can now evaluate custom models you’ve imported to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/evaluation.html\">model evaluation</a> feature. This helps you to complete the full cycle of selecting, customizing, and evaluating models before deploying them. To evaluate an imported model, select the custom model from the list of models to evaluate in the model selector tool when creating an evaluation job.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-q-aws-supply-chain/\">Amazon Q in AWS Supply Chain</a></strong> – You can now use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/\">Amazon Q</a>, an interactive AI assistant, to analyze your supply chain data in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aws-supply-chain/\">AWS Supply Chain</a> and get insights to operate your supply chain more efficiently. Amazon Q can answer your supply chain questions by diving into your data. This reduces the time spent searching for information and streamlines finding answers to improve your supply chain operations.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><strong><u>Other AWS news<br /> </u></strong>Here are some additional news items and posts that you might find interesting:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AmazonOpenSearchService\"><strong>New Amazon OpenSearch Service YouTube channel</strong></a> – The channel offers bite-sized tutorials, curated content, and organized playlists on topics such as log analytics, semantic search, vector databases, and operational best practices.

It also demonstrates how to scale (both pod and cluster) by monitoring for custom metrics through Prometheus, and how you can load balance using an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html\">Application Load Balancer</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/instant-well-architected-cdk-resources-with-solutions-constructs-factories/\"><strong>Instant Well-Architected CDK Resources with Solutions Constructs Factories</strong></a> – You can now create well-architected AWS resources such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> buckets and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/\">AWS Step Functions</a> state machines with a single function call using the new <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-constructs-factories.html\">AWS Solutions Constructs Factories</a>. These factories handle all the best practices configuration for you while still allowing customization. Try using a Constructs factory the next time you need to deploy one of the supported resources.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Upcoming AWS events</u></strong><br /> Check your calendars and sign up for these AWS events:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/18/genai_lofts.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/18/genai_lofts.png\" alt=\"AWS GenAI Lofts\" width=\"200\" height=\"130\" /></a>AWS GenAI Lofts</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/startups/lp/aws-gen-ai-lofts\">AWS GenAI Lofts</a> are about more than just the tech, they bring together startups, developers, investors, and industry experts.
