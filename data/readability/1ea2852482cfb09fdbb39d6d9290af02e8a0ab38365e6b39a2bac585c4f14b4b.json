Credit: Blair Kemp.</p></div><p>When preparing a suspension fork for off-road riding, especially enduro or downhill mountain biking, the huge variability of the track must be taken into great consideration. It must be able to guarantee the rider a certain degree of handling. At BRIGHT, for example, we study in great detail the aspect of Sag management in order to create sensitive stresses even with a reduced static sag. This means that the rider is able to interpret the terrain and the trajectories with greater scope for improvisation, as they have a very reactive suspension fork at their disposal.</p><p>For off-road riding, precisely because of the variability of the track, the compromises to be made are very important to ensure great performance.</p><p><strong>NSR Racing: </strong>Generally speaking, in theory, they are similar – weight the outside pedal/footpeg, apply counter-steer pressure to the inside hand grip, rotate the hips and position the head and torso low forwards, and towards the exit of the corner. In practice, because of the vast differences between the two sports you are not going to confuse the two positions with each other – vehicle weights, speeds, terrain, and corner radius will all combine to make sure you do not mistake your DH bike for your MotoGP bike.</p><p><strong>THOK: </strong>The cornering technique is very different when talking Mountain Biking and MotoGP. The former is of course mostly performed off-road while the latter is a pure on-road on-asphalt activity. When cornering with a motorbike on a MotoGP or with a Bike on a MTB track you can use various techniques.</p><div id=\"attachment_279921\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-279921\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr.jpg\" alt=\"ducati corse thok emtb designer livio suppo comments on cornering technique\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03085604/New-Ducati-by-THOK-TK01-rr-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-279921\">THOK’s Ducati Corse eMTB, designed with consultation from Livio Suppo, former MotoGP Team Manager</p></div><p>With the Mountain Bike you can corner using a banking or you can slide the bike on the gravel; in MotoGP you need to be super precise, you cannot ride banking against something.

It is thanks to his large knowledge in the motorbike sector that the Ducati e-mtb (powered by THOK) project was born in 2019. As a matter of fact, Livio was -and still is – one of the most influential persons of the MotoGP scenario. A former Marketing Manager of Ducati Corse, from 2003 to 2009 he served as MotoGP Project Manager for the Italian motorcycle manufacturer. In 2010 he joined Honda Racing and became the first European to hold the position of Team Principal of the official HRC Repsol Honda Team. In MotoGP he has been the man behind 6 World Titles: 2 won with Casey Stoner (with Ducati in 2007 and with Honda in 2011) and 4 with Marc Marquez, with the Honda team (2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017).</p></div><p><strong>Ohlins: </strong>Two completely different styles of riding. A MotoGP rider is hard on the brakes before a corner, steer in, open throttle power slide or accelerate out of the corners. For MTB, since you don’t have the power from the engine it’s important to maintain speed through the whole corner which is tricky, not too fast or too slow going in because it’s your speed going into the corners that will decide the speed out of the corner.</p><p><strong>In MotoGP, some of the riders counter-intuitively steer away from the direction they want to travel in. Does this ever happen when cornering a mountain bike, or even a regular road bike, at high speed?</strong></p><p><strong>NSR Racing: </strong>Counter steering is a product of steering geometry and is used to help initiate the lean of the bike into a turn. Since both motorcycles and bicycles use the same basic concept of steering geometry this technique exists on all motorcycles and bicycles.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering.jpg\" alt=\"pole voima emtb cornering\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25135729/pole-voima-emtb-cornering-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>The key difference is due to the weight difference between a 16 kg DH bike vs a 157kg MotoGP bike – the required amount of counter steer on a bicycle is barely noticeable because of the relative weight advantage the rider has over the bike, whereas the MotoGP bike has more mass in general, but also a huge amount more rotating mass (wheels, crankshaft etc.) which is rotating much faster. Therefore, the required counter steer input required to help initiate lean is more noticeable &amp; deliberate.</p><p><strong>THOK: </strong>If I understood correctly the question, I would say that yes, that’s true for the MotoGP but this is not a conscious movement that the rider is doing. It’s unconscious. So I would say it could be something typical of any rider on two wheels, either on a motorcycle and yes, on an MTB too.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Thok-MIG-ltd-side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Thok-MIG-ltd-side.jpg\" alt=\"Thok MIG E-MTB, side\" width=\"600\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Thok-MIG-ltd-side.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Thok-MIG-ltd-side-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Thok-MIG-ltd-side-297x174.jpg 297w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></p><p><strong>Ohlins: </strong>No, in MotoGP they are sliding their bikes as a part of their cornering and therefore need to steer away.</p><p><em>Got a question of your own?
