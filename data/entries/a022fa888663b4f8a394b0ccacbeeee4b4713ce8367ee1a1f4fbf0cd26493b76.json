With a week and a half of racing to go, the UAE Team Emirates XRG rider looks likely to lead the Giro until the next appointment with the mountains on Stage 15 to Asiago on Sunday at the very least. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the bookies are starting to believe in the Mexican’s chances of going all the way, now placing him as the second favourite to win the Trofeo Senza Fine in Rome. His odds have narrowed from roughly 40-1 at the start of the Giro to 2-1 following Stage 11, according to betting comparison site <a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/cycling/giro-ditalia/winner/bet-history/isaac-del-toro\" target=\"_blank\">Oddschecker</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Del Toro does go on to win the Giro, he’ll be the first Mexican to win a Grand Tour and the youngest Giro winner since 1940. In the era of riders thriving in their early 20s such as Tadej Pogačar and Remco Evenepoel, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-next-pogacar\">could Del Toro become the latest wonderkid</a> to add his name to the Grand Tour record books?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>He’s got the climbing legs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215755972-970x647.webp\" alt=\"SIENA, ITALY - MAY 18: (L-R) Stage winner Wout Van Aert of Belgium and Team Visma | Lease a Bike and Isaac Del Toro of Mexico and Team UAE Team Emirates - XRG compete in the breakaway passing through a gravel strokes sector during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 9 a 181km stage from Gubbio to Siena / #UCIWT / on May 18, 2025 in Siena, Italy.

Stage 15 throws in the Monte Grappa, while Stage 16 will supply a rare chance to create gaps on the summit finish to San Valentino before the gravelled slopes of the Colle delle Finestre round out the expected GC action at the end of the final week. These stages will be pivotal in organising the final make-up of the GC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already in this Giro <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">we’ve seen Del Toro shine on the inclines</a>. He claimed the runners-up spot on Stage 7’s summit finish to Tagliacozzo, only missing out on the top spot by his teammate Ayuso. On Stage 11’s rolling finale, Del Toro was at the head of affairs once again, finishing in second place, securing another bag of bonus seconds with it. During this first half of the Giro, the only riders to have gained time on Del Toro in the mountains are Ayuso (Stage 7) and Richard Carapaz (Stage 11).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clear that Del Toro is a natural climber. He’s finished inside the top ten of some prime WorldTour summits in the past, including the Lagos de Covadonga, Monte Petrano and Willunga Hill. Looking at his stage racing record, the Mexican has a solid pedigree in WorldTour races, cracking the top ten at Tirreno-Adriatico and Itzulia Basque Country. His <em>palmarès</em> is, however, peppered with domestique efforts, usually on behalf of main team leader Pogačar and current Giro buddy Ayuso.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Del Toro has only beaten Primož Roglič once on an uphill finish outside the Giro d’Italia. Looking deeper, he’s rarely defeated the likes of Carapaz and Egan Bernal in a non-Giro setting. That may indicate that Del Toro could be found out once the real mountains come thick and fast as the race crosses into the Alps next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'join us and discover the world's best places to ride, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The team to beat</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215627030-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Pink Jersey UAE Team Emirates XRG's Mexican rider Isaac Del Toro poses with teammate UAE Team Emirates XRG's Spanish rider Juan Ayuso before the 11th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race of 186kms from Viareggio to Castelnovo ne' Monti on May 21, 2025.

Backed up by one of the strongest squads on the start list, the race has played into their hands. They currently have four riders inside the overall top ten, with two real options for leadership. It goes without saying but only one of their riders can be crowned in Rome on 1st June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have been eager to scrutinise the shared leadership roles of Ayuso and Del Toro, and whether that could be their downfall. Ayuso, who was the designated leader when the race started in Albania, has already addressed this, saying that the overall victory is the team’s objective, regardless of the rider. Del Toro also squashed rumours of a potential rift in the team after Stage 9, underlining that there’s no tension between the two youngsters. ‘We’re friends,’ he quipped back to Italian TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have even made connections to Jumbo-Visma’s fascinating 2023 Vuelta, in which the squad worked for underdog Sepp Kuss while filling out the top three places in the GC standings. Could UAE Team Emirates grant Del Toro the same honour?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s cliché, but the road <em>will</em> decide. UAE have enough team strength to work for both, without having to sacrifice Ayuso or Del Toro on behalf of the other before a significant time gap between the two is established. With that, Del Toro and Ayuso should remain the team’s two protected riders until the final week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how it pans out, it’s hard to see how UAE Team Emirates mess this up. Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe are on the back foot, with Roglič over a minute back from the pair. The Slovenian looks isolated, with just Guilio Pelizzari seeming fit enough to support him in the mountains. In comparison, UAE’s roster, which includes Rafał Majka, Brandon McNulty and Adam Yates, will most likely be in total control of the final week. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, at last year’s Vuelta a España – the only Grand Tour he has taken part in – he thrived in the final stages. He had the energy to jump into the breakaway through the final week, reaching the top ten on Stage 16’s tough finish to Lagos de Covadonga. Likewise, he was inside the top 20 to Picón Blanco on Stage 20 before posting one of his best time-trial results in the final day’s TT around Madrid, finishing in 13th place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of those results came through breakaway efforts, so it’s unknown just how well he’ll fare when he’s placed into the final week as a GC favourite. He might crack as the effects of three weeks of fatigue slowly creep in – maybe emphasised by his boyish excitement to defend the <em>maglia</em> <em>rosa</em> this week. Stages 16, 19 and 20 all have in excess of 4,000m of elevation gain. With so many heavy-hitting climbing days back-to-back, the inexperience of Del Toro in a three-week race may prove to be his own downfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back at the 2020 Giro d’Italia, during which João Almeida was in a similar position, the final week brought a swift conclusion to his long reign in the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia rosa</a></em>, falling from race leader to fourth during the final days. Another poor precedent, on only two occasions since 2020 has the race leader on the final rest day won the Giro d’Italia a week later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So, can he do it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1695\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-970x642.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-768x509.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-1536x1017.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-2048x1356.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-750x497.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-1140x755.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216292358-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point in the race, it’s evident that the 21-year-old is in it to win it. He’s been hunting bonus seconds, following attacks and giving all the post-race responses you’d expect from a Grand Tour leader. Now that the time-trials are done and dusted, he’ll be allowed a chance to see whether he can actually keep his gap in the mountains, given the two-pronged strategy at UAE Team Emirates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect they’ll try to keep both leaders at the front of affairs until Stage 16, when the race hits one of its most decisive stages yet. If Del Toro has a one-minute advantage over Ayuso by the end of that stage, he has a strong likelihood of winning this race. If his lead shrinks to less than 20 seconds after Stage 16, all hands need to be on deck for Ayuso.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayuso isn’t guaranteed to be in sparkling form by the final week either though. He’s only finished on the final podium of a Grand Tour once, and since then, there have been glimpses of some shaky consistency in stage races, particularly when there are heavy mountain stages placed close to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bearing all this in mind, I’ll go out there and say that a podium place is almost 80% guaranteed for Del Toro. I truly believe a GC victory could be on the cards here, but it all depends on how the team manages their leadership dynamic in the final week. It’s their race to lose, and by the sounds of it, Roglič is going to have to pull something monumental out of the bag to fight against UAE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A plucky <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-l-avenir-success\">former Tour de l’Avenir champion</a> with a chance to defeat the pre-race favourite, riding for UAE Team Emirates, when the team backed a different rider coming into the race.
