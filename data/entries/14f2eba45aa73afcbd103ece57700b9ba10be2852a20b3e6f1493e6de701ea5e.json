But what we do know, because Apple reports the revenue numbers, is that iPhone sales have been remarkably flat, year-over-year, for the last 13 quarters.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/floundering-reuters\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"14f2eba45aa73afcbd103ece57700b9ba10be2852a20b3e6f1493e6de701ea5e","category":"Tech"}
