Other than <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence compatibility</a>, which is arguably more important for the iPhone than the iPad anyway, the new iPad mini will have the same design, display, and features as the current model. And today, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B09G9BXKF5/\">that current model is on sale for $150 off at Amazon</a>, the same price it dropped to for Prime Day, and the lowest we’ve ever seen</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><p></p><p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon is selling all colors and capacities of the iPad mini for $150 off, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B09G95MFD1/\">including cellular models</a>. Our favorite, however, is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B09G9LPNLG/\">Wi-Fi-only iPad mini with 256GB of storage for $150</a>. Essentially you’ll be getting an extra 192GB of storage for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after three years, the current model is a fantastic small tablet, with a super-light design weighing just a half-pound. Built around an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, it’s got a speedy A15 processor, a 12MP ultra-wide front camera, and a Touch ID-enabled power button.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3a628d4e05451f8250932f63802c520e1ee73414239d924b0e9ed87102b1dd49","category":"Apple"}
