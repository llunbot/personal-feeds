Or maybe\nit’s a photo-sharing social network with a free iPhone client.</p>\n\n<p>The app is nice, but I can’t see why I’d use the sharing service\ninstead of Flickr.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Points to me for considering it noteworthy on launch day, but demerits for wrongly seeing it as a camera app with photo-sharing on the side. (I do still maintain <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber\">my Flickr account</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/12/df-archive-instagram\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"26f7c7911e3ccd11684c7d2433dd1dfd098c76c1b31ba9aaf21d30c6c4dcdb4b","category":"Tech"}
