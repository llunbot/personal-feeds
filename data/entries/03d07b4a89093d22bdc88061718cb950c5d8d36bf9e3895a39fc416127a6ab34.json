Almost by default, the Series 9 wins the title of the best general-purpose smartwatch Apple has ever made,” our review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smartwatch has a beautiful and bright screen and is super useful for keeping track of your fitness and health journeys. It can even monitor your heart by taking ECGs. It’s also ready for watchOS 11, which brings the new Vitals app and activity enhancements. And with cellular connectivity (which requires a separate monthly fee from your carrier) you can stay connected without an iPhone, send texts, and easily stream music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-9-With-Blood-Oxygen-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M/5031676480\" target=\"_blank\">save $150 on one of the 9th-generation Apple Watch</a> with both GPS and cellular.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save big on the Apple Watch Series 9</span><div><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-9-With-Blood-Oxygen-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M/5031676480\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Walmart</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"03d07b4a89093d22bdc88061718cb950c5d8d36bf9e3895a39fc416127a6ab34","category":"Apple"}
