It's March 12, and today's photo comes from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>\n<p>Astronomers have long been fascinated by a nebula, NGC 604, in the relatively nearby Triangulum Galaxy. That's because this nebula contains about 200 of the hottest and largest types of stars, most of which are in the early stages of their lives. Some of these stars are 100 times or more massive than the Sun. Astronomers know of no other region in the Universe so densely packed with large stars as this nebula.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009469#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009469&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fffb269d57e4ee2690733890980f286eaece275d01d9b60206be0c65337875dc","category":"Tech"}
