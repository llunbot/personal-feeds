Even in the winter, I’d see photos of riders in shorts slashing through the snow! Nowadays, riding pants have become commonplace and we have a lot of high-quality options to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got the chance to try out 7mesh’s updated Glidepath pants this year, and they proved to be a versatile pair. They remain comfortable through a vast temperature range, offer room for kneepads, and are non-restrictive as you pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the pants, I was able to test Arcade’s new A2 belt. The A2 is a stretchy belt with a slim, lightweight plastic buckle. The belt held my pants in place perfectly, but stretched enough to remain comfortable on the trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7mesh Glidepath Pants:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1641\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-front.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-front.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-front-219x300.jpg 219w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-front-88x120.jpg 88w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-front-768x1050.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-front-1123x1536.jpg 1123w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After covering the updated <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/7mesh-new-mtb-road-gravel-clothing-spring-2024/\">Glidepath pants</a> </strong>earlier this year, I’ve been riding them since Spring. Initially, I got to ride them in cooler weather and really enjoyed wearing them on chilly Spring days. The Glidepaths are a thin, lightweight warm weather pant, but they still hold heat in more than shorts so I’d ride them in anything down to near-freezing temperatures. A little mud and splash resistance is also nice for your legs on those cooler days.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, SF climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-climbing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since they are intended for warm weather riding, I tested the Glidepaths in summer temperatures too. I can’t say they’re as cool as shorts, but they are the coolest pair of pants I’ve ridden in yet. I’ve done a few three-hour rides in temperatures from the mid-teens to the low 20’s (Celsius) and remained perfectly comfortable. I’m sure they would be quite tolerable up to higher temperatures, so the Glidepaths would be a good choice for racers who are required to cover up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-on-bike-side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-on-bike-side.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, on bike, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-on-bike-side.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-on-bike-side-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-on-bike-side-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-on-bike-side-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-on-bike-side-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These pants have no vents so they rely on their thin fabric to keep you from overheating. Some venting could be a nice addition for really hot rides, but the Glidepaths do stay comfortable in a wide temperature range without them. At no point during my summer rides did I ever stop and think “My legs are too hot!”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, SF, rocky chute\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-SF-rocky-chute-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Glidepaths have a relaxed fit to help ensure free motion, and they did fantastic in this regard. There is no restriction whatsoever to leg motion with the Glidepaths, and they don’t fit tight around the waist area either. The lower legs do taper down, and they never once got caught in my chain. The bottom hems are snug enough that they pop over my heels when I pull the pants on, but a small stretch panel makes that easy to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-w-kneepads.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-w-kneepads.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, with kneepads\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-w-kneepads.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-w-kneepads-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-w-kneepads-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-w-kneepads-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-w-kneepads-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing 7mesh nailed with the Glidepaths was leaving generous room for kneepads. I was able to wear my POC Oseus VPD knees under these pants without them feeling crammed inside, and with no annoying hang-ups as I rode. Opting for a good level of knee protection is possible with these pants.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-waist-adjuster.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-waist-adjuster.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, waist adjusters\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-waist-adjuster.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-waist-adjuster-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-waist-adjuster-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-waist-adjuster-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh gave the Glidepaths a great set of waist adjusters. The clips are small and lightweight, but they are easy to use and they don’t slip. If somehow these adjusters don’t work for you, the Glidepath pants do include belt loops. I didn’t need to, but I used the loops to test out Arcade’s new A2 belt… more on that below. The Glidepaths’ two-button waist closure ensures a secure fit, and I like the traditional zippered fly.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for fit, I am 5’10” and the medium Glidepaths fit me very well. The waist easily cinched down enough for my slightly under 32” waist, and the legs are long enough that they look a bit bunchy near the bottoms, but that ensures full ankle coverage in any riding position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-wet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-wet.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, wet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-wet.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-wet-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-wet-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-wet-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that didn’t impress me about the Glidepaths was their level of water resistance. On an early misty ride, water was beading up on the DWR-coated pants nicely but in direct rain, they didn’t last long before getting soaked. I should note that the Glidepaths are not advertised as a waterproof pant, but I had to see how they fended off rain anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light rain, it only took about 20 minutes for water to start soaking through the tops of my knees. Areas of the pants that didn’t get directly hit by rain stayed dry, so they do protect from puddle splashes and light mud splatter. In any kind of actual rain, however, these pants will get saturated fairly quickly. I tried one ride in steady rain for 30-40 minutes and came home with my thighs soaked.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-pockets.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1469\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-pockets.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, pockets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-pockets.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-pockets-245x300.jpg 245w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-pockets-98x120.jpg 98w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7mesh-Glidepath-pants-pockets-768x940.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing I like about the Glidepaths is their pocket layout. You get a fair amount of storage between two hand pockets, which are quite deep, and two zippered side pockets. The zippered pockets will carry a phone or wallet without excessive bouncing or movement, they’re easy to access, and they keep items away from your saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t taken any nasty spills in the Glidepath pants, but mine aren’t showing any kind of damage or wear and tear—the Glidepath pants retail for $180. Men’s and women’s models are available in sizes XS-XXL. Men’s color options are Black, Midnight Blue, or Shale. Women’s color choices are Black or Shale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arcade A2 Belt:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock.jpg\" alt=\"Arcade A2 belt, on rock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-rock-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Conveniently, right after I agreed to test the Glidepath pants I got the offer to try <strong><a href=\"https://arcadebelts.com/?tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=&amp;tw_campaign=20921636792&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgClmnplOtSAZ832GL1ZAKA4hD3p8dqyocIMUjeUFqgxL8E6FK6EtaavxoCg-UQAvD_BwE\">Arcade</a></strong>’s new A2 belt. If you’re not familiar with Arcade they make stretchy belts with lightweight plastic buckles, ideal for active people like hikers and bikers. I’ll tell you now, I formerly would have said I’d never ride with a belt, but Arcade’s A2 belt was comfortable enough to forget about completely while riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arcade offers the A2 belts in a wide range of color and graphic options. The style I tried out is called the ‘Out of Range’, and it features an embroidered mountain landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle.jpg\" alt=\"Arcade A2 belt, buckle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-buckle-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The A2 belts feature a redesigned buckle that’s easier to slip through belt loops versus Arcade’s previous design. I have two of Arcade’s Ranger Slim belts with the old buckles, and they are prone to catching on belt loops. The new buckle is far easier to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail.jpg\" alt=\"Arcade A2 belt, tail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-tail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The A2 belt’s buckle is also slightly curved to sit flush against your body. Another nice feature is how the tail of the belt runs along the inside, and is held securely with an elasticized loop so there’s nothing left dangling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the trails, I quickly realized the A2 belt was indeed perfectly comfortable to ride with. There’s enough stretch in the fabric that you never feel any significant tightening, let alone that lock-up point around your waist that normal belts allow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist.jpg\" alt=\"Arcade A2 belt, on pants\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Arcade-A2-belt-on-waist-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard width A2 belt (1.5” wide) has a good amount of holding power, and can easily keep a lightweight pair of riding pants in place. I noticed it did better at holding up a heavier, looser-fitting pair of casual jeans I own. The slim belts I have (1.25” wide) struggled with these pants a bit, but the wider belt held them up just fine. The A2 belt is available in both widths, and if you’re buying one for riding shorts I’m sure the slim style would do the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On my first ride with the Glidepath pants, I actually forgot I was wearing the A2 belt. Through all my test rides the buckle always worked easily and reliably, I’ve had no problems with the belt stretching out, and without wearing it too tightly it keeps my pants perfectly in place at my waist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a pair of shorts or pants that have belt loops and fit a bit loose, or have waist adjusters you don’t like, Arcade’s A2 belt will keep them up with no discomfort or restriction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The A2 belts retail for $34.95 – $37.95. The Standard belt fits up to 40” waists, and some models are available in a Long model that fits up to 50”.  </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/7mesh-glidepath-pants-arcades-a2-belt-review/\">A Spring And Summer With 7mesh’s Glidepath Pants And Arcade’s A2 Belt</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f31114fb36763a3b312dbfd12fbc8b7ad05b278360bd2749b645e8a9412ef7bb","category":"Cycling"}
