As the only bike bag company headquartered in Austin, TX, they have filled the empty void of local cycling companies with a rainbow of cool bags.

His beard is extra puffy, and his plaid shirt looks a little too warm for Austin, Texas. Matt, a transplant of North Carolina, is the founder and sole designer for MoosePacks, a bike bag company. MoosePacks began in Boone, North Carolina, where Matt designed the first bag. These brightly-colored bags were tested by Matt, a recovering cat 1 racer, through the gnarly trails of Pisgah National Forest and along the smooth descents of the Blue Ridge Parkway. You wouldn’t guess it by his mountain man appearance, but Matt studied apparel design and merchandising at Appalachian State. He then went on to work as a pattern maker for America’s jean company, Wrangler. Matt credits his attention to detail to the skills he learned during his time working with top-level professionals at Wrangler. 2021 MoosePacks relocated to Austin, Texas. Matt’s wife Katherine Moosa, if a person can be described as a drink, is like a warm cup of coffee on a cold day. She radiates Southern warmth and charm. Katherine manages sales, social media, and expos. If you have the chance to meet her at a cycling event, I recommend that you do. This two-person team puts their heart and soul into these bags and this company.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Devil in the Details</h3>\n<p>Matt has spent hours prototyping and perfecting every detail of each of the bags. For example, the foam spacer on the top tube bags was custom designed for the bags and allows for additional stability, because no one likes a floppy top tube bag. If a repair is needed, you can send it back to them for an affordable mending. As a cheeky addition, the zippers on the handlebar bags double as a whistle.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Designed and tested in-house</li>\n<li>Made in the USA with high-quality materials</li>\n<li>Sustainable approach to the overall design of the products and the company</li>\n<li>Stellar customer service</li>\n<li>The bags just work!</li>\n<li>Limited but custom options available</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>MoosePacks Gives Back</h3>\n<p>MoosePacks has a mission that goes beyond just making bags. They provided support to the victims of the North Carolina hurricane relief. They support the adults with brain injuries by giving to the <a href=\"https://kingchallenge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">King Challenge</a> event. They support our National Parks by giving back to the <a href=\"https://brpfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation</a>. “If I am starting a company and it’s successful, I believe the right thing to do is give back,” Matt says. “We support more than what’s on paper. Many people took chances in helping us with our business and still do. If we can help someone else along the way, then we will do our best.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-14.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-15.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-17.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Expos/Adventure Rides</h3>\n<p>You can see first-hand the quality and functional designs of the bags in bike shops across the US or meet the couple behind the company at one of the nine <a href=\"https://www.moosepacks.com/pages/events\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bike events</a> this year.</p>\n<h3>Preaching the Gospel of the Top Tube</h3>\n<p>I used to think top tube bags were exclusively for triathletes or ultra nerds, but I have seen the light. My personal favorite bag is now their top tube bag, because it has liberated me from needing to wear a cringey jersey on short rides or having a lumpy jersey on long rides. I can ride around in a T-shirt while having a snack and my phone within reach. I’ve had my top tube MoosePacks for years and it’s still going strong. I occasionally wash the dirt off, but it has kept its color and shape nicely.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-13.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Moosepacks_Shop_Visit-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Why Buy a Moosepack?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The bags are beautiful and durable</li>\n<li>They are sustainably made in the USA</li>\n<li>Every detail has been intentionally designed by a shredder for shredding</li>\n<li>They give back to our community</li>\n<li>The folks behind the company genuinely care about their customers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/moosepacks-shop-visit/\">MoosePacks Shop Visit: Made in Austin</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f6a9d969a506a8edaf5b12fa300d5a8284bd9556038b0a847efedbca64f65256","category":"Cycling"}
