Just 50 sets of Intend TrinTi brakes will ever be made, going on sale at 3pm &amp; 4pm in Europe (9am &amp; 10am EST). DH first, then Enduro/Trail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will sell out fast, so if you’ve got more than a thousand euros to burn on some ultra-premium mountain bike brakes, you better set an alarm!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Today Only!

They’ve since gone on to be a 800-900€ brakeset that is so sought after, you have to subscribe to Intend’s newsletter to snack a set up when a new batch is made available a couple times a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now… “<em>Instead of discounts and mass production, Intend is introducing something rare and extraordinary.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Originals vs. Blackline</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This past spring, Intend announced a bit of a split in their product line-up – Originals vs. Blackline. Originals were those components that would still online be available consumer-direct from Intend. They feature the classic look and premium performance originally imagined by founder Cornelius Kapfinger – that is natural hard-anodized gold moving parts mixed with black ano fixed elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newer Blackline was developed as an all-black ano alternative that was more suitable to a bikeshop dealer distribution solution, while still offering Intend’s signature precision, attention to detail, and performance. Just “(usually) very black” because that was what customers kept asking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what’s new in the TriniTi brakes and how do they fit in?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Intend TriniTi ultra-limited edition black titanium Trinity mountain bike brakes, Today Only for Black Friday, lever on handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Intend-TriniTi-ultra-limited-edition-black-titanium-Trinity-mountain-bike-brakes_Today-Only-for-Black-Friday_lever-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, even though they are all black, technically these limited edition TriniTi brakes still fall under the ‘Originals’ designation. They are the absolute highest level of performance, and will only be sold direct.
