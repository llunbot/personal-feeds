In fact, it looks like it is cheaper than many conventional titanium bikes, while incorporating the sleek curved lines and smooth integration you most often see on the latest carbon bikes…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ribble Allroad Ti 3D-printed titanium road &amp; gravel bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

They described the benefit of the 3D-printed tech as allowing them to “create shapes with a high strength-to-weight ratio coping with more multi-directional loads, as well as allowing you to put material exactly where you want it to deal with specific stresses as opposed to taking material away” like you would with conventional CNC-machining of frame connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_angled-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1700\" height=\"1275\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_angled-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Ribble Allroad Ti 3D-printed titanium all-road fast-gravel bike, angled detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_angled-jpg.webp 1700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_angled-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_angled-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_angled-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_angled-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking advantage of some of the aero-shaping features of Ribble’s top carbon Ultra road bikes, the Allroad Ti adds in more relaxed endurance geometry long days on the bike, and bigger 35mm tire clearance for comfort over all road surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unique UB-2 adjustable aero carbon handlebar</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"All-new Ribble UB-2 shapely aero carbon drop bar road &amp; gravel handlebar, direct mount brake lever bodies\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ribble-UB-2-aerodynamic-carbon-road-and-gravel-handlebar_bar-with-direct-brake-lever-body-hood-mounting-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-spec Allroad Ti bikes also are the first to include the wild shapely new Ribble UB-2 carbon handlebar that debuted on the ti prototype last fall.

Things are all relative here. And the “Hero +” build that Ribble is using to show off this bike is still plenty out-of-reach expensive for most cyclists at £9800 / $11,580 / 13,375€ with its Dura-Ace Di2 &amp; upgraded carbon Zipp 353 NSW wheels at a claimed 8.7kg. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the good news is there are plenty of much more accessible options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_Sport-mechanical-105-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_Sport-mechanical-105-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Ribble Allroad Ti Sport, affordable 3D-printed titanium all-road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_Sport-mechanical-105-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_Sport-mechanical-105-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_Sport-mechanical-105-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_Sport-mechanical-105-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ribble-Allroad-Ti-3D-printed-titanium-all-road-fast-gravel-bike_Sport-mechanical-105-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>2024 Ribble Allroad Ti Sport</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, complete Ribble Allroad Ti builds start at just £3500 / $4135 / 4780€ with a mechanical Shimano 105 2×12 groupset and alloy wheels (9.9kg). 105 Di2 starts at just £4100 / $4845 / 5600€ (9.3kg).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are surely cheaper entry-level all-road bikes out there, you’ll be hard pressed to find more affordable complete ti bikes at that price. And certainly not cool, swoopy-looking 3D-printed ti bikes.
