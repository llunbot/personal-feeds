However, each year it gets bigger in the UK as retailers compete to out-do each other.</p>\n<p>What historically was, as the name suggests, a day-long sale now runs from early November.</p>\n<h2>Are the GoPro deals on Black Friday worth waiting for?</h2>\n<p>GoPro has tightened up its distribution in the last few years, so few retailers have the cameras, although there’s still a broader market in GoPro-compatible accessories.</p>\n<p>GoPro bundles up its cameras with a year’s subscription to its site, which gives you enhanced editing tools, unlimited cloud storage and damaged camera replacement. Take out the subscription deal to get the best price on GoPro cameras.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h3>How to get a good GoPro deal on Black Friday</h3>\n<p>Here are a few tips to help you pick out the perfect GoPro deal on Black Friday:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do your research. Don’t buy a product until you’ve read some online reviews</li>\n<li>Make sure you know what you intend to buy by putting together a wishlist. Of course, you might find inspiration during your online browsing, but with retailers clamouring for your attention, it’s also important to focus on seeking out specific products</li>\n<li>Don’t take a price drop at face value. Often, retailers list hugely inflated RRPs, while in reality the products haven’t been that expensive for months or even years</li>\n<li>If you see a product you want, add it to your shopping basket and check the prices on other sites before you head to the checkout. Also keep in mind that major stores such as John Lewis and Currys PC World guarantee to match prices with other sellers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<h3>Should I wait for Cyber Monday?</h3>\n<p>Cyber Monday always used to be an online-only sales event. But since so much more shopping is now taking place online, we expect the sale to play out differently again this year.</p>\n<p>We think there will be far less of a clear distinction between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year. Put simply, don’t stop browsing during that weekend, it could well be that’s when some new details surface online.</p>\n<p>And, if you see an awesome discount on the Friday, it’s perhaps not worth waiting until the Monday to see if the price drops again.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ada17b0fb3d91d78491320f7d27e6f805a70306cdd225b3b4a0fe353702494fd","category":"Cycling"}
