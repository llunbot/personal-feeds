{"title":"iOS 17.3 is out now with Stolen Device Protection and Collaborative Playlists","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2169796/ios-17-3-beta-features-release-stolen-device-protection.html","date":1705948443000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, Apple began beta testing iOS 17.3 the day after <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2164433/ios-17-2-features-little-improvements.html\">iOS 17.2</a> was released. This update will bring collaborative playlists to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2164226/apple-music-wont-get-collaborative-playlists-until-next-year.html\">Apple Music</a> (removed in a late beta of iOS 17.2) and enables <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2168672/airplay-in-hotel-rooms-officially-delayed-until-2024.html\">AirPlay in supporting hotels</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting update in IOS 17.3 is a previously unannounced feature called Stolen Device Protection. When enabled, the feature will make it harder to perform certain actions, including changing your Apple ID password, passcode, or viewing your other passwords, when away from a familiar place. With just your iPhone passcode (which could be obtained simply by watching a user enter it), a thief can change the Apple ID password and wipe your iPhone, but Stolen Device Protection adds the layer of Face ID or Touch ID when away from your home, work, or other trusted location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 01/22/24: </strong>The release candidate for iOS 17.3 is out now for developers, and should reach public testers shortly. The final release will likely come next week on the 23rd or 24th.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.3 Release Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s official release notes for iOS 17.3 are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>Stolen Device Protection</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stolen Device Protection increases security of iPhone and Apple ID by requiring Face ID or Touch ID with no passcode fallback to perform certain actions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security Delay requires Face ID or Touch ID, an hour wait, and then an additional successful biometric authentication before sensitive operations like changing device passcode or Apple ID password can be performed</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lock Screen</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Unity wallpaper honors Black history and culture in celebration of Black History Month</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborate on playlists allows you to invite friends to join your playlist and everyone can add, reorder, and remove songs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Emoji reactions can be added to any track in a collaborative playlist</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This update also includes the following improvements:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AirPlay hotel support lets you stream content directly to the TV in your room in select hotels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AppleCare &amp; Warranty in Settings shows your coverage for all devices signed in with your Apple ID</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crash detection optimizations (all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.
