But the reviewed data, discussion, and vote today were significantly different from the booster-authorization meetings for Pfizer/BioNTech and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/fda-advisors-unanimously-greenlight-moderna-boosters-for-people-65-high-risk/\">Moderna COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>\n<h2>Dose two</h2>\n<p>The J&amp;J vaccine has consistently lagged behind the two mRNA vaccines in efficacy against COVID-19. Some estimates have put the J&amp;J vaccine's effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization as low as 68 percent, while the two mRNA vaccines have seen estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization in the high 80s to low 90s. Recent data suggests that the mRNA vaccines' protection against infection may start waning six or more months after primary dosesâ€”particularly in older and more vulnerable people. This data prompted the push for boosters. But such waning does not appear to be happening with the J&amp;J vaccine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804634#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804634&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2a502863b90766df72f6cae9f1276d4c2926585ef64fdb538896be5c3092ea9e","category":"Tech"}
