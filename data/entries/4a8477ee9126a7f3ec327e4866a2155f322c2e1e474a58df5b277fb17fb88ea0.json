Officials also added eight fugitives linked to the enterprises to Europe’s Most Wanted list. The droppers named by Europol are IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, Smokeloader, Bumblebee, and Trickbot.</p>\n<p>Droppers provide two specialized functions. First, they use encryption, code-obfuscation, and similar techniques to cloak malicious code inside a packer or other form of container. These containers are then put into email attachments, malicious websites, or alongside legitimate software available through malicious web ads. Second, the malware droppers serve as specialized botnets that facilitate the installation of additional malware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027800#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027800&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a8477ee9126a7f3ec327e4866a2155f322c2e1e474a58df5b277fb17fb88ea0","category":"Tech"}
