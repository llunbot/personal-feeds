The photos had been uploaded by users to online platforms, then analyzed by scientists using a research approach known as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953472030077X\">iEcology</a>. Of the 386 photos, the vast majority, 326 cases, featured hermit crabs using plastic items as shelters.</p>\n<p>At first glance, this is a striking example of how human activities can alter the behavior of wild animals and potentially the ways that populations and ecosystems function as a result. But there are lots of factors at play and, while it’s easy to jump to conclusions, it’s important to consider exactly what might be driving this particular change.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000814#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000814&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"825f7bfeed67bb06cded5ab5fa43e7aaff67f3246900f113afc8555b5bb48df2","category":"Tech"}
