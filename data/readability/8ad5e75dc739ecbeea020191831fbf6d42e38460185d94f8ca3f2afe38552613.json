And all without sacrificing lateral rigidity or overall strength.

And because the rims cure faster, require much less post-cure finishing work, and get a powder coat finish rather than typical clear coat, they’re more environmentally friendly…from manufacturing process energy savings all the way through to being 100% recyclable.</p><h2>Chris King GRD23 Gravel Wheels</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1.jpg\" alt=\"chris king grd23 carbon fiber gravel bike wheels\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1185\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1-297x220.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1-800x593.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1-120x89.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1-768x569.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04104508/chris-king-grd23-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-1-1536x1138.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Chris King GRD23 gravel wheels are built on FusionFiber’s standard gravel/all-road rims, which measure 23mm internal, 29.5mm external, and 24mm deep. Fusion’s own claimed rim weight is 375g, but Chris King is listing it at 404g and adds that they participated in the development and were able to tune it to their performance specs. Also, they added decals. Either way, it’s a good starting point for pairing with King’s R45 Centerlock hubs.</p><p>They’re built with 24 Sapim CX Ray spokes front and rear on your choice of nine different hub colors and standard stainless or ceramic bearings. Claimed wheel weights are 664g front, 804g rear, and 1,468g for the set.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4cJN7DsC0k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>Base price is $2,650 with either Shimano 11/12-speed or SRAM XDR freehub bodies, add $100 for ceramic bearings. That’s only about 100g heavier than the ENVE rim build, but $350 less expensive. The Centerlock rotor lock ring is sold separately, but tubeless tape and valve stem are included. Shipping is expected to begin in February 2022.</p><h2>Chris King MTN30 Mountain Bike Wheels</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4.jpg\" alt=\"chris king mtn30 wheels with FusionFiber thermoplastic carbon rims\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1219\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4-297x226.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4-800x610.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4-120x91.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4-768x585.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04113422/chris-king-MTN30-carbon-fiber-mountain-bike-wheels-4-1536x1170.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The mountain bike wheels come in at $2,550 with your choice of Shimano Microspline, standard Shimano alloy freehub, or SRAM XD.
