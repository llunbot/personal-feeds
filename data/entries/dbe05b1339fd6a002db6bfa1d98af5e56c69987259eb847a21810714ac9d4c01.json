I’d seen them maybe once or twice before.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know for sure at that time if I was going to be racing Roubaix, so I was just thinking, ‘I really hope I get to race Roubaix now just so I can ride these pedals.’”</p>\n<p>The decades-old Speedplay pedals were gifted by Magnus to Zoe as something of a good luck token for her first full Women’s WorldTour season.</p>\n<p>The distinctive cross-shape components were stripped of all the plastic casing before Magnus’ winning ride in 2004 to prevent mud clogging the system and scuppering engagement with the cleats.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1480816115.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><figcaption><span>Zoe Bäckstedt rode her rookie Roubaix on pedals older than she is.</span> (Photo: Tim de Waele/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>And it turns out the pedals still contained a sprinkle of Roubaix magic Saturday because Zoe’s EF Education-TIBCO-SVB teammate Alison Jackson kicked to a beyond-belief breakaway victory.</p>\n<p>“I kept hearing in the radio [Jackson] had 10-15 seconds all for the last 5km, I was screaming into the radio,” Bäckstedt said shortly after she rolled to the line placed 46th.</p>\n<p>“When I came into the velodrome and I saw it on the big screen … I’m just so happy for her.”</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t all good vibes in the velodrome for the Bäckstedt family after the Femmes.</p>\n<p>Zoe’s sister Elynor saw her Trek-Segafredo team’s chances of a third-straight victory upturned when Lucinda Brand and Elisa Longo Borghini crashed, and Elynor finished 76th in the velodrome.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Canyon-SRAM, the team Magnus now directs from the team car, failed to hit the top 10.</p>\n<p>Maybe Elynor or Magnus should take the pedals for a ride next time the Bäckstedts venture on a family racing day out.</p>","author":"Jim Cotton","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"dbe05b1339fd6a002db6bfa1d98af5e56c69987259eb847a21810714ac9d4c01","category":"Cycling"}
