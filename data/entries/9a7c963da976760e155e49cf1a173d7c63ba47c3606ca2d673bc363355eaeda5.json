The code was dormant on iOS and macOS at that time, but in the backend files for ‌iOS 18‌, macOS 15, and ‌visionOS‌ 2, the code is active, suggesting an expansion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe possibility of topographic maps follows our report yesterday on another possible ‌Apple Maps‌ feature, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/\">support for custom routes</a>. With custom routes, users will presumably be able to create their own routes without being limited to Apple's pre-selected options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌‌iOS 18‌‌ will be introduced at the Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, June 10, and it appears there will be quite a few new features for ‌Apple Maps‌.
