{"title":"iOS 17.2 (Beta) Sticker Reactions Stink","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/ios-17-2-beta-sticker-reactions-thumbs-down/","date":1698437700000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors on the new “use an emoji as a sticker reaction in Messages” feature in iOS 17.2, which just came out today as a public beta:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Instead, to send a sticker response you have to tap and hold on a \nmessage and then choose Add Sticker from the resulting contextual \nmenu, then choose a sticker or emoji. It’s an extra step that \nreally shouldn’t be necessary and makes stickers feel like an \nafterthought, which they apparently are. </p>\n\n<p>It gets worse. When you add a sticker reaction, it’s placed on top of \nthe message you’re reacting to, obscuring part of the text! Why in \nthe world would Apple choose a placement that makes it impossible \nto read the text being responded to? The right placement for these \nreactions is … wait for it … the same place that Tapbacks appear, in \na little bubble snuggled up against the message that’s being \nreacted to. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This design feels more than a bit spiteful to me. I suspect there are two contingents inside Apple: the “<em>Tapbacks are perfect just as they are</em>” side (who prefer there are only six of them — heart, thumbs-up, thumbs-down, ha-ha, “!!”, and “?” — and who insist that they’re monochrome), and the “<em>Jesus H. Christ, every single other popular messaging platform in the world lets users react with any emoji they want, in full color</em>” side. This new emoji-as-stickers feature is a small win for the latter contingent, but the Tapbacks-are-perfect side is calling the shots, and keeping Tapbacks as the only reactions that (a) are super-easy to apply, and (b) don’t obscure the text of the message.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been playing with the feature, and the one emoji I’ve found that <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/emoji-stickers-finger.jpeg\">only <em>barely</em> obscures the text of the message</a> it’s applied to just happens to be the perfect emoji to express my feelings about how this feature currently works: 🖕.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/ios-17-sticker-reactions-stink\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"242d0c84ffba194dcdb360778ec9ce9980b212b8e2c98e3955e462ec366abc35","category":"Tech"}
