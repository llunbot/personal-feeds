Other folding bike locks have been awarded the Bronze and Silver ratings previously, but this is the very first to be strong enough to satisfy the requirements for the Gold rating. The patented 6.5mm riveted joints are responsible for the robustness. On top of that, it also gets Ice Spray Certification, meaning it can’t be frozen and then shattered.</p><div id=\"attachment_277821\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-277821\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock.jpg\" alt=\"seatylock foldylock forever gold sold secure bike lock folding keyhole\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125111/seatylock-foldylock-forever-gold-sold-secure-folding-bike-lock-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-277821\">The locking mechanism is an automotive standard cylinder design</p></div><p>Beyond that, the Foldylock Forever boasts much the same advantages as any other folding lock design, primarily its ability to pack down small making it easier to transport; either in your pack or attached to the bike itself via standard bottle bosses.</p><div id=\"attachment_277824\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-277824\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike.jpg\" alt=\"seatylock foldylock forever gold sold secure bike lock folding\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08125332/foldylock-forever-folded-down-stowed-mounted-on-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-277824\">The Foldylock Forever folding bicycle lock adds 1.76 kg to your ride (not including the mounting bracket)</p></div><p>The Foldylock Forever is pretty large. When packed down, it’s 6.9cm wide, 25cm long, and 7.7cm deep. Fully extended, it has a circumference of 90cm, so should be long enough to secure the frame and wheel to a bicycle stand in most cases. The stainless steel arms are rust-resistant while the plastic coverings are UV-protected.</p><p>We don’t have a price on this one yet. Seatylock is due to launch a Kickstarter campaign this month to fund production.</p><p><a href=\"https://seatylock.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Seatylock.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6f927bb5d3fbf7a9b105d4f8e9d4262892e7bb98243c1e32aac38373f0f9f668","category":"Cycling"}
