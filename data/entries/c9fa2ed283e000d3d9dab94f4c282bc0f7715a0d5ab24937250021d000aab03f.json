That may be why many teachers are turning to ChatGPT for help. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/03/25/how-chatgpt-is-fast-becoming-the-teachers-pet/?sh=b41cbb05177c\">Forbes article</a>, 51 percent of teachers surveyed stated that they had used ChatGPT to help teach, with 10 percent using it daily. ChatGPT can help relay technical information in more <a href=\"https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/technology-and-math-education-chatgpt-is-herenow-what\">basic terms,</a> but it may not always provide the <a href=\"https://www.educationnext.org/chatgpt-is-not-ready-to-teach-geometry-yet/\">correct solution,</a> especially for upper-level math.</p>\n<p>An international team of researchers tested what the software could manage by providing the generative AI program with challenging graduate-level mathematics questions. While ChatGPT failed on a significant number of them, its correct answers suggested that it could be useful for math researchers and teachers as a type of specialized search engine.</p>\n<h2>Portraying ChatGPT’s math muscles</h2>\n<p>The media tends to portray ChatGPT’s mathematical intelligence as either brilliant or incompetent. “Only the extremes have been emphasized,” explained <a href=\"https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/frieder.simon/\">Frieder Simon</a>, a University of Oxford PhD candidate and the study’s lead author. For example, ChatGPT aced Psychology Today’s Verbal-Linguistic Intelligence IQ Test, scoring <a href=\"https://davidrozado.substack.com/p/what-is-the-iq-of-chatgpt\">147 points,</a> but failed miserably on Accounting Today’s <a href=\"https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/we-ran-the-cpa-exam-through-chatgpt-and-it-failed-miserably\">CPA exam.</a> “There’s a middle [road] for some use cases; ChatGPT is performing pretty well [for some students and educators], but for others, not so much,” Simon elaborated.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940663#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940663&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9fa2ed283e000d3d9dab94f4c282bc0f7715a0d5ab24937250021d000aab03f","category":"Tech"}
