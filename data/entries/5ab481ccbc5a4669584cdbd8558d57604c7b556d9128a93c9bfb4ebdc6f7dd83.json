The new saddle keeps the same overall V-shape and dimensions but leverages more advanced materials and carbon construction to shed significant weight. Plus, Prologo refined the Dimension R2’s ergonomics, reworking a 30% wider and more smoothly curved tip to improve rider comfort when perched on the nose of the saddle…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prologo Dimension R2 lightweight short-fit XC &amp; road saddle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Prologo describes <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb18-prologo-dimension-saddles-gain-cpc-proxim-e-mtb-saddle-switches-on/\" target=\"_blank\">the original</a> Dimension as their first short saddle, with an “<em>innovative V-shape design [that] made it one of the most appreciated and used by many champions; a true icon both on and off-road.</em>” With such a popular platform, they were a bit reluctant to change too much, so set about refining it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_lighter-materials-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_lighter-materials-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Dimension R2 lightweight short-fit road and off-road saddle, new light materials\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_lighter-materials-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_lighter-materials-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_lighter-materials-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_lighter-materials-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_lighter-materials-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Prologo)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The big highlight is ~24g weight reduction, mainly shedding grams thanks to a new lightweight EVA foam that gives the same level of support and comfort, but with 20% thinner padding.

Studying how to improve performance, Prologo gave the new Dimension R2 a 2mm wider nose with a more rounded profile for additional comfort. “<em>In addition, the central part has been redesigned and has a flat surface, to facilitate an even more advanced and aerodynamic [riding] position.</em>” </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Dimension R2 lightweight short-fit road and off-road saddle, side profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-297x119.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-1536x614.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-120x48.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-768x307.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_side-profile-2048x819.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>30% wider nose for new 40mm wide Dimension R2 vs. previous 38mm wide Dimension 143</li>\n\n\n\n<li>245x143mm, now available in one size only</li>\n\n\n\n<li>7×9.3mm oval NACK nanocarbon rails made with carbon, kevlar &amp; aluminum reinforcement in the clamping area </li>\n\n\n\n<li>new superlight EVA foam padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>full-length ergonomic pressure-relief cutout</li>\n\n\n\n<li>injected Long Fiber Carbon composite shell</li>\n\n\n\n<li>135g claimed weight</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prologo Dimension R2 – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_black-or-white-top-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_black-or-white-top-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Dimension R2 lightweight short-fit road and off-road saddle, black or white\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_black-or-white-top-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_black-or-white-top-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_black-or-white-top-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_black-or-white-top-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Prologo-Dimension-R2-lightweight-short-fit-road-and-off-road-saddle_black-or-white-top-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new lighter Prologo Dimension R2  saddle is available now online <a href=\"https://prologo.it/products/dimension-r2\" target=\"_blank\">directly from Prologo</a> for 249€, or through their regular dealer network.
