Twelve inches is probably about as small as you want to go, but 18 inches or larger is better.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you’re building a top-end indoor cycling setup for serious training or logging lots of miles on Zwift, then you might even consider a dedicated fan such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-launches-cheaper-kickr-plus-trainer-controlled-fan/\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Kickr Headwind</a>.</span></p>\n<h2>Water bottles</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wahoo Fitness water bottle\" title=\"Wahoo Fitness water bottle\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Water bottles are an essential indoor cycling accessory.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With much less coasting than when riding out on the road, cycling indoors is hard work and you’ll feel the need to drink a lot more.</p>\n<p>Water is fine for short or easy sessions, but for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/zwift-racing/\">Zwift racing</a> or longer virtual training rides, you might consider an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-energy-drinks-for-cycling/\">energy drink</a>.</p>\n<p>Our best advice is to get two bottles and to always fill up both before your ride, unless you’re absolutely sure one bottle will be enough for your session.</p>\n<p>Running out of fluids mid-turbo session is never a pleasant experience.

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">best p<span>ower meters</span></a><span> have come down in price considerably in recent years, and while they’re great for tracking your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/indoor-vs-outdoor-cycle-training/\">outdoor training exploits</a> in fine detail, the real value of a power meter is as a specialised training tool. </span></p>\n<p><span>Okay, so a power meter isn’t an indoor training essential, but with one on your bike you can do proper <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-take-ftp-test-zwift/\">FTP testing</a>, train in specific <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">power zones</a> and use interactive apps on any kind of trainer (not just a smart trainer).</span></p>\n<p>Even if you do have a smart trainer, it’s likely it’ll measure power slightly differently from a power meter on your bike, so true training devotees who want the most consistent data possible might be better served with a single power meter they can use inside and out.</p>\n<p>There are lots of options on the market, with the main consideration generally being around where you want to measure power.</p>\n<p>Pedal-based power meters are easy to swap between bikes, but you might need to get used to a different cleat system.</p>\n<p><span>If you’re a Shimano or SRAM user, there are plenty of crank-based options. </span><span>The downside with these is that swapping cranks between bikes is a more involved process, and in some cases you may need to install a new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a>.</span></p>\n<h2>Heart-rate monitor</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A much more affordable alternative to a power meter, if you want to guide your training with additional data, is a heart-rate monitor.</p>\n<p>Given that all smart trainers will have an in-built power meter, a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-choose-a-heart-rate-monitor/\">heart-rate monitor</a> can then be used to better understand how your body is responding to training, as well as other external factors that may be impacting how you feel on the bike.</p>\n<p>After all, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-vs-heart-rate/\">power isn’t everything</a> when it comes to cycling.</p>\n<p>By combining power, heart rate and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/rating-of-perceived-exertion/\">Rate of Perceived Exertion</a>, you can build up a fuller picture of your training.</p>\n<h2>Trainer

upgrade.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’re back into luxury territory here, but if you want to build the ultimate indoor cycling setup, a dedicated trainer desk puts everything you need within arm’s reach.</p>\n<p>It should be built for the job, too, with a non-slip top and smooth-rolling wheels to manoeuvre the desk around the garage or workshop.</p>\n<p>Look for a desk that offers height adjustment and an angled design to keep your ride essentials within grasp, without getting in the way of your bike’s front wheel.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are lots of more affordable alternatives to a cycling-specific desk, but the same principles apply – you want to keep everything close and secure, but out of the way of your bike.</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Simon von
