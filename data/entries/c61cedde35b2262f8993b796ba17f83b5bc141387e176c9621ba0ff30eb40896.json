The UK-based mountain bike brand of probably the winningest gravity family ever, Atherton has come a long way from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-athertons-launch-their-own-bike-brand-tease-dw-link-carbon-dh-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">that first prototype DH bike</a> made of carbon tubes bonded into 3D-printed lugs.

A 170 or 180mm Fox 38 is standard option for their current carbon &amp; ti AM170.
