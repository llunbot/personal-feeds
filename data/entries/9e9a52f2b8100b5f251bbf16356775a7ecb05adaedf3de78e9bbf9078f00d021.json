Fausto Bertoglio was racing the Giro d’Italia with the Jollj Ceramica team on a Pinarello bicycle. In the end, it would be the 26-year-old Italian’s first and only Grand Tour win. The 1975 Giro d’Italia would also be the first Grand Tour win for Pinarello Bicycles, and just the start of the brand’s 30 — and counting — Grand Tour victories to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To commemorate the 50th anniversary of this historic victory and the beginning of the brand’s winning tradition, Pinarello is producing the Dogma F Edizione Speciale. This special edition bike will be ridden by the INEOS Grenadiers team on stage 14 of the Giro d’Italia on Saturday, May 24th. This stage was chosen specifically because it starts in Pinarello’s home city of Treviso, just outside of the brand’s headquarters. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fausto Bertoglio wins 1975 Giro d’Italia as a first for Pinarello</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975.webp\"><img width=\"1146\" height=\"764\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975.webp\" alt=\"Fausto Bertoglio racing in the 1975 Giro d'Italia on a Pinarello bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975.webp 1146w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-1975-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Fausto Bertoglio racing his Pinarello bike to victory at the 1975 Giro d’Italia. <em>(All photos/Pinarello)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello President Fausto Pinarello said: “<em>We are proud to mark such a landmark moment in Pinarello’s history by launching the Dogma F Edizione Speciale. Fausto Bertoglio’s victory in 1975 was one of grit, determination, and incredible panache, and his relentless attacks on the Stelvio helped earn him his victory in improbable circumstances.” </em>He went on to say: “<em>The Giro d’Italia is part of our DNA too, and seeing the INEOS Grenadiers compete on this beautiful bike on stage 14 – which starts right outside our headquarters – will be an equally special moment.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-pinarello-dogma-f-2024/\">Pinarello Dogma F</a> is a superlight and aerodynamic carbon race bike from the future, and it bears little resemblance to the bike ridden to victory by Bertoglio 50 years ago. But the modern superbike gets an Edizione Speciale paint scheme using colors resembling the winning Pinarello from 1975. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint.webp\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint.webp\" alt=\"Side view of the cockpit, head tube, fork, and custom painted wheels on the Special Edition Pinarello Dogma F.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-custom-paint-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The custom painted frame and Princeton Wake wheels.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal.webp\"><img width=\"1003\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal.webp\" alt=\"Detail shot of the 50th anniversary decal on the top tube of the Special Edition Pinarello Dogma F.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal.webp 1003w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal-768x511.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-Special-Edition-50-year-decal-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>50th anniversary decal on the top tube.</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The special edition paint job also includes the letters GPT (Giovanni Pinarello Treviso) on the fork, commemorating the brand’s founder and origins. A 50th anniversary decal on the top tube marks the special occasion. And if the bike wasn’t already eye-catching and lust-worthy enough, the complete Dogma F Edizione Speciale bikes come with custom-painted <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/princeton-carbon-works-wake-6560-evolution-wheelset/\">Princeton Wake wheels</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Pinarello, this launch also marks the start of an ES (Edizione Speciale) line. The brand will be celebrating certain performances in its history with custom bikes offered in limited quantities. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pinarello Dogma F Edizione Speciale for Giro Victory 50th Anniversary</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side.webp\"><img width=\"971\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side.webp\" alt=\"Studio image, side view of the Pinarello Dogma F Edizione Speciale\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side.webp 971w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinarello-Dogma-F-special-edition-stuio-side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of limited quantities, only 100 units of the Dogma F Edizione Speciale will be available for purchase through Pinarello dealers. It is being sold as a complete bike or frame-only. Build specs and pricing information were not provided, but it appears to be a Dura-Ace drivetrain and brakes in the photos. If we had to guess, it’s probably going to be pretty expensive, given the price of the stock Dogma F frame and Princeton Wake wheels, adding up to a cool $10,100 at the bare minimum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, if you’re keen on celebrating Pinarello’s 50th anniversary of its first Grand Tour win at the Giro d’Italia bikes, the Dogma F Edizione Speciale will be on sale between May 24th and June 15th, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://pinarello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinarello.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pinarello-celebrates-50th-anniversary-of-giro-ditalia-victory-with-the-dogma-f-edizione-speciale/\">Pinarello Celebrates 50th Anniversary of Giro d’Italia Victory with Dogma F Edizione Speciale</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9e9a52f2b8100b5f251bbf16356775a7ecb05adaedf3de78e9bbf9078f00d021","category":"Cycling"}
