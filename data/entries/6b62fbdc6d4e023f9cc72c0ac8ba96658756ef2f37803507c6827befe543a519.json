Orrick <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Andersen-v-Stability-AI-Order-on-Motions-to-Dismiss-and-Strike-10-30-2023.pdf\">dismissed</a> many of the artists' claims after finding that the proposed class-action complaint \"is defective in numerous respects.\" Perhaps most notably, two of the three named plaintiffs—independent artist Kelly McKernan and concept artist/professional illustrator Karla Ortiz—had apparently never registered any of their disputed works with the Copyright Office. Orrick dismissed their claims with prejudice, dropping them from the suit.</p>\n<p>But while McKernan and Ortiz can no longer advance their claims, the lawsuit is far from over. Lead plaintiff, cartoonist, and illustrator Sarah Andersen will have the next 30 days to amend her complaint and keep the copyright dispute alive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980244#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b62fbdc6d4e023f9cc72c0ac8ba96658756ef2f37803507c6827befe543a519","category":"Tech"}
