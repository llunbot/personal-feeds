Apple’s keynote seemed so adamant about nixing leather that I suspect there are fans of the Hermès leather straps who are disappointed, thinking they’re no longer being produced. But I can see why Apple decided against mentioning it. I don’t think this is an awkward state of affairs, but <em>describing it</em> during the keynote would have been awkward.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/15/hermes-leather-apple-watch-straps\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"86b28d60614054f8b42a1018eac90b7f9cda2e4a67ed39dfdafa44a4505d43c5","category":"Tech"}
