The item trackers have a blemish on one side and a \"Perfectly Imperfect\" engraving on the other side.<blockquote>\"Chipolo is excited to introduce the 'Perfectly Imperfect' limited series of CARD Spot trackers, as it's another testament to our dedication to create products that make our lives easier -- both physically, through functionality and mentally, by helping to bring people peace of mind\", said Primož Zelenšek, Co-founder and CEO at Chipolo. \"Through this campaign, we want to inspire a shift in perspective, encouraging people to embrace their imperfections and recognize the real beauty in what makes each of us irreplaceable.\"</blockquote>The Chipolo CARD Spot is designed to fit inside a wallet, and it works with Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> network. The CARD Spot can be tracked right alongside Apple devices and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTag</a> in the ‌Find My‌ app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChipolo plans to donate $1 to a non-profit organization for each of the CARD Spots that are sold, and each one is <a href=\"https://chipolo.net/en-us/\">priced at $35</a>, the same as the standard CARD Spots. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chipolo/\">Chipolo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">CES 2024</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-chipolo-card-spot/\">CES 2024: Chipolo Launches 'Perfectly Imperfect' Find My Wallet Trackers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-chipolo-launches-perfectly-imperfect-find-my-wallet-trackers.2415752/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7adc61c3421bfa0aa2e0f7407cf4c7f1e657cedd4a795692aae0a9fae7a7c65d","category":"Apple"}
