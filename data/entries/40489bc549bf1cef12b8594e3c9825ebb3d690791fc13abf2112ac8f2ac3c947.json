These bikes feature non-boost spacing, thru-axles, and disc brakes, designed for dirt riding and touring. If you live in the USA, ordering one from Japan is expensive, but Crust Bikes brought in a few frames from Crumbworks and now only a size large remains. Available in raw for the paint finish of your choice or run it raw for $2,100.
