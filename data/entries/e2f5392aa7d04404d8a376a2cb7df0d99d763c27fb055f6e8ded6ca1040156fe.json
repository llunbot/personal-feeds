The initial awards are not huge; each is a few tens of millions of dollars. But this work will set the stage for a demonstration phase, which will be worth significantly more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014744#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014744&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e2f5392aa7d04404d8a376a2cb7df0d99d763c27fb055f6e8ded6ca1040156fe","category":"Tech"}
