The technical hydraulic internals are the same <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=bikeyoke+revive\" target=\"_blank\">proven Revive mechanical dropper technologies</a>, down to the fact that the wireless post shares the same service parts as the regular Revives. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Revive Wireless electronic MTB dropper seatpost, dropped\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s kind of a huge deal, because this is going to be an expensive dropper, but you can be sure that the post will continue to go up and down smoothly for a long time, and any bounce you get from air sneaking past its internal seals is easily corrected with the little <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/updates-reset-on-the-fly-bikeyoke-revive-dropper-seatpost/\" target=\"_blank\">Revive reset</a> lever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Revive Wireless electronic MTB dropper seatpost, USB-C remote\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-on-the-bar-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Revive Wireless dropper communicates with its wireless remote via Bluetooth LE. That also means there is an opportunity for a bit of adjustability in the speed of return via a companion mobile app, but you won’t need an app to use or even set up the dropper. Both remote &amp; dropper have 2 tiny LEDs (red &amp; green) that will show the battery status of each other at a simple glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Revive Wireless electronic MTB dropper seatpost, remote detail with LEDs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_self-contained-remote-with-indicator-LEDs-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both wireless dropper and remote have their own self-contained li-ion internal battery that is said to work for ‘several’ months of regular use, rechargeable with a standard USB-C port on each. That means removing the post from your bike to charge, which Stefan says is kind of a bonus feature to make sure mountain bike riders don’t leave their post in forever until it seizes in their frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Revive Wireless electronic MTB dropper seatpost, internal recharging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_USB-C-from-inside-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BikeYoke says the new wireless dropper is actually even a bit lighter than the original versions. The electric actuator that opens and closes the valve to operate the post does add a bit of weight, but that is offset by the fact that the small self-contained wireless remote is considerably lighter than a mechanical remote with a long segment of continuous housing and wire cable inside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The addition of the actuator does add about 13mm more overall post insertion length at the bottom of the dropper, but BikeYoke has also trimmed roughly 5mm of stack off the post’s head – resulting in the wireless dropper being about 10mm longer than a mechanical Revive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Drops</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtwXKgPOa7H/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtwXKgPOa7H/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by BikeRumor (@bikerumor)</a></p></div></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard remote is super tiny and made to take up minimal space on the bar – it will be an injection molded plastic part in final production, likely with a removable alloy clamp. It requires very little force to actuate, and felt as fast as any mechanical dropper I’ve used. There’s not a ton of tactile feedback pushing a tiny button in about 2-3mm to drop the post (compared to the long throw of a mechanical dropper remote). But it only took me about 3 pushes of the button to get a sense for the fast press-then-drop motion, and it was of course, a lot easier than any mechanical remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Revive Wireless electronic MTB dropper seatpost, integrated remote\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_tiny-reote-with-battery-inside-the-bar-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BikeYoke also showed us an even smaller remote that uses a small wired-in separate battery that can be mounted inside of a handlebar for bars with internal shift wire routing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Revive Wireless electronic MTB dropper seatpost, internal battery OEM option\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_EM-remote-option-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That will likely be an OEM-only option at least at first, but it reiterates the possibilities of how easily you can operate a wireless dropper with all sorts of remote. BikeYoke also makes their own lock-on multi-density <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikeyoke-grippy-grips-lock-on-31mm-diameter-eccentric-honeycomb-rubber/\" target=\"_blank\">Grippy</a> grips, and has considered the possibility they could even integrate the remote button into one of their grips in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting possibilities, indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>BikeYoke Revive Wireless Dropper – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Revive Wireless electronic MTB dropper seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Revive-Wireless-electronic-MTB-dropper-seatpost_dropped-out-of-the-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially the new BikeYoke Revive Wireless is a MY24 (<em>model year 2024</em>) product meaning you will have to wait until the start of next year to get one – ideally they should be ready for consumers by the spring riding season. That’s still quite a ways off, and as BikeYoke finalize some of the production details in their remote, they still don’t have an official price yet. But on-the-record/off-the-record, they suggested that BikeYoke are targeting a retail price that’s a good bit cheaper than the SRAM AXS dropper or maybe half again more expensive than mechanical Revive posts – including the wireless remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for sizes, it will essentially be offered in all the same options as the mechanically-actuated Revives since they share a lot of functional internals – so that means at least 30.9 &amp; 31.6mm diameters, and travel options from 125mm up to 213mm. It might come in this silver anodized version if there is good response prior to production, otherwise they can always fall back on black.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prototype modular platform pedal project</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Prototype modular platform pedal project, low-profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_low-profile-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another prototype project are these modular platform mountain bike pedals.

These prototype pedals are machined from slippery Delrin engineered plastic with 7 long replaceable traction pins per side, and 4 bolts that hold the alloy &amp; plastic bits together. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Prototype modular platform pedal project, flats\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-Prototype-modular-platform-pedal-project_top-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that BikeYoke have ironed out the materials and connection points, the next step will be optimizing the lower leading edge of the pedals’ outer platform to slide over trailside obstacles. We’ll keep tabs on the next stages of BikeYoke flat pedal development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prototype 35mm comfort mountain bike handlebars, too!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Prototype 35mm comfort mountain bike handlebar detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-detail-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new BikeYoke wireless dropper also happened to be mounted on top of some in-development carbon mountain bike bars that weren’t entirely round. With a flattened profile in the rise of the bars, BikeYoke is able to balance some real vertical comfort with the torsional stiffness of modern 35mm diameter bars. The bars also feature titanium mesh reinforcement in the brake/shifter/remote clamping area for extra security.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back.jpg\" alt=\"BikeYoke Prototype 35mm comfort mountain bike handlebars, too!\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BikeYoke-prototype-35mm-comfort-mountain-bike-handlebars-back-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BikeYoke says the new carbon bars don’t have a set release date yet, as they are still working to optimize layup to get the best rider comfort, while still passing the most stringent strength, stress &amp; impact-resistance testing on the market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t worry, I personally find just about every modern 35mm bar too stiff, so I’m be keeping a close eye on this project and will share more news whenever I know more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for sure, we’ve put our name on a short list to test the BikeYoke Revive Wireless dropper as soon as one is ready to review!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeyoke.de/\"><em>Bikeyoke.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikeyoke-first-looks-revive-wireless-dropper-post-plus-new-pedals-handlebar-prototypes/\">BikeYoke First Looks: Revive Wireless Dropper Post, plus New Pedals &amp; Handlebar Prototypes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8945b7c94c1819bdd52956008cea41acc57a56bcf0303f57e48f36c2556550af","category":"Cycling"}
