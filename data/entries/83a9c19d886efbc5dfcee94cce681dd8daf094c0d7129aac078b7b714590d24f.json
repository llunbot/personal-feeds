{"title":"The History of Regular Expressions","link":"https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-regular-expression-edition","date":1627348405000,"content":"\n<p>Buzz Andersen, in a guest post for Why Is This Interesting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Eventually, a Russian artist and Twitter user named Gregory\nKhodyrev <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregoryKhodyrev/status/1369658173334884360\">realized</a> what was going on: someone at Russia’s\nstate Internet censor, Roscomnadzor, had attempted to block the\nInternet domain “t.co” (used by Twitter’s URL shortener), but had\ninstead managed to cut off access to <em>any</em> domain containing the\ntext pattern “t.co.” This meant that sites such as\n“microsoft.com,” “reddit.com,” and even Russia’s own state media\noutlet “rt.com” were rendered suddenly inaccessible.</p>\n\n<p>Readers with a modicum of technical knowledge may already have an\ninkling of what likely happened here: some hapless censor,\nattempting to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/world/europe/russia-twitter.html\">curb Twitter’s political influence</a>, installed a\nURL pattern matching rule on Russia’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/28/russia-great-firewall-sovereign-internet-bill-keeping-information-in-or-out\">national firewall</a> that\nturned out to have been just a tad overzealous. The rule in\nquestion was almost certainly expressed using a notoriously\nabstruse notation called a “regular expression.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/26/andersen-regex-history\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"83a9c19d886efbc5dfcee94cce681dd8daf094c0d7129aac078b7b714590d24f","category":"Tech"}
