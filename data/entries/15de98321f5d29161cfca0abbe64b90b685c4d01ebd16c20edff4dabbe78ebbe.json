And then some go all out and build themselves a bike. Nick sent in his XXXXL SuperBoost all-road for this week’s Readers’ Rides. Let’s check it out! </em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-9.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-9.jpeg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-9.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-9.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Whenever I used to post a picture bike that I made on the internet, someone would inevitably ask if I’d heard of 36” wheels. I had, but hadn’t heard of any 36” tires that weren’t made for unicycles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-5.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-5.jpeg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-5.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-5.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Just in time for the 32” revolution to finally come in earnest for us super-tall people in the form of one (or maybe now several?) decent-seeming tire(s), I present my super-boost-spaced road bike built for 29×2.6” tires. Until there is a 32” Schwalbe Ice Spiker available, it will be good enough for me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-8.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-8.jpeg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-8.jpeg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-8.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-7.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-7.jpeg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-7.jpeg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-7.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My goal for this bicycle was to make a fast all-roader that could maybe go out and race that would also help me get through winters without going stir-crazy once I was separated from my old local trail. I built it at my old house in a hurry, ran out of time before I had to start moving equipment. It hung in a storage unit for a year as I moved and got a workshop set up again in the last month. I wanted it to have as many components in common with my hardtail mtb as was reasonable and feasible. Finding reliable components is hard when you are my size, and I wanted to be able to swap trusted wheels, seat posts, and most of the drivetrain between bikes in a pinch.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-4.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-4.jpeg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-4.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-4.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I still need to add braze-ons and shorten brake lines, but I got the front brake working this morning and wrapped the bars, so it started to feel like a real bike. I took it out on the ice, and it was fast, fun, and reasonably comfortable for a new bike. I need to spend time dialing it in, but I am optimistic that it is going to have a major positive impact on my coming spring and summer, as well as my overall fitness, which is not where it used to be.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-2.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-2.jpeg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-2.jpeg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Nick-XXXXL-SuperBoost-All-Road-2.jpeg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For the last three years I have had only one bike: a long travel hardtail MTB. It was fine when I lived a mile from the trail in East Saint Paul, Minnesota, but I have moved to Ashland, WI, and good singletrack is now a half-hour drive away. I am looking forward to being able to venture from my house and explore a new area without driving to a trailhead.</p>\n<p><strong>Build Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bars: Nitto/Crust Shaka</li>\n<li>Brakes/Shifter: TRP Hylex RS/Gevenalle 1×11 SRAM</li>\n<li>Seatpost: One UP V3 240mm dropper(not yet cabled)</li>\n<li>Saddle: Brooks Cambium C19</li>\n<li>Crank: Zinn 190mm MTB</li>\n<li>Winter Pedals: Chromag Dagga</li>\n<li>Chainring: Garbaruk 0mm offset 42 tooth</li>\n<li>Derrailleur/Casette: Sram Gx 11 speed/ 11-42 XD cassette</li>\n<li>Hubs: Dt Swiss 350 157×12/110×15 32 hole, 6 bolt</li>\n<li>Rims/Spokes: Sun Duroc sd42/DT Swiss alpine III</li>\n<li>Frame: Reynolds 853 tubes and Paragon parts for Syntace dropouts.
