I have several Meross plugs in my home, including this power strip, and I can’t say enough good things about it. Where I’ve had occasional issues with other plugs and power strips, the Meross devices in the house have been rock-solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are few if any HomeKit power strips available so if you know someone who needs one (or just want to build out your own Siri smart home), grab one right now at a fantastic price.</p>\n\nSmart Home</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"520bfc396b7603987f8e799f1729aee4aa143336d6537a740b5eb689c3fda321","category":"Apple"}
