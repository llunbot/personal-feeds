Apple reported $2.6 billion spent on warranty claims in the 2021 fiscal year, down nearly 45% from $4.6 billion spent in the 2016 fiscal year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's warranty-related expenses have declined each fiscal year since 2016:<ul><li>2015: $4.4B</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>2016: $4.6B</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>2017: $4.3B</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>2018: $4.1B</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>2019: $3.8B</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>2020: $2.9B</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>2021: $2.6B</li></ul>Apple does not provide a breakdown of its warranty expenses, but one possibility for the decline is Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/04/rip-butterfly-keyboard/\">ditching the problematic butterfly keyboard</a> in Macs. First introduced in the now-discontinued 12-inch MacBook in 2015, followed by the MacBook Pro in 2016 and the MacBook Air in 2018, the butterfly keyboard can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/\">exhibit \"sticky\" or unresponsive keys over time</a>, which led Apple to launch a service program offering free repairs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe following MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro models are eligible for the program for up to four years after first retail sale of the computer:<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, Early 2015)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook (Retina, 12­-inch, Early 2016)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, 2017)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2019)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (13­-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2016)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2017)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2018)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2019)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>Apple offering free butterfly keyboard replacements was a costly endeavor, as the keyboard is integrated with the \"top case,\" which is essentially a part of the MacBook's aluminum chassis that also houses the trackpad and a glued-in battery. Apple is still running the program for eligible MacBook models, but claims have likely dropped, as Apple went back to a more reliable scissor switch keyboard design starting with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2019 and the company no longer sells any new Macs with butterfly keyboards.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are likely other contributing factors to the decline in Apple's warranty expenses. For example, starting with iPhone 12 models, Apple is able to replace the rear glass <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/iphone-12-pro-same-unit-repair/\">without replacing the entire iPhone</a>, which reduces costs. There were likely pandemic-related impacts too, such as Apple Store closures in the early part of the 2021 fiscal year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's Form-10K reveals a few other details, including that the company had approximately 154,000 full-time employees as of September 25, 2021 and that it spent $21.9 billion on research and development in the 2021 fiscal year.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/\">Butterfly Keyboard Issues</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/29/apples-warranty-expenses-declining/\">Apple's Warranty Expenses Have Significantly Declined Since Ditching the Butterfly Keyboard in Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-warranty-expenses-have-significantly-declined-since-ditching-the-butterfly-keyboard-in-macs.2320549/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zwvSiifMgTI:Nm0urtTn63c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zwvSiifMgTI:Nm0urtTn63c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zwvSiifMgTI\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"303ba5cc2ec743b063e6b8b317654ee79c0739ea8cecd0d26caff5d2c0a3466a","category":"Apple"}
