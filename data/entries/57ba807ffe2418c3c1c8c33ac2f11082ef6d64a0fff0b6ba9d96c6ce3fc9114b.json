That means it could arrive alongside the iPhone 15 at the fall event and begin shipping in mid-September. Before the 2nd-gen model arrived, Apple previously updated the AirPods Pro case with MagSafe charging in October 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I think this is likely the USB-C version of the AirPods Pro 2, with mass shipments expected in 2Q23-3Q23. By the way, Apple currently appears to have no plans for USB-C versions of the AirPods 2 &amp; 3.<br /><br />我覺得這應該是AirPods Pro… <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/aWKJvGh1lW&amp;xcust=1-1-1671083-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/aWKJvGh1lW</a></p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1639249902483173376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1671083-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">March 24, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new case isn’t expected to bring any improvements other than the new port. The second-generation AirPods Pro case features a speaker and lanyard loop, and can also be charged with an Apple Watch charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Kuo also says Apple “currently appears to have no plans for USB-C versions” of its other AirPods cases for the 2nd- and 3rd-generation models. That could mean Apple is planning larger changes to those models than just a new case. (Apple is rumored to be releasing a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1445431/airpods-lite-earpods-budget.html\">lower-end AirPods Lite model</a> for $99.) Or it’s possible that the new case merely arrives when Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">updates the AirPods 3</a> next year.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"57ba807ffe2418c3c1c8c33ac2f11082ef6d64a0fff0b6ba9d96c6ce3fc9114b","category":"Apple"}
