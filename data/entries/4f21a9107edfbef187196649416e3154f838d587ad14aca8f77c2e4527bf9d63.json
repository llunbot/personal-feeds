But it’s even better when you can get one for this cheap: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSVB8BP1?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 41mm Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSTY93PP?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">45mm Apple Watch Series 9</a> for $299 and $329, respectively, a savings of $100 and 25 percent off the MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 has either a 41mm or 45mm display with two exclusive features: an S9 chip that’s faster and smarter with a new four-core Neural Engine, and the new double-tap gesture that lets you control apps without touching the screen. Otherwise, it’s got the same array of sensors—ECG, heart rate, and temperature. (It also has a blood-oxygen sensor, though Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2202755/kill-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-tool.html\">turned off functionality</a> due to an ongoing patent dispute. It <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2264791/there-may-be-hope-for-apple-watches-sold-with-disabled-blood-oxygen-sensors.html\">may return</a> in the future though.) You’ll also get 18 hours of battery life, 50 meters of water resistance, Emergency SOS, and Crash Detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2114964/apple-watch-series-9-review.html\">4-star review</a>, we praised the Apple Watch Series 9 as “the best smartwatch Apple has ever made.” And at this price, it’s practically a steal, so go grab one before the price goes back up</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4f21a9107edfbef187196649416e3154f838d587ad14aca8f77c2e4527bf9d63","category":"Apple"}
