{"title":"Apple to Launch Two iPad Air and Two OLED iPad Pro Models Early Next Year","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/","date":1701885221000,"content":"To boost falling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> sales, Apple has a major refresh planned for the ‌iPad‌ lineup in early 2024, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/apple-prepares-m3-macbook-air-and-revamped-ipad-pro-for-early-next-year\">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>. Apple plans to debut new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, both of which will feature notable changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/12.9-inch-ipad-pro-cyber.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌iPad Air‌ will come in two sizes like the ‌iPad Pro‌ for the first time. The smaller model will continue to measure in at 10.9 inches, but the larger version will be 12.9 inches, like the larger ‌iPad Pro‌. Apple is aiming to provide more variety between screen size and price, and the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ will be more affordable than the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's 2024 ‌iPad Pro‌ models will feature OLED displays, a first for the ‌iPad‌ lineup. Apple has been using OLED technology for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and the Apple Watch, but larger OLED screens are more expensive. Compared to LED or mini-LED, OLED brings deeper blacks and more vivid colors. OLED displays will be a Pro-only feature, with the ‌iPad Air‌ to continue to use standard displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman says that the high-end version of the ‌iPad Pro‌ will be equipped with the new M3 chip that Apple introduced earlier this year. The M3 is built on 3-nanometer technology, and it will bring notable graphics improvement over the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip that is currently used in the ‌iPad Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will refresh the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> and the low-cost ‌iPad‌ in 2024, but it is unclear if these tablets will be updated at the same time as the ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo go along with the updated iPads, Apple plans to introduce a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> and new Magic Keyboards. The updated Magic Keyboards are said to have a sturdier frame made from aluminum, which will allow the ‌iPad‌ to more closely resemble a laptop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere were no iPads released in 2023, which is the first time that Apple has not debuted a new tablet during a calendar year. ‌iPad‌ revenue came in at $28.3 billion in 2023, down from $29.3 billion in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad Pro‌ models and their accompanying accessories are expected to launch around the end of March, which is also when Apple plans to release iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4. Apple is likely to hold a March event to introduce the new devices.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/\">Apple to Launch Two iPad Air and Two OLED iPad Pro Models Early Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-two-ipad-air-and-two-oled-ipad-pro-models-early-next-year.2412987/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"092f48bc6950585238a45b799ccbec75bcd92a089f7b8b8188fe0c4816fc63e0","category":"Apple"}
