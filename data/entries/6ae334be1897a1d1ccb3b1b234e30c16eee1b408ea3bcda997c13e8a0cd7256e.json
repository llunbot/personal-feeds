The investment is described as a \"first phase\" of Apple's potential involvement in the country. The offer marks a tenfold increase from Apple's previous proposal earlier this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe negotiation stems from Indonesia's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/\">October ban on iPhone 16 sales</a> after authorities determined Apple had not met the country's requirement for 40% domestic content in smartphones. The government previously rejected Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/\">initial $10 million offer</a>, followed by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/\">$100 million proposal</a> that included plans for research and development facilities and developer academies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe government is particularly interested in having Apple establish local manufacturing partnerships and source components domestically. Apple has maintained developer academies in Indonesia since 2018, but the country currently hosts no Apple manufacturing facilities. Apple has not responded to requests for comment regarding the latest investment proposal.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-iphone-ban/\">Apple Raises Indonesia Investment Offer to $1B Amid iPhone Ban</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-to-1b-amid-iphone-ban.2444516/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ae334be1897a1d1ccb3b1b234e30c16eee1b408ea3bcda997c13e8a0cd7256e","category":"Apple"}
