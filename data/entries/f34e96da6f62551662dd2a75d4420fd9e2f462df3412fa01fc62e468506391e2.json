Join us for an ascent of this majestic climb in the Rhône-Alpes…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pain de sportif</em> is a brioche baked with dried fruits and nuts, and one most deserving of its name and favour among the cyclists of the Savoie department. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because here is where giants rub shoulders, where <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-de-la-croix-de-fer-climb-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Croix de Fer</a> faces off with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-du-galibier-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Galibier</a> as Iseran looks on, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-du-petit-saint-bernard\" target=\"_blank\">Petit Saint-Bernard</a> at her heel. This part of France requires dense calories, and that’s precisely where any rider looking to tackle the Cormet de Roselend should begin: ordering a slice of <em>pain de sportif</em> from Beaufort’s favourite bakery, Pouilloux Boulangerie.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161614/cormet-de-roselend-02-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161614/cormet-de-roselend-02-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161614/cormet-de-roselend-02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161614/cormet-de-roselend-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161614/cormet-de-roselend-02-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161614/cormet-de-roselend-02-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161614/cormet-de-roselend-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Dan Milner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Beaufort, of course, is most famous for its cheese, and though it seems desperately unlikely as you sit on your top tube just shaded by Pouilloux’s red awnings, you’d swear you can detect a pungent bass note to the pine-fresh air. You’d also swear that the road was already nosing upwards. And you’d be right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Col hopping</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cormet de Roselend’s stats are more enticing than alarming (‘cormet’, by the way, is local speak for ‘col’). The climb official starts at 745m in Beaufort and culminates just shy of 2,000m some 20km later. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161657/cormet-de-roselend-03-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161657/cormet-de-roselend-03-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161657/cormet-de-roselend-03-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161657/cormet-de-roselend-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161657/cormet-de-roselend-03-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161657/cormet-de-roselend-03-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14161657/cormet-de-roselend-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Passing the Sainte Marie Madeleine Chapel on the banks of the Lac de Roselend</figcaption><figcaption>Dan Milner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The average gradient is therefore 6%, which makes it one of the more sedate climbs in the area. But that’s not why cyclists – those in the know, anyway – come here. Rather, they ride for the postcard beauty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you roll serenely through the first couple of hairpins you’ll be wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, by the time you see the little yellow and white sign with the tell-tale cartoon cyclist and the number five, you might begin to worry that the climb is a little, well… dull.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-french-alps\">Best places to cycle in the French Alps</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-de-la-loze-cycling\">The untouched col: Col de la Loze Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Yes, the adjacent stream has been babbling obligingly; yes, the road surface is undeniably good, but the view has been monotonously the same, flanked by a zoetrope of spindly conifers straining their tips skywards in regimental fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, depending when you come to the southeast of France, the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes can be searingly hot, so this level of coverage may well prove advantageous.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162154/cormet-de-roselend-04-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162154/cormet-de-roselend-04-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162154/cormet-de-roselend-04-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162154/cormet-de-roselend-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162154/cormet-de-roselend-04-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162154/cormet-de-roselend-04-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162154/cormet-de-roselend-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Stone markers tick off all 20 kilometres of the Cormet de Roselend climb from Beaufort – Cormet is the local word for ‘col’, and Beaufort is indeed the home of the cheese</figcaption><figcaption>Dan Milner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Road signs by the kilometre six marker look more promising. A first proper mention is given to the Barrage de Roselend, the dam that helps give this climb its beautiful reputation. The red triangular ‘verglas fréquent’ sign showing a car skidding, and the accompanying snow chains warning is also encouraging in that it lets you know high elevation is on its way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gradually the sky-forest ratio opens up, and with it a view over the smooth Alpine pastures the Beaufort dairy herds keep so diligently landscaped. One bend further and finally you can see charcoal peaks pocketed with snow. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05-728x970.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162228/cormet-de-roselend-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Dan Milner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s not the col you’ve come for, but the intersection of this and a road to your right marks the 1,605m point that is the top of the Col de Méraillet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Faith restores</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The road flattens as you pass Le Chalet de Roselend hotel, whose rear terrace overlooks the Lac de Roselend, and which depending on how hard you’re attacking this climb may well be a pleasant coffee stop.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06-728x970.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162306/cormet-de-roselend-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Dan Milner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Depending on the time of year the dam may be exposing its banks, which today are sandy scree but once upon a time were the same verdant greens you see all around you.

The payoff is rapid height gain plus a doubling back of the road, which means you can finally see Lac de Roselend’s dam. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This buttressed grey expanse sweeps pleasingly between a distant cleft in the mountains, hemming in its waters.

The Cormet de Roselend road has taken an unexpected dive between a cleft of its own.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09-728x970.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162508/cormet-de-roselend-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Dan Milner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Emerging from between the rock faces is like happening upon a new land. The feel of the air is different – cooler, crisper and with a lick of wind. There is water in the form of a small river several metres below, but beyond that the look is much more like dale or moor. It’s craggy; on the wrong weather day this level of exposure would be bleak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A refuge and car park are the first signs of human life for a while, and could mark the top, but the road has other ideas. It looks at times flat, but this is a falsehood eyes are led into by not being able to see where the road is going. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It tucks itself in and out of rocky bumps, but these soon peel away in favour of meadow and the space to observe snow-spattered peaks.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162551/cormet-de-roselend-10-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162551/cormet-de-roselend-10-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162551/cormet-de-roselend-10-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162551/cormet-de-roselend-10-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162551/cormet-de-roselend-10-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162551/cormet-de-roselend-10-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/14162551/cormet-de-roselend-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The deli at the summit of the Cormet de Roselend sells all manner of fatty comestibles, including cheese</figcaption><figcaption>Dan Milner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Finally a large sign appears, built into substantial stone and adorned with its own shingle roof. <em>Merci de votre visite et à bientôt en Beaufortain</em> it says cheerily. Just behind it is a red-white striped delicatessen of sorts, selling sandwiches and the legendary local cheese. There’s that smell again. And then there’s that sign you’ve been looking for: ‘Cormet de Roselend, altitude 1,968m’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s probably a few metres more than your bike computer has registered but scalps based on elevation were never the point here anyway. You came for the views and you were rewarded with one of the most tranquil climbs the Alps has to offer.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cormet-de-roselend-cycling\">Classic Tour de France climb: Cormet de Roselend</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f34e96da6f62551662dd2a75d4420fd9e2f462df3412fa01fc62e468506391e2","category":"Cycling"}
