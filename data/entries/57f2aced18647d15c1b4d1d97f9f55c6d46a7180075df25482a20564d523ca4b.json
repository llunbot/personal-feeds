An homage and loving look back at the earliest days of Industrial Light and Magic. I don’t want to say much more than that lest I spoil the wonder of it. I don’t know why anyone would exert so much effort to make something like this but I’m so inordinately delighted that Sumi did. It speaks to the power of obsession.</p>\n\n<p>After you watch it, take a look at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kyabetsumade/status/1729065249092022416\">this tweet from Sumi</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IENfT3qacKY\">this prototype rendering</a> from three years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Just amazing. So much obvious love.
