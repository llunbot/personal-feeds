Cisco and researchers have known since last week that a ransomware crime syndicate called Akira was gaining access to devices through password spraying and brute-forcing. Password spraying, also known as credential stuffing, involves trying a handful of commonly used passwords for a large number of usernames in an attempt to prevent detection and subsequent lockouts. In brute-force attacks, hackers use a much larger corpus of password guesses against a more limited number of usernames.</p>\n<h2>Ongoing attacks since (at least) March</h2>\n<p>“An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials,” Cisco officials wrote in an <a href=\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ravpn-auth-8LyfCkeC#fs\">advisory</a>. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966724#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966724&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5845737ce4fe3b061b643d1062a679655a28e91427165a40251e642295dd9d08","category":"Tech"}
