Here's everything Double Tap can do, and how you can make the most of it on your Apple Watch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/double-tap.jpeg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nDouble Tap is a gesture-based feature for Apple Watch models that lets you control watch functions by tapping your thumb and index finger together twice. The feature aims to make it easier to navigate the Apple Watch when you have only one hand free, like when you're walking a dog, carrying groceries, or holding a cup of coffee.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>What Double Tap Can Do</h2>\r<br />\nDouble Tap's functionality is pretty simple. You raise your watch to wake, and then you double tap your thumb and index finger together to control what's happening on the screen of your watch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBy default, Double Tap selects the primary button in whatever app you're in. So for example, if you get a call, you can double tap to answer, and use it to hang up when you're done. Likewise, if you're watching/listening to media, you can pause it and resume it (or skip). You can also use the gesture from your Apple Watch face to navigate through your Smart Stack, widget by widget.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome other use cases: If you've set a timer, double-tapping will pause it. Performing the gesture again will resume the countdown, and when the timer goes off, a double-tap will stop it. Similarly, you can use it to do other everyday things like snooze alarms, trigger the Camera Remote app's shutter button, and dismiss notifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-watchos-11-double-tap.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"396\" />\r<br />\nAs you might expect, the gesture is also set up to assume your other hand is preoccupied. If you receive a text, for instance, a double tap lets you reply with a voice message, while another double tap sends the message.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere's a rundown of everything you can do with Double Tap:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and then Double Tap again to scroll through widgets one by one.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Answer phone or FaceTime calls.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Hang up phone or FaceTime calls.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>When you get an iMessage, Double Tap to view it, and then Double Tap again if you need to scroll.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Reply to a Message using dictation and then send it with Double Tap.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Act on notifications - Apple says a Double Tap on an incoming notification will activate the primary action, such as snoozing a reminder or replying to a message.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Pause, resume, and end a timer.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Stop and resume the stopwatch.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Snooze an alarm.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Play and pause music, podcasts, or audiobooks (or skip a track, depending on settings).</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Change to the Elevation view in the Compass app.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Start or stop automatic Workout reminders when a workout is detected.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Take a photo with the Camera Remote.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Record a voice memo in the Voice Memo app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Change Flashlight modes.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nIn the Apple Watch Settings app, under Gestures, you can opt to change the playback option from play/pause to skip, and the Smart Stack option from Advance (swaps through the widgets) to Select (opens a widget's associated app). If you have Apple Vision Pro, you'll also find an option to ignore double tap gestures when you're wearing the headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>How to Set Up Double Tap</h2>\r<br />\nDouble Tap is disabled by default, so you will need to enable it manually for it to work. This can be done from your wrist or in the Watch app on iPhone, and both menus include options to customize Media Playback and Smart Stack functionality. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that to enable Double Tap, setup involves giving watchOS permission to disable some Accessibility options, including Assistive Touch, Zoom with Hand Gestures, VoiceOver with Hand Gestures, and Quick Actions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>On Apple Watch:</h3>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li>\r<br />\n<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> at the bottom of the on-screen alert.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Choose your preferred setting for \"Playback\" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and \"Smart Stack\" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap2.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1920\" height=\"940\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>On iPhone:</h3>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Watch</strong> app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>With the \"My Watch\" tab selected, tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li>\r<br />\n<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> in the on-screen alert.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Choose your preferred setting for \"Playback\" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and \"Smart Stack\" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap1.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says Double Tap is enabled by the S9 chip's faster Neural Engine, which is why the feature is only available on the Series 9 and later and the Ultra 2. Apple said it developed an algorithm that detects the \"unique signature\" of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb are tapped together.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/\">How to Use Hand Gestures to Control Your Apple Watch</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nIf you own an earlier Apple Watch model that doesn't support Double Tap, you can always try a similar but more limited accessibility feature called <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/\">AssistiveTouch</a>, which is available on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/double-tap/\">Double Tap</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/using-the-double-tap-feature-on-apple-watch/\">Do More Single-Handedly With Double Tap on Apple Watch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/do-more-single-handedly-with-double-tap-on-apple-watch.2444105/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cf5310d601ccb1f14e30f0f7a42329e0ca178024a5c67d3cc13c24926864f73f","category":"Apple"}
