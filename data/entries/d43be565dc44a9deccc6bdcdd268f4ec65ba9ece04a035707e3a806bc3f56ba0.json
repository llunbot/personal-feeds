Apple Watch repairs typically involve replacing a broken unit with a new model rather than fixing an individual component, and replacement devices will not be available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/apple-watch-ultra-yellow.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple shared the news with retail employees in a memo that was sent out this week. Portions of the memo were seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, and it was also shared by <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-21/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-ban-means-no-repairs-on-out-of-warranty-models\">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple is set to stop all U.S. online sales of the Apple Watch in just a few hours, with in-store sales to cease after December 24.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Product replacement (CRU) programs aren't available in the United States for the watches below: Apple Watch Series 6 or later, Apple Watch Ultra or later,\" reads the memo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple cannot provide replacements for any out-of-warranty Apple Watch with a blood oxygen sensor, which includes the Apple Watch Series 6 and later and the original Apple Watch Ultra. Customers who damage their Apple Watch will need to wait on repairs until hardware replacements are available again. Software-based repairs will remain available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Watch models that are under warranty are allowed to be replaced. This includes both the standard one-year warranty for new devices and devices protected through an extended <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a> warranty.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCustomers will not be able to exchange an Apple Watch after the ban comes into effect, but accessories like bands can be replaced and returns will be accepted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe United States International Trade Commission is putting a stop to imports of Apple Watches with blood oxygen sensing technology, which means Apple cannot bring them to the United States from overseas where they are manufactured. The ITC in October said that Apple infringed on blood oxygen patents owned by medical device company Masimo, and set the ban for December 25.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could avoid a pause in sales if the White House steps in and vetoes the ban, but that has not happened as of yet. The White House has until December 25 to make a decision.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther options include settling the dispute with Masimo, which would involve Apple having to pay Masimo to license the patent technology, or removing the infringing technology. Apple is working on a software fix for the Apple Watch blood oxygen sensing algorithm that it believes will be sufficient to get the Apple Watch back on store shelves.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple has to stop selling the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a> will remain available. Third-party retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart will also be able to continue sales of all Apple Watch models while supplies last.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itc/\">ITC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-import-ban-repair-issue/\">Apple Won't Be Able to Repair Out-of-Warranty Apple Watches Due to Import Ban</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wont-be-able-to-repair-out-of-warranty-apple-watches-due-to-import-ban.2414359/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d43be565dc44a9deccc6bdcdd268f4ec65ba9ece04a035707e3a806bc3f56ba0","category":"Apple"}
