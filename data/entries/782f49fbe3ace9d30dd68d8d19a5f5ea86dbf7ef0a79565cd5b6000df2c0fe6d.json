There are lots of discounted products and deals—some of them good, some of them no better than you would find the rest of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a new iPhone you may be wondering if the iPhone will be on sale for Prime Day. The answer to this question depends on where you are based. If you’re in the U.S., Amazon is not the place to go to buy a new iPhone, however, in other countries, including the U.K., you will find the latest iPhones at Amazon at lower prices than Apple sells them for. iPhone deals are available year-round, but it isn’t usually until <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/prime-day\">Prime Day</a> that the deals are better at Amazon than from carriers and other retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K., you can find the latest iPhones unlocked at Amazon and at other resellers. Supplies can be limited, and there are usually only small discounts for the newest handsets, but you might see some good deals on the older iPhone models such as the iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone SE. You can see current deals on various iPhones below. If you aren’t sure which iPhone to buy take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670458/iphone-buying-guide.html\">iPhone buying guide</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">comparison of every iPhone handset</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>First published on Friday, July 12.

Prime memberships cost <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree\">$139</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree\">£95</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/tryprimefree\">AUD$59</a> annually, or $14.99 / £8.99 / AUD$6.99 every month. New users can sign up for a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree\" target=\"_blank\">30-day free trial</a> that can be canceled at any time during the trial window. You’ll also get free one or two-day delivery and access to Amazon Prime Video and all that content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One tip when you click on a good deal—even if it’s from a Macworld page—is to check that the product isn’t redirected to a refurbished model, and the current manufacturer’s price is listed, as that can make the price drop look a lot better than it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prime Day 2024: Our favorite deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been tracking iPhone deals for years and know a good one when we see it.
