If I now use command-tab to move Mozilla to the background, the little yellow box stays there, in the foreground. The only way to get rid of it is to put mozilla in the foreground again, and move the mouse off the toolbar,\" Price wrote on June 2. There were a few other bugs related to this issue, but Price set down a reproducible issue, confirmed by many others in the weeks to come—and months to come, years to come, and more than two decades to come.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"Firefox tooltip lingering over an Applications window in Mac OS X, captured 12 years ago.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tooltip2.jpg\" /><p>Firefox tooltip lingering over an Applications window in Mac OS X, captured 12 years ago.

It would occasionally seem fixed, only for coders and commenters to discover that it was just a little <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148624#c31\">different in different versions</a> or that prior fixes were seemingly accidental. Sometimes it seemed to appear in Windows or Linux, too. One commenter, denis, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148624#c42\">noted that at the 21-year mark</a>: \"I'm kinda partial to let it be forever. It feels like a relic from the past.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974726#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df5a4608ae5d9cd1b5490866ddb112c19ecfaf96cd9f5e8d8914c66ddefe4601","category":"Tech"}
