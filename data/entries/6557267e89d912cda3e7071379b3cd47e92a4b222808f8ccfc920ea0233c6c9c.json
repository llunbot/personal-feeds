When I started building in 2012, 29 x 2.4” tire clearance was prerequisite, and 420mm chainstays were all the rage. Luckily, the hardtail expectations of the era lent themselves well to the type of riding we have close by here in Santa Barbara: steep, rocky climbs right out the gate with chunky, twisty descents on the way back down. Fine-tuning our hardtail became a bit of an obsession. Stinner was still mostly known as a road brand, probably because of my road “racing” background, and most of the connections I had at a “professional” level were connected with the road scene. But, much of my personal riding happens on dirt in the foothills of Santa Barbara, and the original Tunnel was a reflection of those surroundings.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-51.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-56.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Hardtails have taken many forms in the last ten years. Along with shifting geometries, most of those iterations have revolved around tire sizes and chain line being all over the place. You name it, the industry has tried it; our original 29 x 2.4″ might seem quaint by some of today’s plus-tired peers. Customers frequently ask for the latest-and-greatest and want what they believe to be the next hot thing. As a small builder, it can be easy to get caught up in trends but I never bit on any of those requests. I always felt a 29 x 2.4 or 2.5 with 140mm of front travel rode best for our trails, so why change? Well, a decade after the Tunnel was first introduced and we thought it might be time after all for a design update to this enduring hardtail. As it turns out, what was old can be new again.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Tunnel Updates Put to the Test</h3>\n<p>Since we had already changed the Tunnel’s rear spacing to boost spec we were able to bump up our tire size to 29 x 2.6″ and take the chainstays out to 430mm without any issues. With these subtle but impactful changes implemented, we feel like we have settled on what we think, geometry-wise, is the best hardtail.</p>\n<p>People often ask how we can thrive and grow in an environment where only the wealthiest survive. Well, the answer is our community. There is a saying in Santa Barbara: Trust in the bubble, and the bubble provides. The three dudes below exemplify how our community keeps us going along with the versatility of the Tunnel. Each has a different riding background but was looking for the same thing: a fun, playful hardtail to shred around Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-57.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Each of these dudes plays an important role in the little bicycle ecosystem we live in. Tosh has been a huge part of where Stinner is today! Long drives, long rides, photos, and a billion cups of coffee. He has been there for us through the best of times and the worst of times. Last year, when the tenant we were sharing shop space with bailed at the last minute, Brian walked into our shop through a mutual friend. Within a few minutes, we both knew the fit was right. Thirty days later, Brian was sharing a shop with us. Now, we can’t imagine sharing a shop with anyone else.</p>\n<p>As for Jim Bob, he needs little introduction. Jim grew up with Tosh and was good friends with Brian, so it was only natural that our paths would cross. Jim has become a great ambassador for riding in and around Santa Barbara. His drive to build a better community is why the Santa Barbara riding scene exists in the first place. He is one of those guys that makes sure the bubble provides, and for that, we are thankful. All three of these bikes have wild paint jobs (don’t ask us to repeat them) and each bike serves a moment in time for each Brian, Tosh, and Jim Bob because we felt they deserved something truly unique. Each bike represents them and what they are giving back to our community.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Stinner-Radavist-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Brian’s Stinner Tunnel</strong></p>\n<p><em>“It’s like riding a unicorn through a field of rainbows.

Although I must admit this is the only bike I’m worried about laying down because the paint job is so special to me. It’s like a work of art. James truly brought a dream into a reality.
