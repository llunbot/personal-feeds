{"title":"New – Amazon EC2 M6a Instances Powered By 3rd Gen AMD EPYC Processors","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-m6a-instances-powered-by-3rd-gen-amd-epyc-processors/","date":1638204479000,"content":"<p>AWS and AMD have collaborated to give customers more choice and value in cloud computing, starting with the first generation AMD EPYC<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" /> processors in 2018 such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-lower-cost-amd-powered-ec2-instances/\">M5a/R5a</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amd-epyc-powered-amazon-ec2-m5ad-and-r5ad-instances/\">M5ad/R5ad</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-amd-epyc-powered-amazon-ec2-t3a-instances\">T3a instances</a>. In 2020, we expanded the second generation AMD EPYC<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" /> processors to include <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-c5a-instances-powered-by-2nd-gen-amd-epyc-processors/\">C5a/C5ad instances</a> and recently <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-g4ad-instances-featuring-amd-gpus-for-graphics-workloads/\">G4ad instances,</a> combining the power of both second-generation AMD EPYC<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" /> processors and AMD Radeon Pro GPUs.</p> \n<p>Today, I am happy to announce the general availability of <strong>Amazon EC2 M6a instances</strong> featuring the 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, running at frequencies up to 3.6 GHz to offer up to 35 percent price performance versus the previous generation M5a instances.</p> \n<p>You can launch M6a instances today in ten sizes in the AWS US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and Europe (Ireland) Regions as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/\">On-Demand</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/\">Spot</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/\">Reserved Instance</a> or as part of a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/\">Savings Plan</a>.

M6a also offers <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/\">Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)</a> support for workloads that benefit from lower network latency and highly scalable inter-node communication, such as HPC and video processing.</li> \n <li>Up to <strong>35 percent</strong> higher price performance per vCPU versus comparable M5a instances, up to <strong>50 Gbps</strong> of networking speed, and up to <strong>40 Gbps</strong> bandwidth of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/?ebs-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;ebs-whats-new.sort-order=desc\">Amazon EBS</a>, more than twice that of M5a instances.</li> \n <li>Always-on memory encryption and support for new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions\">AVX2 instructions</a> for accelerating encryption and decryption algorithms</li> \n</ul> \n<p>M6a instances expand the 6th generation general purpose instances portfolio and provide high-performance processing at 10 percent lower cost over comparable x86 instances. M6a instances are a good fit for running general-purpose workloads such as web servers,  application servers, and small data stores.</p> \n<p>To learn more, visit the M6a instances page.
