Goodyear designed this one as a “fast and agile tread” meant to combine cross-country climbing and rolling speed with increased descending confidence. The Inter looks closer to Goodyear’s Peak XC tire, while getting two-stage shoulder blocks for confident grip in soft corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Featuring a rounded profile with a tightly spaced 4 / 3 tread block configuration, promoting high rolling speeds and predictable handling. Ramped center blocks keep rolling speeds high with ‘In Block’ cornering blocks delivering predictable cornering bite.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max.webp\" alt=\"Goodyear Escape Max trail mountain bike tire, on front \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_Escape-Max-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Escape Max is a clearly more aggressive tread pattern with a more boxy shape and tall blocky should knobs for grip in soft terrain. It features a more open design to shed mud and dig deep for grip in loamy trails. It looks more like their Wrangler enduro treads, but with ramped blocks to make it faster rolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Designed to keep rolling efficiency high on the climbs, with large side blocks featuring ‘In Block’ sipes to provide bite and cornering confidence. Utilizing a staggered 3 / 2 / 2 center block pattern for rolling efficiency, braking performance, and a predictable transition from center to cornering blocks.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2 Trail Casings: Trail Lite &amp; Trail Plus</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1621\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Goodyear Escape Inter &amp; Max trail mountain bike tires, lightweight casing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-297x188.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-1536x973.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-120x76.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-768x486.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Lite-casing-2048x1297.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Goodyear is trying to simplify with two new 60tpi tubeless casings for the new trail tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trail Lite is the lighter-weight version with simple bead protection, casing overlap under the tread to resist punctures, and a lightweight extra layer of sidewall protection. It is meant to be “supple and reliable” with just enough protection to resist cuts and punctures in everyday trail riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1621\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Goodyear Escape Inter &amp; Max trail mountain bike tires, Trail Plus reinforced casing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-297x188.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-1536x973.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-120x76.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-768x486.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Max-trail-mountain-bike-tires_Trail-Plus-casing-2048x1297.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Trail Plus then takes it a couple of steps further. This mid-weight casing adds butyl anti-pinch flat inserts that extend from the bead halfway up the sidewall.  And it replaces the light sidewall protection layer with a tougher bead-to-bead reinforcement fabric for extra protection and sidewall support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those extra layers add 145-160g of protection, going from Trail Lite to Plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Rubber Compounds: UHP, Grip 2 &amp; Grip 3</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds.webp\" alt=\"Goodyear Escape Inter &amp; Max trail mountain bike tires, new rubber compounds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/all-new-Goodyear-Escape-Inter-and-Escape-Max-are-more-versatile-trail-bike-tires_new-rubber-compounds-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, three rubber compounds round out your choices. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>UHP is Goodyear’s ‘ultra high performance’ fastest rolling and most durable compound – the same 60a rubber used in their road range and teased for some next-gen gravel tires, too.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grip2 is a versatile dual compound 50/60 rubber that keeps the fast rolling center but makes the shoulder cornering knobs softer. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grip3 then is the stickiest of all.
