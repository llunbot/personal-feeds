It was beefy and interesting, but it had three major flaws: It ran Windows on a little touchscreen, had unremarkable ergonomics, and its battery life was painful.</p>\n<p>The Asus ROG (Republic of Gamers) Ally X, which has been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vze62qJK1Sk\">announced</a> and is due out June 2, seems to have had its specs leaked, and they indicate a fix for at least the battery life.
