I still have to use an app to fix it automatically. The app is from 2015, that means we are approaching the 10 year anniversary [of the bug].\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/balance_lock/\">Balance Lock</a> is the app in question, a free download available from Tunabelly Software. The bug's continuing existence was corroborated by other users who responded to the X post and commented on it over on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39367460\">Hacker News</a>. However, it seems as though the issue has persisted for even longer than Fabian initially supposed. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWriting in 2013 on <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/79384/audio-balance-changes-randomly-in-macbook-pro-retina-15-inch-mid-2012\">Stack Exchange</a>, one user claimed to have experienced the same bug on multiple Macs going back to 2003. Whether or not that is the case, what we do know is that Apple acknowledged the bug on February 12, 2012 in a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230419150423/https://support.apple.com/kb/TA22305?locale=nl_BE\">Mac OS X 10.2 support document</a>, which is no longer on Apple's website but retrievable via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. In it Apple states: \r<br />\n<blockquote>In some cases the audio balance may unexpectedly drift towards the left or right channel. This can happen if you rapidly press the volume up or down keys while the computer's microprocessor is under heavy load.</blockquote>To rectify the problem, Apple advises users to open the Sound panel in System Preferences (now System Settings) and \"Drag the audio balance slider to the desired position.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>The year is 2024 and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@apple</a> still has not fixed the audio left/right balance bug in MacOS. I still have to use an app to fix it automatically.
