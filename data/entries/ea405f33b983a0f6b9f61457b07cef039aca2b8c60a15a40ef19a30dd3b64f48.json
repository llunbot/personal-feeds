Gladys Verhulst (Team Arkéa) won the sprint from a reduced peloton and Kristen Faulkner (Tibco-SVB) finished third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alena Amialiusik (Canyon-SRAM) and Jade Wiel (FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope) spent most of the race off the front, until the final three laps when the peloton started to fight amongst each other. There were a few splits in the peloton, with many riders losing contact from the main group, but the real selection happened with 25 km to go when Longo Borghini attacked on the Bosse du Lezot climb. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Mavi García (Alé BTC Ljubljana) joined Longo Borghini and the two bridged to Amialusik who had dropped Wiel. As the race approached the final lap the front group swelled to include riders from all the major teams. With one lap of the hilly circuit remaining the attacks started as the group passed the start/finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again splits impacted the race on Bosse du Lezot and a group of four emerged, and once again Longo Borghini made her way off the front of the race. Longo Borghini’s lead on the much-reduced peloton was hardly able to clock a time, but as the kilometres ticked by the Italian national champion refused to let up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the peloton, attacks impacted the chase with only Floortje Mackaij (Team DSM) separating herself from the peloton. Unable to catch Longo Borghini, Mackaij found herself trapped between the leader and the rest of the race. Mackaij was eventually caught by the remaining peloton and the rest of the podium came down to a sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n    <div>\n\t\t            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGP de Plouay - Lorient- Agglomération Trophée CERATIZIT (1.WWT)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <span>Plouay → Plouay</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=256595\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                        <img />\n\t\t\t\t\t                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">LONGO BORGHINI Elisa</a>\n                                            <span>Trek-Segafredo Women </span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">VERHULST Gladys</a>\n                                            <span>Team Arkéa</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>3</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">FAULKNER Kristen</a>\n                                            <span>Team TIBCO - SVB</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <a href=\"/race-result?race=256595\">Full results →</a>\n                </div>\n\t\t\t\t            </div>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/elisa-longo-borghini-is-back-on-the-top-step-at-gp-de-plouay/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ea405f33b983a0f6b9f61457b07cef039aca2b8c60a15a40ef19a30dd3b64f48","category":"Cycling"}
