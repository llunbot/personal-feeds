But no matter which one you want, you can save big today at Amazon. Here are the sale prices:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods Pro (2nd-gen)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHWDR12?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$200 (all-time low)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $49</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why we love em:</strong> The new 2nd-gen AirPods Pro look the same as the previous model, but they’re all-new on the inside, with 2X better noise cancellation, longer battery life, and better quality, and a new Adaptive Transparency mode that automatically blocks out harmful noises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods (3rd-gen with Lightning case)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$150</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $19</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why we love em:</strong> Apple’s 3rd-gen AirPods bring several upgrades over the 2nd-gen model, including personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, sweat and water resistance, adaptive EQ, and most importantly, longer battery life. They also have a slightly refined design with touch controls. Note: This model doesn’t have a wireless charging case and needs to be plugged in with a Lightning cable to charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods (2nd-gen)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$99</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $30</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Why we love em:</strong> </strong>Apple’s older AirPods are missing several of the features found in the 3rd-gen model, but they’re still fantastic earbuds, especially when you can get them for under $100.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$479 (all colors)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $70</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why we love em:</strong> The over-ear AirPods Max are Apple’s highest-end headphones that have a striking design featuring magnetic ear cups and a soft mesh headband available in five colors. And the sound quality is just as striking, with noise cancelation, Spatial Audio, and an Apple-designed dynamic driver that delivers a wide frequency range.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"26ebffd302bba81e1d178323959a81e07721111beffc4327c1889c90fe6c0f8d","category":"Apple"}
