GRE stands for \"Golden Rabbit Edition,\" a reference to the Chinese zodiac, and while the card was available outside of China in a handful of pre-built OEM systems, AMD didn't make it widely available at retail.</p>\n\n<p>That changes today—AMD is launching the RX 7900 GRE at US retail for a suggested starting price of $549. This throws it right into the middle of the busy upper-mid-range graphics card market, where it will compete with Nvidia's $549 RTX 4070 and the $599 RTX 4070 Super, as well as AMD's own $500 Radeon RX 7800 XT.</p>\n<p>We've run our typical set of GPU tests on the 7900 GRE to see how it stacks up to the cards AMD and Nvidia are already offering. Is it worth buying a new card relatively late in this GPU generation, when rumors point to new next-gen GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel before the end of the year? Can the \"Golden Rabbit Edition\" still offer a good value, even though it's currently the year of the dragon?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003298#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003298&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14e23bfb0216404cbd65e5f47c052d2b185f9ab5ebc10db1148938fbfe73f4f5","category":"Tech"}
