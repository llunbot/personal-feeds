Dubbed the Tube, the wind tunnel is being used for MET’s testing and development. The first major release from this venture is the Drone Wide Body II time trial helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineered specifically for cycling aerodynamic and thermal analysis<em>, </em>MET’s proprietary wind tunnel is a state-of-the-art facility<em> </em>for testing helmets<em>, </em>bikes<em>, </em>rider positions<em>, </em>and any other aero equipment<em>.</em> According to MET, testing different shapes and configurations is key to finding the perfect balance for a variety of riders’ bodies and positions. Thanks to in-house 3D printers, MET can evaluate multiple solutions in the Tube and fine-tune the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5.webp\" alt=\"Monitors display data as a rider tests inside the MET wind tunnel.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-aero-testing-5-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>There’s looking fast, then there’s actually testing fast. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MET developed the Tube to conduct two modes of testing, one using just the headform to analyze the aerodynamics of a helmet on its own, and another holistic testing setup with the bike and rider. This allows MET to evaluate not only the helmet shape but also how the helmet interacts with the rider and the whole system of rider and bike. The Tube is the latest addition to MET’s Italian HQ in Talamona, completing what is now the most advanced helmet development facility in the world. This includes a crash test laboratory, FEM virtual analysis, 3D prototyping, and now an aerodynamic and thermal wind tunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is thermal wind tunnel testing? The Tube is equipped with a headform that integrates thermal sensors around its entire crown. The headform is heated to 38°C, which simulates the temperature of the body under strain. MET engineers measure the temperature decrease over time to test air flow; the faster it decreases, the more effectively the internal air channeling is functioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10.webp\" alt=\"A rider sits inside the turbine of the thermal wind tunnel at MET HQ.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-tube-wind-tunnel-10-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>Thermal wind tunnel testing measures heat dissipation from 38 °C to test air flow efficiency.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to MET, “the Drone Wide Body II is the second generation of the helmet that has won multiple World Tour Time Trials and Ironman World Championships. A new tail design, developed in our in-house wind tunnel, helps the new Drone II be 13.5 seconds faster over a 40 km time trial than the previous version. The linear tail design allows for a lower head position while riding.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1257\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-drone-wide-body-II-aero-cycling-helmet-new-tail-design.webp\" alt=\"The new tail design of the Drone II Widebody TT helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-drone-wide-body-II-aero-cycling-helmet-new-tail-design.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-drone-wide-body-II-aero-cycling-helmet-new-tail-design-297x187.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-drone-wide-body-II-aero-cycling-helmet-new-tail-design-1536x965.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-drone-wide-body-II-aero-cycling-helmet-new-tail-design-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/met-drone-wide-body-II-aero-cycling-helmet-new-tail-design-768x483.webp 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MET Drone’s unique wide body design channels airflow over the shoulders, significantly reducing turbulence and drag. This results in valuable energy savings and an aerodynamic advantage for the rider. The low drag inlets are strategically positioned to reduce air turbulence and are working with an internal air channeling system to improve ventilation and comfort. With 430g, it’s among the lightest long-tail helmets on the market, offering superior comfort on a long-distance Ironman race.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2304\" height=\"1490\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TADEJATUAE2025-scaled-e1746071683759.webp\" alt=\"Tadej Pogacar wore the Drone II Widebody at the 2025 UAE Tour\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TADEJATUAE2025-scaled-e1746071683759.webp 2304w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TADEJATUAE2025-scaled-e1746071683759-297x192.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TADEJATUAE2025-scaled-e1746071683759-1536x993.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TADEJATUAE2025-scaled-e1746071683759-120x78.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TADEJATUAE2025-scaled-e1746071683759-768x497.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TADEJATUAE2025-scaled-e1746071683759-2048x1324.webp 2048w\" /><figcaption>Tadej Pogacar using the MET Drone Wide Body II at the 2025 UAE Tour, where he placed 3rd in the ITT. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight is 430g for both sizes, medium and large, which measure 55-58 and 58-61cm, respectively.
