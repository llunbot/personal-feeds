The protruding ends of the top tube each include a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">bike light</a>, while an LED array in the top tube gives you status information and navigation. It even includes geolocation, tracking, immobilisation and an alarm.</p>\n<p>The X3’s lowered top tube makes for a more compact design than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/vanmoof-s3-review/\">Van Moof S3</a>, which we’ve also reviewed. It comes in one size to fit riders from 5ft to 6ft5in. The ride position is upright and the steering feels light and fast, making for easy manoeuvrability.

When there is a brand name associated with the system, it’s often a less well-known OEM brand.</p>\n<p>You’ll also find units from Bafang, which is well-respected for its lower-priced motors. Electric bike motors from brands such as Shimano, Bosch and Fazua are in the main reserved for many of the more expensive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">best electric bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Many cheap electric bikes will have rear-hub motors, although you can find models with mid-mounted motors as well. These make for more even weight distribution, but because the power is delivered through the drivetrain, there may be more wear on components.</p>\n<p>You’ll occasionally see a front-hub motor, but these are more common in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bike-conversion-kits/\">best electric bike conversion kits</a>.</p>\n<h3>Budget eclectic bike range and battery life explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"A Powerpack 400 battery powers the Bosch Active line plus motor\" title=\"Carrera Crossfuse 06\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A non-integrated battery may look ugly, but it’s easy to take indoors for charging.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One of the most expensive components of an electric bike motor system is the battery.</p>\n<p>This means cheaper electric bikes will often hit a lower price point by speccing a smaller-capacity battery. This may limit range, although you should still have plenty to get you around town. Longer excursions over hillier terrain may be out of the question, however.</p>\n<p>Also look at recharge time, which can be prolonged for some cheaper systems.</p>\n<p>Many cheap ebikes will have a battery mounted on the down tube or under a rear rack, rather than integrated into the frame. It may not be pretty, but it means it’s easy to remove the battery for charging indoors. Make sure it’s lockable to the bike though.</p>\n<h3>Budget eclectic bike components explained</h3>\n<p>A cheap electric bike may have lower-spec components too. That’s particularly evident in the drivetrain, where cheaper components are usually specced.</p>\n<p>They’ll work perfectly well, but may not give you the gear range to tackle steeper climbs, although the motor will certainly help out here.</p>\n<p>Some budget electric bikes will have a single-speed drivetrain, which can limit hill-climbing ability and also top speed at the other end of the range.</p>\n<p>Also make sure the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-to-choose-the-best-saddle/\">saddle</a> is comfortable and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/\">tyres</a> of reasonable quality, although both of these are components that are easy to swap out.</p>\n<h3>Extras</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brompton P Line folding bike\" title=\"Brompton P Line - 18\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Budget for mudguards if you plan to ride in all weathers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you are going to be using your electric bike for commuting or other duties in all weathers, you will probably want to fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a>.
