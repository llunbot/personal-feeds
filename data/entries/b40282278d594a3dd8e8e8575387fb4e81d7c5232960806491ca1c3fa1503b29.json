Apple says reducing the time that a battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/118418\">support document</a>:\r<br />\n<blockquote>Reducing the time that your iPad spends fully charged reduces the wear on your battery. With iPad Pro (M4) and iPad Air (M2), you can choose to limit charging at 80 percent, which can help prolong your battery's lifespan. When you choose 80% Limit, your iPad will charge up to about 80 percent and then stop charging. If the battery charge level gets down to 75 percent, charging will resume until your battery charge level reaches about 80 percent again.</blockquote><h2>How to Set an 80% iPad Battery Charge Limit</h2>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your M4 ‌iPad Pro‌ or ‌M2‌ ‌iPad Air‌.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Battery ➝ Battery Health</strong>.\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap the switch next to <strong>80% Limit</strong> to turn on the feature.</li>\r<br />\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/battery-charge-limit-ipad.jpeg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"2752\" height=\"2064\" />Note that from the new Battery Health settings menu you can also view the manufacture date of your ‌iPad‌'s battery, as well as the month and year on which it was first used.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn M4 ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌M2‌ ‌iPad Air‌ models, you can also find out the cycle count of your device's battery.
