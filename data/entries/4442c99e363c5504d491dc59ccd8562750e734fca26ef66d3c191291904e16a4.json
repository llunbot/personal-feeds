They’re a great company with a great product.</p>\n\n<p>Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies that use Okta. Kolide’s unique approach works with Okta to make device compliance part of the authentication process. If a device isn’t compliant, users can’t log in to their cloud apps until they’ve fixed the problem. And instead of creating more work for your IT team, Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.</p>\n\n<p>Kolide works across your Mac, Windows, and even Linux devices, with mobile support coming soon. <a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3XlSqAq\">Visit Kolide’s website</a> to learn more and see it in action.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/18/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4442c99e363c5504d491dc59ccd8562750e734fca26ef66d3c191291904e16a4","category":"Tech"}"siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4442c99e363c5504d491dc59ccd8562750e734fca26ef66d3c191291904e16a4","category":"Tech"}
