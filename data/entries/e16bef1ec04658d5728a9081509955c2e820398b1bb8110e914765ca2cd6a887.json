Peak HDR brightness will apparently remain the same at 1,600 nits.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro touted a significant increase in brightness over its predecessor, featuring up to 400 nits higher HDR brightness. However, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s typical SDR brightness has been the same at 1,000 nits since the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> Pro in 2021. The ‌iPhone‌'s typical SDR is used in the majority of situations, so a 20% increase in standard brightness would be a significant upgrade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a mixed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">track record for Apple rumors</a>, but has provided some strikingly accurate information, such as the imminent launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">2023's Yellow iPhone 14</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/\">frosted back glass</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/\">as a minor refresh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/\">spatial video capture</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/\">landscape front-facing camera</a>, and the ‌iPad Pro‌'s new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/\">nano-texture display option</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to launch as usual in the fall, with the Pro models featuring larger displays, an all-new \"Capture\" button, the A18 chip, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">Instant Digital</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/iphone-16-pro-brighter-display/\">iPhone 16 Pro Rumored to Feature 20% Brighter Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-rumored-to-feature-20-brighter-display.2425965/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e16bef1ec04658d5728a9081509955c2e820398b1bb8110e914765ca2cd6a887","category":"Apple"}
