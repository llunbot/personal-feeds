More performance, a bigger battery, more ports, a larger screen…if you need more, you need a 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you spend all that money on something you hope to keep and use for years, it’s worth asking if this is a good time to buy. In the world of computers, there’s always something better on the way, but if it’s a <em>lot</em> better and it’s coming <em>soon</em>, you might want to wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Pros got a huge update in 2021, with improvements to the display, ports, and overall design. In January 2023 they were updated again, with new M2 Pro and M2 Max processors, HDMI 2.1, Wi-Fi 6E, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 10/31/23:</strong> With the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros just upgraded to M3 processors, this is a good time to buy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro: Pricing and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Released: </strong>October 2023</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro were upgraded in October of 2023 (with shipping in early November). You can now get the 14-inch model with an M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max, and the 16-inch model with an M3 Pro or M3 Max.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14-inch MacBook Pro (M3, 2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" alt=\"14-inch MacBook Pro (M3, 2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/14-inch-M3-MacBook-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-354078-6-2121023-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-m3\" target=\"_blank\">$1599 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t16-inch MacBook Pro (M3 Pro, 2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" alt=\"16-inch MacBook Pro (M3 Pro, 2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/16-inch-macbook-pro-space-gray-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$2,499\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-354078-6-2121048-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-m3-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$2499 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,599. The 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,499. There are processor, RAM, and storage options that can push it over $6,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro: Why you should buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Pro is a tremendous machine that checks off nearly every box on a pro user’s wishlist. It’s fast, capable, and powerful, and brings Apple’s pro laptop into the forefront of the pack. After receiving huge upgrades to the display and design in 2021, the latest model upgrades the processor to the faster M3 Pro and M2 Max, and you can even get the 14-inch model with a base M3 processor at a new lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, the M3 Pro and M3 Max versions are now available in Space Black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These MacBook Pro models will likely not be updated again until late 2024, at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro: Why you should wait</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you sprang for the M2 Pro/Max model, the new one probably isn’t enough of an upgrade to justify the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As these new M3 models are brand new, there aren’t a lot of discounts yet. If you wait until later in 2024, you might find some decent sales or refurbished models at a reduced price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do decide to make the investment right now, be sure to check our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">best MacBook Pro deals</a> roundup, as you might be able to save some money. The catch with shopping at one of these third-party sales is that customization options are limited, so for example, you have to settle for whatever RAM and SSD configuration is being offered. But if you’re fine with that, you’ll save a lot of cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macworld recommends: BUY</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the MacBook Pro has its M3 upgrade, this is a pretty good time to buy. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro may not be updated again until late 2024. There probably won’t even be any significant sales for at least a few months, so if you want to wait for a big discount you’re going to be waiting a while.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"542452b1f814b4e0ee0f9d6e45c55acafae95ff544d61d48d9408813f4e536a3","category":"Apple"}
