These features include features recently launched on the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-forerunner-965-in-depth-review.html\">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-forerunner-265-265s-review-amoled.html\">Forerunner 265</a>, such as wrist-based Running Dynamics (no longer requiring a separate accessory), and from the FR965 specifically, Training Load Ratio. Remember that Garmin previously noted those are coming to the Forerunner 955 in a beta update as well. Beyond the dozen or so new features, there are also a slate of bug fixes, or simply ‘improvements’ around tweaks to existing features. The line between ‘new feature’ and ‘improvement’ is sometimes a bit blurry.</p>\n<p>As a brief recap about Garmin’s quarterly firmware releases process:</p>\n<p>A) They <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-changes-public-beta-program-for-faster-and-easier-access.html\">start in public beta</a>, which typically lasts anywhere from 3-6 weeks<br />\nB) You have to register your device (free/quick/easy) to get public beta updates.<br />\nC) Garmin usually will make this ‘production’ at roughly the same time down the road<br />\nD) The public beta process is for many products at once, but the timing for each product differs slightly<br />\nE) Not all products receive the same updates</p>\n<p>The other big thing to remember is that this is the first public beta cycle where all WiFi-enabled products will use the in-watch option to force a firmware update for beta-registered. Further, there are no more ‘Alpha’ builds. I <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-changes-public-beta-program-for-faster-and-easier-access.html\">covered these changes last week in this post</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/03/P1088321.jpg\"><img title=\"P1088321\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/03/P1088321_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1088321\" width=\"718\" height=\"481\" /></a></p>\n<p>In any case, with that out of the way, today’s update for the Fenix 7/Epix/Tactix 7/Enduro 2/Quatix 7 units includes the following new features and improvements:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Change log for version 13.09 (changes since v11.28, currently Live):</strong><br />\nAdd more apps/glances to power controls and hot keys.<br />\nAdded 7 day sleep stage graph.<br />\nAdded Apps category to activity/app list add flow.<br />\nAdded calorie burn rate chart to post-activity summary.<br />\nAdded flashlight strobe option to power controls. (Fenix 7X/Tactix 7/Enduro 2 only)<br />\nAdded HRV Status 4-week historical graph.<br />\nAdded HRV status data field to watch faces.<br />\nAdded Load Ratio to Training Status.<br />\nAdded more data field options to the hierarchical data page layout.<br />\nAdded new activity stage landing page.<br />\nAdded Obstacle Course Racing activity.<br />\nAdded Workout Execution Score to post-activity summary.<br />\nAdded Wrist Based Running Dynamics.<br />\nImproved battery estimates when flashlight is used in activity.<br />\nImproved compass smoothness on the compass page.<br />\nImproved Ski activity to now distinguish when you are on lifts versus skiing downhill.<br />\nImprovements to Altitude Acclimation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It also includes the following bug-fixes, although, usually there’s even more bug fixes than those listed here. And obviously, since it’s a beta, it likely includes new bugs too. Think of that like a bonus feature.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fixed Armenian font issue.<br />\nFixed issue that would sometimes show the run timer as negative in Wakesports activities.<br />\nFixed issue where Health Snapshot glance was unable to be added for Quatix watches.<br />\nFixed issue where several Tides menu options wouldn’t appear.<br />\nFixed issue where the max speed of Wakesports activities would sometimes be incorrect.<br />\nFixed issue with custom power modes during activities.<br />\nFixed issue with flashlight cadence mode not showing red flashes.<br />\nFixed issue with Outdoor Maps + deactivation flow.<br />\nFixed issue with Outdoor Maps+ after having cleared settings on the device.<br />\nFixed map only touch setting prompt after a device reboot.<br />\nFixed potential issue where tones would alert when they shouldn’t.<br />\nFixed potential issue with resuming Outdoor Maps+ downloads.<br />\nFixed potential issue with watch face accent color changing from white to something else.<br />\nFixed potential shutdown when clearing smart notifications.<br />\nFixed potential shutdown when viewing fitness age.<br />\nFixed potential shutdown with Drill Start in Pool Swim.<br />\nFixed Recovery Time discrepancy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As for the new features list, virtually all of these have appeared on other devices at some point. For example:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Already launched on Forerunner 965 (and most on FR265 too):</strong><br />\nAdded 7 day sleep stage graph.<br />\nAdded calorie burn rate chart to post-activity summary.<br />\nAdded HRV Status 4-week historical graph.<br />\nAdded HRV status data field to watch faces.<br />\nAdded Load Ratio to Training Status.<br />\nAdded new activity stage landing page.<br />\nAdded Workout Execution Score to post-activity summary.<br />\nAdded Wrist Based Running Dynamics.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those that have already registered your device in the beta program, you can go ahead and download this immediately by going into the settings and doing a ‘Check for Updates” (Menu &gt; System &gt; Software Updates &gt; Check for Updates):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/03/P1088317.jpg\"><img title=\"P1088317\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/03/P1088317_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1088317\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>Further, there’s <a href=\"https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/fenix-7-series/f/announcements/328645/beta-version-13-09---check-for-updates-only---please-see-important-details-in-post\">more information here</a>, including files to revert back to the current production version if you need to. And for those devices, those betas will launch in due time. Just a few weeks ago Fenix owners were all upset that the Forerunner 965 got new features before the Fenix 7/Epix, so now it’s the Forerunner owners’ turn to be upset the Fenix beta launched slightly ahead of the Forerunner side. See, balance of life thing to have everyone upset. Meanwhile, for Fenix 6 owners, obviously, the writing is unfortunately already on the wall there. Albeit, the current <a href=\"https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/fenix-6-series/f/announcement/328663/beta-version-25-77---side-load-only\">beta did add a few new features</a>. However, Instinct 2 owners <a href=\"https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/instinct-2-series/f/announcements/328681/beta-version-12-10---side-load-only\">get some goods here</a>, including Obstacle Course Activity profile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/03/LoadRatio.jpg\"><img title=\"LoadRatio\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/03/LoadRatio_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"LoadRatio\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" /></a></p>\n<p>Finally, as always, note that a beta is just that – beta software. It will have bugs, that’s the point of the beta program – to find those bugs. While it’s generally pretty stable, that’s not always the case. Further, don’t install it on your watch the night before your Ironman race or 18-hour non-stop ride. And always assume that somehow it’s probably going to kill your neighbor’s cat – problem is, you don’t actually know which neighbor. As long as you set those expectations accordingly, you’ll be good.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"bc95ce2385c9183f30a7c815fd59841dee5fcd24e8e02b647e5fef73e3919c4c","category":"Cycling"}
