After nearly six years in development, Yeti felt it was ready to launch its first <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">electric mountain bike</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-yeti-160e/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 Yeti 160E</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-du-ep800-motor/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano’s EP8 motor system</a>, the 160E uses a six-bar linkage design rather than the Switch Infinity link seen on the rest of its full-suspension range. Stay tuned to BikeRadar for a full review in the not too distant future.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, we’ve published reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2021-vitus-escarpe-29-crs-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Vitus Escarpe 29 CRS</a>, where I said it’s a “carbon fibre beauty with no-compromises on kit”.</p>\n<p>Fellow Technical Editor Tom Marvin reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/santa-cruz-blur-xc-x01-axs-rsv-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Santa Cruz Blur XC X01 AXS RSV</a> – a mega-money, lightweight full suspension XC race bike.</p>\n<p>GoPro launched its newest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/gopro-hero-10-black/\">Hero 10 action camera</a> that can shoot 5.3k video and has a lofty price tag of $599.</p>\n<p>We also got a look at Orbea’s new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-orbea-occam/\">2022 Occam</a> trail bike, now coming in two variants. There’s a a shorter travel 140mm bike and a 150mm travel Occam LT that sports a slacker head-tube angle.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a little quieter on the road riding side of the sport, but we’ve published an in-depth article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-train-with-power/\" target=\"_blank\">how to train with power</a> so you know what you need to do to get stronger and faster.</p>\n<p>We’ve also seen the rather pricy <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/muc-off-ludicrous-af/\" target=\"_blank\">Muc-Off Ludicrous AF</a> chain lube that’s claimed to reduce power sapped by drivetrain losses.</p>\n<p>Finally, American Classic is back after a hiatus from the industry since 2018 with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/american-classic-tyres/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel and road tyre collections</a>, now concentrating on rubber rather than rims.
