The software update is expected to be released as early as next week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCustomers are still required to pay Apple's full out-of-warranty fees for any repairs completed prior to purchasing AppleCare+ coverage for the device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn example scenario: A customer named John purchases a new iPhone, but he decides not to pay for AppleCare+ coverage for the device. A few months later, John drops the iPhone and the display is cracked. John takes the iPhone to an Apple Store to be repaired and faces costly out-of-warranty service fees since he decided not to purchase AppleCare+. Since the iPhone is less than one year old, John is advised that he can still purchase AppleCare+ for the device so that any <em>subsequent</em> repairs aren't as expensive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe policy is in effect at Apple Store and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations in all countries and regions where AppleCare+ is available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis expanded AppleCare+ eligibility for repaired iPhones and Macs should further boost Apple's services revenue, which hit a record $18.27 billion last quarter.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/applecare-for-repaired-iphone-mac-devices/\">Apple Giving Customers a Second Chance to Buy AppleCare+ After Their iPhone or Mac is Repaired</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-giving-customers-a-second-chance-to-buy-applecare-after-their-iphone-or-mac-is-repaired.2326701/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GrYxTf0Kkt0:Xd7EmN2lRKg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GrYxTf0Kkt0:Xd7EmN2lRKg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"af85c24064f1101f3b3ff0909ed558714cdb776705580f894b205e7d1aac9c24","category":"Apple"}
