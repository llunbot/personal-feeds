The software update should be released within the next few weeks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iOS-18.3.1-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\niOS 18.3.1 should be a minor update that addresses software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities. Apple Intelligence notification summaries for news and entertainment apps are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/ios-18-3-news-notifications-removed/\">temporarily disabled on iOS 18.3</a> due to issues with inaccurate summaries, but it is unclear if they will be turned back on in iOS 18.3.1, or in a later update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are still waiting for Apple to seed the first iOS 18.4 beta this month. That update is expected to introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/siri-2025-updates/\">several Apple Intelligence enhancements for Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/ios-18-4-beta-coming-soon/\">new emoji</a>, the ability for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/ios-18-4-default-maps-translate-apps-in-eu/\">EU users to set default map and translation apps</a>, and more. Apple's website suggests that iOS 18.4 will be released in April, following beta testing.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/ios-18-3-1-coming-soon/\">iOS 18.3.1 Update Coming Soon for iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-1-update-coming-soon-for-iphones.2448880/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c38248cef339663fd3d41c6c85a57b75c09f8d701afa4490d1ddafd466bfb55e","category":"Apple"}
