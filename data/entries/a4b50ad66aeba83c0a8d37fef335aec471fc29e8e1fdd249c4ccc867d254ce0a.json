It could easily hang in a museum, as if it were a large canvas painting produced by a collaboration of impressionistic and modern artists. But it is very real, showcasing the process of stars being born a mere 390 light years from Earth. This is the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, the closest star-forming region to Earth.</p>\n<p>Given the nursery's proximity and Webb's unparalleled scientific instruments, we have never had this kind of crystal-clear view of these processes before. The detail revealed in this image of about 50 stars is truly remarkable, a distillation of all that Webb has delivered over the last 12 months and all that it promises to do over the next 10 or 20 years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953152#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953152&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a4b50ad66aeba83c0a8d37fef335aec471fc29e8e1fdd249c4ccc867d254ce0a","category":"Tech"}
