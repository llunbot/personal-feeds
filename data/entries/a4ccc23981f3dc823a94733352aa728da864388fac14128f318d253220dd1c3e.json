The streamer ordered 10 episodes.</p>\n<p>The order comes after decades of failed attempts to greenlight a screen adaptation of the 1984 science fiction novel. The most recent widely known failed attempt was by <em>Deadpool</em> director Tim Miller in 2017.</p>\n<p>The series will be helmed by showrunner, writer, and producer Graham Roland, who until now was best known as the creator of the AMC TV series <em>Dark Winds</em> and for helming the series <em>Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan</em> on Amazon Prime Video. Roland will share a co-creator credit on <em>Neuromancer</em> with J.D. Dillard, a TV writer known for his work on the recent<em> Twilight Zone</em> reboot series.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006932#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006932&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a4ccc23981f3dc823a94733352aa728da864388fac14128f318d253220dd1c3e","category":"Tech"}
