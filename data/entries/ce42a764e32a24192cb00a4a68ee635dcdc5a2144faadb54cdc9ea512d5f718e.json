The new Ryzen 9000 chips—the 6-core 9600X, 8-core 9700X, 12-core 9900X, and 16-core 9950X—bring AMD's new Zen 5 architecture to the desktop a couple of weeks after it launched in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/\">the Ryzen AI chips for laptops</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We came away from the cumbersomely named Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 impressed by both its performance and its power efficiency, and AMD is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/amd-makes-improved-efficiency-a-core-part-of-the-pitch-for-its-ryzen-9000-cpus/\">also leaning into power efficiency</a> as a key selling point of the Ryzen 9000 series. Three of the chips have seen their power limits dropped significantly compared to last-gen chips while still bragging of low-double-digit performance increases. That's rare at a time when Intel has been pushing its chips to the edge to squeeze every last bit of performance out of high-end Core i9 and Core i7 chips.</p>\n<p>The focus on power efficiency will give many users—particularly those who don't touch the default settings—less-power-hungry chips that run a bit cooler. And for people who want to tinker and trade in some of that efficiency for a performance boost, many of these chips (particularly the 9700X and 9900X) have a lot of additional performance headroom. It's also nice that all existing AM5 motherboards on the market should be compatible with the 9000 series once a BIOS update is installed, and the AM5 platform's mandatory BIOS Flashback support means you don't need to use weird, kludgy hacks <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/warranty/RMA-BKTC.html\">like the \"boot kit\" CPU loaner program</a> for updating the BIOS when you buy a board with an older BIOS installed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041146#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041146&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce42a764e32a24192cb00a4a68ee635dcdc5a2144faadb54cdc9ea512d5f718e","category":"Tech"}
