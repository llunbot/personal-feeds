Google's Wednesday blog post calls this part of a \"GFiber Labs\" experiment and says the service \"will initially be available as an early access offering to a small group of GFiber customers in select areas.\"</p>\n<p>The 20Gbps service is made possible by new networking gear: Nokia's 25G PON (passive optical network) technology, which lets Internet service providers push more bandwidth over existing fiber lines. Google says it's \"one of the first\" ISPs to adopt the technology for consumers, though at least one other US ISP, the Tennessee provider <a href=\"https://www.fiercetelecom.com/broadband/epbs-new-25-gig-broadband-service-costs-whopping-1500mo\">\"EPB,\"</a> has rolled out the technology. Customers will need new networking gear, too, and Google says you'll get a new fiber modem with built-in Wi-Fi 7.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fiercetelecom.com/broadband/google-fiber-goes-big-20-gig-plan\">Fierce Telecom</a> spoke with Google's Nick Saporito, head of product at Google Fiber, who said, â€œWe definitely see a need\" for 20Gbps service. For now, Saporito says the service is \"a very early adopter product,\" but it will eventually roll out \"in most, if not all, of our markets.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978969#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978969&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19125c28efa6226353e31e4ab2413da55debba161661668fd33e5fb5bc65a3ce","category":"Tech"}
