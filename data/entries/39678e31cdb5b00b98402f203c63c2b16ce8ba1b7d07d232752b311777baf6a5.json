In this article we're highlighting a deal from Verizon-owned <a href=\"https://visible.pxf.io/b3VBVv\">Visible Wireless</a>, which is a low-cost alternative to the big name carriers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPhone-13-Feature-Blue.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

You'll need to join Visible as a new customer and transfer your number from an eligible carrier to get this deal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://visible.pxf.io/b3VBVv\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>FREE HOMEPOD MINI</div>iPhone 13 at Visible</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAfter completing three months of service payments on your iPhone 13, Visible will send an email with a code to redeem the virtual gift card. For the HomePod mini, you just need to purchase one of the four new iPhone 13 models, transfer your number, activate the new smartphone, and then you'll get an email with a code to redeem the free HomePod mini on Visible's store.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nVisible offers monthly payment plan options, or you can pay the full price of the iPhone 13 up front. Although this deal doesn't include straight cash discounts on the new iPhones, getting about $300 worth in value with the purchase of the smartphone could be worth it for some shoppers, especially those who don't yet own a HomePod mini.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor offers on the iPhone 13 from other carriers, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/iphone-13-order-carriers/\">visit our roundup of deals</a> from carriers and retailers on the new smartphones.
