old files that might be clogging up your Mac’s drive, deleting duplicate photos, or uninstalling apps and software completely so that they don’t leave behind any old files that are no longer needed. However, few of those cleanup apps are as comprehensive as CleanMyMac from MacPaw, which has been updated to version 5.0 (and dropped the ‘X’ from its name, as version 4 was called CleanMyMac X).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can buy CleanMyMac either from MacPaw’s own <a href=\"https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, or from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cleanmymac/id1339170533?mt=12\" target=\"_blank\">Mac App Store</a>, although the version sold on the Mac App Store omits a few features (due to technical restrictions imposed by Apple). If you buy it directly from MacPaw then CleanMyMac requires an annual subscription of $39.95/£30.95, or you can buy it for a one-time fee of $119.95/£101.95. CleanMyMac 5.0 requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later, but the previous CleanMyMac X (4.0) can still be downloaded for macOS 10 Catalina.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>See how CleanMyMac compares to other Mac Cleaners in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673271/best-mac-cleaner-vs-cleanmymac.html\">Best Mac Cleaner software</a> round-up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not the cheapest cleanup app available for the Mac, but CleanMyMac provides dozens of different tools for deleting old files and data. And, like previous versions, the new version 5.0 groups all those tools into five main categories that focus on different tasks – Cleanup, Protection, Performance, Applications and My Clutter. It’s worth exploring each set of tools to see how the program works but, for convenience, there’s also a Smart Care feature that gives your Mac drive a quick check-up and summarises the result of its scans for all five categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cleanup tools focus on deleting junk: old files and documents that are taking up valuable space, or old system files that are no longer needed. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"CleanMyMac Junk Files found\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2624w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-1.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-1.jpg?resize=768%2C487&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C761&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C974&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1299&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"761\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Screenshot</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Protection tools dig a bit deeper and can scan for malware that might cause a threat to your Mac. While the app works well with macOS’ Gatekeeper function in working to prevent malware installation on your Mac, it’s still possible to install a good amount of questionable software. Yes, the Malware Removal module was able to detect and quarantine several threats (such as OSX.EvilEgg, DazzleSpy, and parts of the AdWind malware), but it left segments of AdWind installed in tests, as well as missed the questionable WaveBrowser, a mock version of Adobe Flash Player Install Manager, Adobe album and the infamous MacSecurity app, which had to be removed with another application. This was disappointing considering MacPaw’s well-marketed and hyped use of the Moonlock Engine for this purpose. CleanMyMac isn’t a dedicated anti-virus program so it doesn’t provide the same level of protection as the programs featured in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668850/best-mac-antivirus-software.html\">Best Antivirus for Mac</a> round-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance tools help with routine maintenance, clearing out the DNS cache that is used for web browsing, re-indexing Spotlight and Mail to speed up search results, and keeping track of your Login and Background items (which you can also do using System Settings on your Mac).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common task that many people ask about is how to completely delete applications from their Mac, as many applications leave behind old files and bits of data even after you delete the application itself. The Applications tools in CleanMyMac can help with that task, deleting app leftovers and installation files, and also reminding you of any old applications that you may not have used recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there’s My Clutter, which can scan either individual folders or your entire Mac drive to locate old files that you haven’t used for a long time, or particularly large files that take up a lot of space. This latest version gains some new features here, including the ability to identify duplicate files, or photos that look very similar so that you can delete them if you want to. There are also some new diagnostic tools, including the ability to identify apps that are using a lot of battery power on your laptop.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"CleanMyMac Interface Update \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2624w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C796&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1019&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1358&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"796\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Screenshot</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the most important change in version 5.0 is probably the redesigned interface. Previous versions of CleanMyMac could use each set of tools to scan your Mac automatically, but would then throw long lists of files and data onto the screen and leave you to decide which files you wanted to keep or delete – which could be confusing for many users who don’t have the necessary level of technical knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CleanMyMac 5.0 simplifies things by displaying the results of its scans as a series of tiles that give you a quick summary of each scan. So the Application tools will display tiles that break the results down into app leftovers that are left behind when you delete applications, or installation files that are used when you first install a new app. Other tiles will tell you about apps that are waiting for updates, or old apps that haven’t been used for a long time. If you want more information then each tile has a Review button that can display the entire list of relevant files, or you can simply hit the Remove button and allow CleanMyMac to automatically delete everything for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should You Buy CleanMyMac?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people do argue that utilities such as this are completely unnecessary, and it is certainly possible to perform most of these Mac maintenance tasks yourself – as long as you have a reasonable amount of technical knowledge. But, if you don’t know your DNS cache from your universal binaries, then a well-designed app such as CleanMacMac can simplify these tasks for you, and help to keep your Mac fighting fit.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6a1bae775e7e2b44c836f3be6bfd94cd9a8e6c18e5f9c88711eb2bd99535495f","category":"Apple"}
