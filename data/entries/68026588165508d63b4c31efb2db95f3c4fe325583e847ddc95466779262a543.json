Arising in the Northern District of California, the lawsuit accused Google of continuing to \"track, collect, and identify [users'] browsing data in real time\" even when they had opened a new Incognito window.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit, filed by Florida resident William Byatt and California residents Chasom Brown and Maria Nguyen, accused Google of violating wiretap laws. It also alleged that sites using Google Analytics or Ad Manager collected information from browsers in Incognito mode, including web page content, device data, and IP address. The plaintiffs also accused Google of taking Chrome users' private browsing activity and then associating it with their already-existing user profiles.</p>\n<p>Google initially attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed by pointing to the message displayed when users turned on Chrome's incognito mode. That warning tells users that their activity \"might still be visible to websites you visit.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992954#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992954&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"68026588165508d63b4c31efb2db95f3c4fe325583e847ddc95466779262a543","category":"Tech"}
