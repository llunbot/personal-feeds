This reduces the build-up of “stagnant air and additional air resistance” that riders would otherwise need to overcome.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The vents are placed in a high-pressure zone (red) in order to help reduce drag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>POC</i></span></div>\n<h2>CFD modelled shape</h2>\n<p>As with the Tempor, Cerebel Raceday and recently launched <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/poc-propel-sunglasses/\">Propel aero sunglasses</a>, the POC Procen was designed using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) modelling and analysis.</p>\n<p>POC says it performed 3D scans of a number of athletes from its sponsored men’s and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-womens-worldtour-bikes/\">women’s WorldTour teams</a>, EF Education-EasyPost and EF Education-Tibco-SVB.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Magnus Cort of EF Education-EasyPost was 3D-scanned for use as a CFD model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>POC</i></span></div>\n<p>These models were then used to optimise the Procen for a range of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trial positions</a>.</p>\n<p>The truncated trailing edge of the helmet is similar to that seen on the Kask Beluga.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> One of POC’s 3D rider scans in its CFD development tool.</span></figcaption><span> <i>POC</i></span></div>\n<p>POC says it has been shaped to reduce turbulence and enable the airflow from the outer edge of the helmet to combine cleanly with that coming from inside of it.</p>\n<p>The Procen also uses a very subtly flared edge on the rear side edges, which POC says helps to direct airflow over the rider’s shoulders.</p>\n<p>This shaping is much less radical than on the Tempor, though.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Procen has a subtle flare along the trailing side edges.</span></figcaption><span> <i>POC</i></span></div>\n<p>When asked “which helmet is fastest?”, POC said it would “depend on the rider” and their position on the bike, but that it is “extremely happy” with the aerodynamic performance of the Procen.</p>\n<p>It also noted that getting the best out of the Tempor typically “requires a precise body position and technique”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zoe Bäckstedt of EF Education-TIBCO-SVB testing the POC Procen in the Silverstone Sports Engineering Hub wind tunnel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>POC</i></span></div>\n<p>Indeed, when we <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/poc-tempor-aero-helmet-in-brief-review/\">reviewed the Tempor back in 2014</a>, it proved extremely fast in a wind tunnel and the real world.</p>\n<p>Our tester also found it to be very sensitive to changes in head position, however, making it tricky to recommend as an option for riders who couldn’t optimise their bike fit around the helmet, or hold a consistent head position while racing.</p>\n<p>POC says the Procen takes knowledge gleaned from the Tempor (and Cerebel Raceday) but puts it in a package that’s better ventilated and less sensitive to changes in head position.</p>\n<h2>Adjustable visor, one size, no fluorescent orange</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The POC Procen is available in ‘Hydrogen White’.</span></figcaption><span> <i>POC</i></span></div>\n<p>The final trick up the Procen’s sleeve is an adjustable, detachable visor.</p>\n<p>POC says the Clarity lens can be positioned to sit “around 10mm” away from the helmet to prevent fogging while a rider is waiting to start their race.
