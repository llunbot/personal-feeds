The back of the devices will supposedly have a new \"part-aluminum, part-glass\" design. The frame could end up using a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">combination of both aluminimum and titanium</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Rectangular camera bump:</strong> On a related note, the devices are expected to have a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">larger rectangular camera bump</a>\" made of aluminum. There are conflicting rumors about the camera lenses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/iphone-17-pro-to-stick-with-triangular-camera/\">sticking with a triangular arrangement</a> or being repositioned horizontally or vertically.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>A19 Pro chip:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to use Apple's next-generation A19 Pro chip, which will reportedly be manufactured <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/\">with TSMC's newer third-generation 3nm process</a>. Like usual, expect modest year-over-year performance gains and power efficiency improvements compared to the current iPhones.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip:</strong> At least one iPhone 17 model is rumored to get a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/kuo-iphone-17-apple-wi-fi-7-chip/\">Wi-Fi 7 chip designed by Apple</a> rather than Broadcom. However, another report said the chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/\">will support Wi-Fi 6E</a> like iPhone 16 models.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>24-megapixel front camera:</strong> All four iPhone 17 models are said to feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/\">upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera</a>, whereas all iPhone 16 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>48-megapixel rear Telephoto camera:</strong> An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/\">upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto camera</a> is rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/\">for the iPhone 17 Pro models</a>, up from the 12-megapixel Telephoto camera on iPhone 16 Pro models.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>12GB of RAM:</strong> An increased 12GB of RAM was initially rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/kuo-12gb-ram-iphone-17-pro-max-exclusive/\">exclusively for the iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, but later the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/\">iPhone 17 Pro as well</a>. This upgrade should help to improve the performance of Apple Intelligence and multitasking. All four iPhone 16 models have 8GB of RAM.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>A smaller Dynamic Island for iPhone 17 Pro Max:</strong> A change rumored exclusively for the iPhone 17 Pro Max is a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/\">much narrowed Dynamic Island</a>,\" as a result of Apple adopting a \"metalens\" for the Face ID system.</li></ul>Bookmark our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17 roundup</a> to stay up to date with more rumors over the coming months.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features-so-far/\">iPhone 17 Pro Launching Later This Year With These 8 New Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-launching-later-this-year-with-these-8-new-features.2447042/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2af58b0b1c3853153354be0545c26cc34c1416678b808d13675a21135b1c9b49","category":"Apple"}
