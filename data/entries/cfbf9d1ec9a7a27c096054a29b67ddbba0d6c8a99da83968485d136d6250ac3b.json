Select ‘Agree’ to \nagree to these updated Terms and to continue enjoying our products \nand services. Press * to view these updated Terms.” A large button \nreading “Agree” follows. The pop-up doesn’t offer a way to \ndisagree, and users are unable to use their device unless they hit \nagree. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Roku has further aggravated customers who have found that \ndisagreeing to its updated terms is harder than necessary. Roku is \nwilling to accept agreement to its terms with a single button \npress, but to opt out, users must jump through hoops that include \nfinding that old book of stamps. </p>\n\n<p>To opt out of Roku’s ToS update, which primarily changes the \n“<a href=\"https://docs.roku.com/published/disputeresolution/en/us\">Dispute Resolution Terms</a>,” users must send a letter to \nRoku’s general counsel in California mentioning: “the name of each \nperson opting out and contact information for each such person, \nthe specific product models, software, or services used that are \nat issue, the email address that you used to set up your Roku \naccount (if you have one), and, if applicable, a copy of your \npurchase receipt.” Roku required all this to opt out of its terms \npreviously, as well. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Requiring a written letter (and a copy of the purchase receipt — how many people keep that for what may well be a years-old purchase?) is just a huge “fuck you” to their customers.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/11/roku-tos\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cfbf9d1ec9a7a27c096054a29b67ddbba0d6c8a99da83968485d136d6250ac3b","category":"Tech"}
