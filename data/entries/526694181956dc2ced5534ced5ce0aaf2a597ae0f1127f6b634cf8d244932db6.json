This edition focuses on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-ardennes-classics\" target=\"_blank\">Ardennes Week</a> opener of the Amstel Gold Race after thrilling finales, with Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) swooping in for victory after Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) celebrated too early.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a

The police officer was taken to hospital by ambulance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The neutralisation lasted over an hour as riders were seen sitting down on the ground and petting spectators’ dogs. The race was eventually diverted, skipping around 40km of the planned route and restarted with 55km remaining for three laps of a finishing circuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s race was also later rerouted to avoid clashing with the later-running women’s race and the incident site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lorena Wiebes celebrates too early</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Marianne Vos WINS Amstel Gold Women right on the line! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3c1.png\" alt=\"🏁\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png\" alt=\"🤯\" /><br /><br />The Visma-Lease a Bike rider steals victory from Lorena Wiebes with a 𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒍𝒚-𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆𝒅 throw!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AGR2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#AGR2024</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XrusDsIBcT\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/XrusDsIBcT</a></p>— Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurosport/status/1779485053984080145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was unfortunately a nightmare finish for SD Worx-Protime’s Lorena Wiebes. Lidl-Trek had helped catch the three-woman breakaway, clawing them back after the last ascent of the Cauberg in the final two kilometres. The remaining sprinters were unleashed in the last 150m. A fast finish followed with Wiebes – coming off a strong seventh at Paris-Roubaix – initially leading the way. She looked over her right shoulder but didn’t check the left, where she would have seen an emerging Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), who recently celebrated hitting 250 wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiebes raised her arms in an early celebration only for Vos to ride past her on for victory. She took to Instagram after the race to bemoan her early celebration resulting in a second place, calling herself an ‘idiot sandwich’.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tom Pidcock finally wins Amstel Gold</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tom-Pidcock-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-by-Luc-Claessen.jpg 1417w\" /><figcaption>Luc Claessen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2021 Amstel Gold Race resulted in a photo finish between official winner Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers). After the race, controversy ensued as the photo finish looked to be taken before the marked finish line and the side-camera looked to show the opposite result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2024 and Pidcock made the front four-man group with Marc Hirschi (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>), Tiesj Benoot (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a>) and Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal-QuickStep). With a chasing group breathing down their necks, they launched their sprints in the final 300m. Vansevenant led things out before Pidcock burst through to win with Hirschi second and Benoot third. No photo finishes this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/amstel-gold-race-2024\">Pro Log: Lorena Wiebes celebrates too early as Marianne Vos and Tom Pidcock kick off Ardennes Week with Amstel Gold Race wins</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"526694181956dc2ced5534ced5ce0aaf2a597ae0f1127f6b634cf8d244932db6","category":"Cycling"}
