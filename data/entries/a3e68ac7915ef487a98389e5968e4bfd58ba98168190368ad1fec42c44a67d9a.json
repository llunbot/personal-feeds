But at the moment, I’m most fascinated by \nits industrial design. That petite all-in-one beige case, created \nby Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama, was unlike anything anyone had \nseen until then — at least outside of a kitchen. [...] </p>\n\n<p>But if all the first Mac inspires is nostalgia, we’ve lost sight \nof how daring it was. Unlike Apple’s first blockbuster PC, the \n<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90614203/watch-a-tv-news-report-on-the-wacky-apple-ii-knockoffs-of-the-1980s\">Apple II</a>, it had a built-in display but no integrated \nkeyboard. It also sacrificed most of the Apple II’s defining \nfeatures, such as its dazzling color graphics and expansion slots. </p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, it’s among the gutsiest gambits Apple ever made. \nImagine the company introducing a new smartphone that has \nvirtually nothing in common with the iPhone. You can’t — or at \nleast it strains my imagination. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s what kept me from <em>getting</em> the Mac until I owned one. The Apple II defined what I thought of as a computer, and because the Mac didn’t resemble the Apple II in <em>any way</em> — it didn’t even have a compatibility mode to run Apple II software — it seemed like something else to me. An appliance of some sort, not a <em>computer</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out it was the best concept for a computer anyone has ever devised.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/mccracken-original-macintosh\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a3e68ac7915ef487a98389e5968e4bfd58ba98168190368ad1fec42c44a67d9a","category":"Tech"}
