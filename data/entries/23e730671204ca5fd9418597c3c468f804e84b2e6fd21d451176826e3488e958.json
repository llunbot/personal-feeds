An ‌iPhone‌ on the ‌AirPower‌ charger would also have shown the charge of all of the devices that were placed on the pad. ‌AirPower‌ missed its original 2018 launch date goal, and after a large number of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/17/airpower-doomed-to-failure-engineering-issues/\">issues with its development</a>, Apple outright <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/\">canceled the AirPower project</a> in March 2019.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nImages depicting ‌AirPower‌ prototypes first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/21/alleged-airpower-internals-photos/\">surfaced on social media in August 2020</a>, showing a multi-coil design and the device's internal circuitry, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/working-airpower-prototype-shown-in-video-clip/\">first video footage</a> of the device emerged in August 2021. Multiple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/19/video-look-at-airpower-prototype/\">other AirPower prototypes</a> have appeared since then, but most are no longer functional.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Prototype Apple AirPower with 16 coils (PROTO1) charging a Prototype Apple Watch Series 4 (DVT). It’s amazing that Apple Watch charging works, given wireless chargers today generally can’t charge Apple Watches. However, the Apple Watch on AirPower gets quite warm. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#appleinternal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GfywG3KZS9\">pic.twitter.com/GfywG3KZS9</a></p>— Apple Demo (@AppleDemoYT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT/status/1777003651434680788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA <a href=\"https://x.com/AppleDemoYT/status/1777003651434680788\">new video</a> from the X user \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT\">Apple Demo</a>,\" who has showcased various Apple prototypes in the past, demonstrates the ‌AirPower‌'s ability to charge an Apple Watch. The device features 16 coils and can charge a DVT prototype Apple Watch Series 4, but it apparently gets quite warm. Late last year, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/prototype-shows-why-apple-abandoned-airpower/\">functional AirPower prototype</a> from early on in its development exhibited some of the severe thermal problems, including burning or melting devices placed on the charging pad, that ultimately led Apple to abandon the project. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌AirPower‌'s ability to charge an Apple Watch would have been special because Apple's smartwatch is only able to charge via its magnetic charging puck and does not support Qi. Simply placing an Apple Watch anywhere on the ‌AirPower‌ pad with no magnetic alignment would have been a unique charging experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors in subsequent years about Apple's work on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/29/kuo-on-apple-first-half-of-2020/\">smaller wireless charger</a> seem to have been related to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> or the ‌MagSafe‌ Duo charger, rather than ‌AirPower‌. Nevertheless, a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> in 2022 said that Apple is still looking into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/09/gurman-airpods-and-mac-accessories-usb-c-by-2024/\">AirPower-like charging solutions</a> for the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update</strong>: Apple Demo has now shared a new video of the ‌AirPower‌ prototype.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/\">Prototypes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/airpower-seen-charging-apple-watch/\">AirPower Prototype Seen Charging Apple Watch for First Time</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpower-prototype-seen-charging-apple-watch-for-first-time.2423757/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23e730671204ca5fd9418597c3c468f804e84b2e6fd21d451176826e3488e958","category":"Apple"}
