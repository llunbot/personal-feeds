For those living in more urban locations where some considerable road miles must be covered to get to the gravel and back home again, the Caracal ALL ROAD could eliminate some pre-ride tire or wheel changes. It also could reduce consternation about which tire is suited to a given route that involves a balanced mix of road and gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Two riders use the Caracal ALL ROAD on a stretch of paved road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-20-1-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Caracal ALL ROAD will get you to the fun stuff quickly.

This 127 TPI casing offers excellent flexibility and reliability under a wide variety of conditions on both pavement and gravel. Although sharing the same base of construction as the Caracal Race, the Caracal ALL ROAD features additional polyamide reinforcement under the tread. This provides increased puncture protection, making the Caracal ALL ROAD more rugged and adaptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2044\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/section-CARACAL-all-road-3-4-1-scaled-e1744341180338.webp\" alt=\"A rendered cross-section view of the Caracal ALL Road installed and inflated on a rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/section-CARACAL-all-road-3-4-1-scaled-e1744341180338.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/section-CARACAL-all-road-3-4-1-scaled-e1744341180338-297x237.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/section-CARACAL-all-road-3-4-1-scaled-e1744341180338-1536x1226.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/section-CARACAL-all-road-3-4-1-scaled-e1744341180338-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/section-CARACAL-all-road-3-4-1-scaled-e1744341180338-768x613.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/section-CARACAL-all-road-3-4-1-scaled-e1744341180338-2048x1635.webp 2048w\" /><figcaption>Beneath the tread, the Caracal ALL ROAD is a durable construction.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a similar profile to its Caracal siblings, the ALL ROAD features a smooth central tread pattern for reduced rolling resistance on the road, closely mimicking the feel of a wide-section slick road tire. The Caracal ALL ROAD features Mach Tread 3.0 rubber, originally developed for Hutchinson’s latest generation of super fast road tyres, which allows the Caracal ALL ROAD to fully exploit its grippy road potential while providing the necessary assurance to venture onto more demanding surfaces. Moving out to the shoulders, pronounced side knobs aid off-road cornering traction and boost control on loose surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CARACAL_-98-720x480.webp 720w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Available in a 700 x 35mm width only, a size the will clear any gravel bike and even a handful of road bikes, the Caracal ALL ROAD promises reduced fatigue and enhanced traction on rough terrain and smooth tarmac.
