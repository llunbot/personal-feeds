There may be no better time to get your hands on Apple gear, plus accessories for Macs and iPhones, as well as other tech of interest to Apple diehards. Read on for all the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Prime Day 2025?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start by saying that Amazon hasn’t yet made an official announcement, so we’re working on guesstimates based on historical precedent. Usually, Amazon’s event takes place in the second or third week of July. Based on this history,  will will surmise Amazon’s 2025 event will take place on July 8-9 or July 15-16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors have been swirling that Amazon is considering a longer event in 2025. Whether Prime Day will last its typical two days, or go for the full week like the Spring sale or Black Friday remains to be seen. We’ll know when Amazon makes its dates official.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When was Prime Day in previous years?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous years, Amazon’s Prime Day event lasted for 48 hours, and always started on a Tuesday. Let’s check out the exact dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2024</strong>: July 16-17 and October 8-9</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2023</strong>: July 11-12 and Oct 10-11</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2022</strong>: July 12-13 and October 11-12</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2021</strong>: June 21-22</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2020</strong>: October 13-14</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What do you need to do to get access to Prime Day deals?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon’s Prime Day event is dedicated to Amazon Prime members. So, if you’re paying for a subscription to get free shipping and faster deliveries, as well as a bunch of other perks, you’re already good to go. If you’re not already subscribed, you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">start a 30-day free trial</a>, although we’d suggest waiting a couple more weeks, at least, so you can make sure the trial extends through all potential Prime Day dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">Amazon Prime</a> costs $14.99 per month or you could pay $139 for the whole year. If you’re a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?primeCampaignId=studentWlpPrimeRedir&amp;ref=std_prime_desktop\">student</a>, you can get it for as little as $7.49 per month or $69 per year. Discounts are also available for folks who receive government assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s true that most deals on Prime Day are dedicated to members, there will be plenty of discounts that come with such requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What can you expect on Prime Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Day is the sale event when a ton of tech products get their best discounts. Oftentimes, these discounts are better than we’ll see on Black Friday—and that’s saying quite a bit. We expect to see great discounts across the board for Apple tech, from iPads to MacBooks, smartwatches, and all the accessories. We also think we’ll see loads of discounts for SSDs, monitors, chargers, and smart home tech. If you’re also into Amazon’s brands, expect fantastic deals for those too, from Kindle to Ring to Echo, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deals you can get ahead of Prime Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Day is a fantastic time for shoppers, but there are loads of deals to get right now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/\">Apple MacBook Air M4, 13-inch, 16GB memory, 256GB storage</a>: $849 (15% off $999)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">Apple AirPods Pro 2</a>: $170 (32% off $249)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8HHV9DK/\">Anker 20W 2-port chargers with type-C cables, 2-pack</a>: $12 (37% off $19)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863TXGM3/\">Sony WH-1000XM4</a>: $228 (34% off $348)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1DZNL3H/\">Samsung ViewFinity S7 S70D 27-inch</a>: $200 (43% off $350)</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ffd52f97ce0702f7e59e846ce74a797e2912ba4e40ed0997b60e84ceb7e3538c","category":"Apple"}
