Her first act <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/nasa-moves-swiftly-to-end-dei-programs-ask-employees-to-report-violations/\">was to tell agency employees</a> to remove diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility contracts and to \"report\" on anyone who did not carry out this order.
