Canyon Bicycles’ customers can now get authorized service for their bikes at REI. Why REI Co-op? Well REI is one of the nation’s largest specialty outdoor retailers and consumer cooperatives. So it makes sense that Canyon would choose REI to expand and strengthen its existing service network.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Canyon X REI Authorized Service Partners shop image hero Large\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-shop-image-hero-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / REI)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Worry, There Will Be Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to make sure Canyon customers have the best experience at REI shops, the two brands are working together to offer the best service. Come 2025, more than 190 REI “bike shop” locations across the country will be trained and certified as Canyon-authorized service partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the press release, REI customers as well as Canyon bicycle owners will benefit from the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased local service coverage</strong>: Convenient access to professional service at a network of trusted REI locations across the U.S.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Expert mechanic services</strong>: REI’s skilled and certified mechanics can service all Canyon models, including road, gravel, mountain bike, and e-bikes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seamless process integration</strong>: REI can easily support customers through advanced customer service processes. Such as frame warranty claims and crash replacements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Canyon Says:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-gravel-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"553\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-gravel-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Canyon X REI Authorized Service Partners gravel Large\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-gravel-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-gravel-Large-297x128.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-gravel-Large-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-gravel-Large-768x332.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Canyon Bicycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Straight from the Press Release: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>At Canyon, we are committed to providing exceptional experiences throughout the customer journey,</em>” says Jaclyn Mayer, Canyon’s Senior Director of Customer Experience. “<em>Working with REI allows us to dramatically expand our service ecosystem, making it easier than ever for our U.S. customers to access high-quality maintenance, service, repairs, and small parts</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What REI Says:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-hiking-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"916\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-hiking-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Canyon X REI Authorized Service Partners hiking Large\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-hiking-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-hiking-Large-297x213.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-hiking-Large-120x86.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-X-REI-Authorized-Service-Partners-hiking-Large-768x550.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / REI)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>REI is excited to welcome Canyon service into the co-op, a brand renowned for its innovative and high-performance bikes</em>,” says Alicia Applegate, REI general manager for action sports. “<em>This collaboration allows us to further elevate our industry-leading shop service benefits to our members and provide Canyon bike owners with exceptional service</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absent from the press release was any mention of REI selling Canyon bikes, parts, or accessories. For now, it’s service only. Though it seems like this service partnership may be laying the groundwork for a greater partnership in the future – might we see Canyon Bikes in an REI showroom in the near future? We’ll have to wait and see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every cyclist can have their bike serviced at one of REI’s “bike shops” if they wish. But, those that are members of the Co-op, will receive 20% off their service as part of their lifetime benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can visit <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-us/customer-service/repair-spares-warranty/bike-service-finder.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to find your nearest authorized service partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out more details below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.rei.com/\" target=\"_blank\">REI.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rei-co-op-becomes-authorized-service-partner-for-canyon-bicycles/\">REI Co-op Becomes Authorized Service Partner for Canyon Bicycles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5a20ac91a6010181e05df28b5f0cb1ea60654e41b3af8d10fb7850fccb2fee99","category":"Cycling"}
