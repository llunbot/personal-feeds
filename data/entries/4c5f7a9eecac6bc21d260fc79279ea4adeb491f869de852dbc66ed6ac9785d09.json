It’s been a tumultuous few years for the premium Swedish suspension maker – and the cycling industry, as a whole. But Öhlins seems psyched to have been acquired by another premium brand steeped in two-wheel racing, and is optimistic that the innovative tech they’ve been working on will more quickly find its way into suspension components you and I can actually buy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that mean electronically-controlled Öhlins XC &amp; DH suspension is just around the corner? We’ll be in the race pits when the season starts to see if we can find out more…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brembo buys Öhlins Racing, restokes MTB development</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development.webp\" alt=\"Brembo buys Öhlins Racing, rejuvenating MTB suspension development,\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development-297x175.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development-768x452.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Öhlins)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been just 6 years since US automotive giant<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/former-marzocchi-owner-tenneco-buys-ohlins-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\"> Tenneco</a> bought out Öhlins, which then evolved into <a href=\"https://www.driv.com/our-company\" target=\"_blank\">Driv</a>. The Swedish racing suspension brand’s unique technologies were certainly appealing to the automotive parts conglomerate, and Öhlins benefited from some other motorsports suspension specialists under the same parent. But ultimately, an asset management company bought out Tenneco/Driv itself for restructuring in 2022. And maybe Öhlins didn’t fit well into the larger automotive group? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From 2023-mid 2024 Öhlins restructured its mountain bike suspension development to be more efficient, at the same time as launching an <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ohlins-xc-race-ready-suspension-3-rxc34-forks-2-txcair-shocks-hit-the-world-cup/\" target=\"_blank\">all-new XC suspension</a> category. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing.webp\" alt=\"Brembo buys Öhlins Racing, rejuvenating MTB suspension development, DH setup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-testing-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doubling down on refining their now wide XC to DH range and at the same time continuing to use elite MTB racing as a testing grounds, it seemed like it might be a while until we saw more Öhlins suspension innovations. It’s true that outside of XC, their release of all-new commercial products seemed to have slowed a bit in recent years. But still, we keep spotting cutting-edge mountain bike suspension prototypes raced on the World Cup circuit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters.webp\" alt=\"Brembo buys Öhlins Racing, rejuvenating MTB suspension development,  World CUp DH setup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Brembo-buys-Ohlins-Racing-restokes-mountain-bike-suspension-development_DH-World-Cup-setup-photo-by-Billy-Ceusters-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/billy_lebelge/\" target=\"_blank\">Billy Ceusters</a>/Öhlins)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, under the auspices of <a href=\"https://www.brembogroup.com/en/who-we-are\" target=\"_blank\">Brembo</a> – a more innovation-driven parent company, Öhlins suggests that their newly “<em>reallocated resources and focus will increase the conversion of racetrack innovation into consumer products.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“As of January 2nd, Öhlins Racing is part of the Brembo Group. The companies share the same passion for innovation, technology and performance; as well as the desire to be the best at what they do. There’s great excitement within the Öhlins organization to now join forces with Brembo, a brand and company that matches Öhlins’ ambition to be at the forefront of everything that they do.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>They call it “<em>new beginnings for Öhlins Racing’s Mountain Bike segment under Brembo’s ownership</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should we expect?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/loic-bruni-specialized-demo-carbon-cover-hiding-ohlins-coil-shock-electronic-suspension-damping.jpg\"><img

target=\"_blank\">in early 2023</a>, by the start of the 2024 racing season we already were spotting electronically-controlled XC suspension too. These had smaller remote switches, and no prominent indicator LEDs, but there’s undeniably some prototype Öhlins suspension control happening in that little black box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guess is that we’ll see a lot more of both of these when the 2025 World Cup comes around. Hopefully, we could even see commercial versions of both available to the public by the end of this year…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ohlins.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ohlins.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/brembo-buys-ohlins-promises-conversion-of-racetrack-innovation-into-consumer-products/\">Brembo Buys Öhlins, Promises ‘Conversion of Racetrack Innovation into Consumer Products’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4c5f7a9eecac6bc21d260fc79279ea4adeb491f869de852dbc66ed6ac9785d09","category":"Cycling"}
