According to <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ACK-J/65dfe84fcf5a06c46364e5f2bd29c118\">this list</a> compiled in 2021 by a researcher who goes by the handle G666g1e, 744 websites scanned visitorsâ€™ ports, most or all without providing notice or seeking permission in advance. eBay, Chick-fil-A, Best Buy, Kroger, and Macy's were among the offending websites.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ebay_port_scan.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ebay_port_scan-640x469.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ebay_port_scan-1280x939.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ebay_port_scan.png\"></a> (credit: <a href=\"Charlie%20Belmer\">https://nullsweep.com/why-is-this-website-port-scanning-me/</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Some sites use similar tactics in an attempt to fingerprint visitors so they can be re-identified each time they return, even if they delete browser cookies. By running scripts that access local resources on the visiting devices, the sites can detect unique patterns in a visiting browser. Sometimes there are benign reasons a site will access local resources, such as detecting insecurities or allowing developers to test their websites. Often, however, there are more abusive or malicious motives involved.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950882#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950882&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c8f2426dcab5cc6e0e85274d097d7b59d0bf0a11c078a2fc27fb03f218a7d090","category":"Tech"}
