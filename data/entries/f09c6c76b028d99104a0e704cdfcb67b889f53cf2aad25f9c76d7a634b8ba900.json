Chief Judge\nJames Boasberg laid out how he came to believe that the Trump\nadministration was acting in bad faith during its Alien Enemies\nAct removals.</p>\n\n<p>Boasberg set the stage for potential contempt prosecutions in the\norder. He also detailed what he came to see as the Trump\nadministration’s scheme to shield its plan to use rarely invoked\nwartime powers to remove more than 100 Venezuelans to a Salvadoran\ndetention facility, depriving them of due process and the courts\nof the ability to review what was taking place.</p>\n\n<p>Below are five points on Boasberg’s opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d never heard of Boasberg until recently, but he has a rather distinctive surname. Turns out he’s also the judge presiding over <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/646809/ftc-v-meta-antitrust-monopoly-trial-instagram-whatsapp\">the FTC v. Meta antitrust case that’s in court this week</a>.
