In fact, with tiny arrow-shaped knobs spread evenly across the 42mm wide tire, the Grava looks like a fast-rolling option to transition from hardpack to sandy dirt roads to fast gravel to asphalt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Onza Grava first-ever gravel bike tire</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl.jpg\" alt=\"Onza Grava 700x42mm first-ever gravel tire, on a Canyon Grizl\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_on-a-Canyon-Grizl-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jonassalamon\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Salamon</a>/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/onzatires\" target=\"_blank\">Onza</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The riders inside Onza say they’ve been riding curly bar bikes off-road for years, so it was bound to happen that they’d adapt their MTB know-how to create their own gravel tire. Developed to be a versatile all-rounder, the Onza Grava actually means ‘fine gravel’.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread.jpg\" alt=\"Onza Grava 700x42mm first-ever gravel tire, new tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_tread-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You get a fast-rolling line of wider low-profile centerline tread blocks, lined by 3 rows of narrower, sharp-edged transition knobs.

Plus there’s then reinforced sidewalls and a protection layer under the tread. It gets a 60a durometer single compound rubber for balanced grip, durability &amp; fast rolling. And tire weights start at a claimed 503g for the tanwall. Add about 15-16g for all black or white rubber.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Onza Grava – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_colors.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_colors.jpg\" alt=\"Onza Grava 700x42mm first-ever gravel tire, color options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_colors.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_colors-297x132.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_colors-1536x683.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_colors-120x53.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Onza-Grava-700x42mm-first-ever-gravel-tire_colors-768x341.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In classic Onza style, you can get the new Grava gravel tire in all black if you want.
