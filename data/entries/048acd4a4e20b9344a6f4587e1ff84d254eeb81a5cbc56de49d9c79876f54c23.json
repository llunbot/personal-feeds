Keen on both but can’t decide which one is right for you? In this detailed comparison we’ll break down the key differences between the two bikes, making the Grail vs Grizl decision an easier one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/the-canyon-grail-reinventing-the-handlebar\" target=\"_blank\">First launched in 2018</a>, the original Canyon Grail quickly won over riders with its mixture of versatility and affordable direct-to-consumer pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A competent gravel bike that also does a superb turn as a do-it-all drop-bar bicycle, the Grail is equally at home <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a> as it is being ridden to work. You could even pop slick tyres on and use it on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even as the Grail continued to snaffle up a large share of the market, Canyon was working on something a bit more rugged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emerging from deep in the woods, Canyon’s Grizl was a chunkier gravel bike with an even wilder streak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grizl launched in May 2021, featuring bigger tyres, more mounting points, and builds featuring suspension forks – all things suggesting it was being aimed at more extreme kinds of off-road riding than the Grail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, two gravel bikes, each available in carbon and aluminium variants, each with slightly different priorities. But which is right for you; the Canyon Grail or the Canyon Grizl?

The Grizl comes with 45mm tyres and can accept alternatives up to 50mm wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both bikes make use of Schwalbe’s G-One tyres. However, the Grail favours the faster-rolling G-One R, while the Grizl uses the knobblier G-One Bite for better grip in loose conditions. (Note: some models also feature similar tyres but from Continental rather than Schwalbe).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyre clearance is a good indicator of how far you can push a bike on more extreme trails. Wider tyres provide more grip, better cushioning, and can be run softer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, they’re heavier and generate more rolling resistance, something especially noticeable on smoother surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikes will come with a particular size tyre fitted, and most brands will also suggest a maximum that the bike can accommodate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth considering that you might want to use some of the space between these two numbers for mudguards (fenders) – both the Grail and Grizl accept Canyon’s proprietary mudguards (but not standard guards, unless you’re prepared to get creative with mounting solutions).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs Grail: Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002317/grail-vs-grizl-geometry-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"grail-vs-grizl-geometry\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002317/grail-vs-grizl-geometry-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002317/grail-vs-grizl-geometry-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002317/grail-vs-grizl-geometry-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002317/grail-vs-grizl-geometry-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002317/grail-vs-grizl-geometry.jpg 1064w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Frame geometry</a> describes the angles and other measurements that make up the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without delving too deep into the details, bikes often tend towards feeling either nimble or stable. A nimble and reactive bike feels great when whipping around a flat corner but less fun when rattling down a loose and rocky trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the more rugged the terrain, the more you’ll appreciate stability over nimbleness. However, take this too far and the bike can feel sluggish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To adapt a popular phrase, pick a horse (or bicycle) suited in stature to the prevailing conditions, and you’ll be onto a winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do the Grizl and Grail stack up? Both bikes are relatively upright in the interests of both comfort and slightly more rearward distribution of their rider’s weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both also have reasonably long wheelbases for stability, and a mountain bike-esque combination of long top tubes and short stems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head angles and bottom bracket drops are almost the same on both bikes. However, the Grizl, being more off-road-focussed, is slightly taller in stack than the Grail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the Grail’s unconventional cockpit arrangement means the usual measurements of stack and reach don’t work for easy comparisons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon gets around this by using ‘Stack+’ and ‘Reach+’, which also take into account the dimensions of the bar and stem. It’s useful for comparisons within Canyon’s own range, but less helpful elsewhere as few brands adopt this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs Grail: Handlebars</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002319/canyon_hover_bar-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon_hover_bar\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002319/canyon_hover_bar-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002319/canyon_hover_bar-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002319/canyon_hover_bar-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002319/canyon_hover_bar-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002319/canyon_hover_bar-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002319/canyon_hover_bar.jpg 1280w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grail is famous for its biplane-like double handlebar, originally marketed as the Hover bar. This clever carbon fibre handlebar allows Canyon to combine a springy top section with a stiff set of drops and it’s fitted to all carbon models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside is it’s a one-piece assembly, so you can’t change the length of your stem or the width of your bars to adjust the fit without replacing the entire cockpit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also doesn’t work well with some third party accessories such as lights, although Canyon offers some options of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more affordable aluminium Grail models have more conventional (and less restrictive) aluminium drop bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, all the models of the Grizl use a more traditional drop handlebar setup, albeit in fancy carbon fibre on more expensive models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither the Grail nor the Grizl features the massively wide flared bars now popular with some gravel riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The argument for such designs is better handling for technical off-road riding. The disadvantage is they’re less well-suited to road riding, and to some eyes more aethetically challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs. Grail: Frame mounts for bikepacking and touring</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon_grizle_bikepacking\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking.jpg 1280w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying stuff in bikepacking bags or via a rack and panniers is crucial for many gravel riders. In this way, the Grail and Grizl differ pretty drastically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite making an excellent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-touring-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">touring bike</a>, the Grail misses out on rack mounts. This mean’s it’ll take strap-on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking bags</a>, but not <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/buyers-guide-the-best-bicycle-panniers\" target=\"_blank\">panniers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do get a third water bottle mount on the down tube, plus those hidden mudguard mounts, but that’s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grizl is somewhat better equipped, with mounts for additional bags on its top tube and, for non-suspension models, the fork legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon has even gone so far as commissioning a unique set of bags from bikepacking experts Apidura for the Grizl. Add in the extra squish provided by the broader tyres, plus its slightly longer wheelbase, and the Grizl is the better choice of loaded off-road touring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs Grail: Dropper compatibility and suspension</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon_grizl_suspension\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension.jpg 1280w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What is a dropper post, and why might you want one on a gravel bike? A recent import from the mountain bike segment, a dropper post is a mechanical seatpost you can lower via a switch (or ‘remote’) on the handlebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is useful as it allows you to swap between an effective saddle height for pedalling and a lower saddle height for tackling scary sections requiring more standover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, only the Grizl CF SL 8 Suspension 1by has a dropper post as standard. However, the rest of the Grizl range does have the necessary ports on the frame to fit one later if you desire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, a suspension fork is what you’ll find on the most trail-focussed Grizl builds. These models use Rockshox’s slimmed-down Rudy fork to provide 30mm of travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making for a supremely smooth ride, whether the extra weight, cost, and ongoing maintenance commitment are worth it will depend on your own preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl and Grail Ranges compared</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Grail and the Grizl come in multiple aluminium and carbon versions. The Grail range even boasts the option of motor assistance in the form of the Grail:On e-bike and, if past performance is anything to go by, an electrified Canyon Grizl:On will appear at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise offering similar price points for both bikes, each range also comes with different groupset options, along with choice features including carbon wheelsets, flexible seatposts, and different handlebar setups. Below you’ll find a quick run-through of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grail AL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002326/canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike-970x546.jpeg\" alt=\"canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002326/canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike-970x546.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002326/canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002326/canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002326/canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002326/canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002326/canyon-grail-al_gravel_bike.jpeg 1280w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry point to the Grail platform.

Starting at £1,949 for the Grizl CF SL 6, spending more sees you get the option of a suspension fork along with Canyon/Ergon’s excellent flexible VCLS seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspension models start with the £2,899 Grizl CF SL 8 Suspension 1by, which is also fitted with a dropper post. The range hits its zenith at £3,349, with the (non-suspension) Grizl CF SL 8 1by Ekar, unless you fancy the limited edition 1990s style <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/canyon-grizl-throwback\">Grizl CF SL 7 Throwback</a> with silver alloy components and retro-inspired paint job.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grizl CF SLX</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002349/canyon-bikes-grizl-slx-01.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, the SLX line represents the very fanciest iteration of the Grizl platform.

One very cool route is the Grizl CF SLX 8 1by, which costs £4,399 and comes with Campagnolo’s distinctive <a href=\"//www.cyclist.co.uk/8745/campagnolo-ekar-13-speed-1x-gravel-groupset]\" target=\"_blank\">13-speed Ekar mechanical groupset</a>. An alternative is the twin-chainring-sporting Grizl CF SLX 8 Di2, at £4,499, with a Shimano GRX Di2 groupset. Both come with DT Swiss GRC1400 Spline carbon wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grizl range tops out with the £4,799 Grizl CF SLX 8 eTap Suspension.

With slicker tyres, it’s also a great touring bike, even if it does miss out on rack mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happily, even within the Grail and Grizl lines there’s plenty of variety. For example, both ranges provide the option to pick between single or double chainring groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to each platform, there’s also the option to select a suspension fork on the Grizl or benefit from the carbon Grail’s unique handlebar setup for extra front-end comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy a Canyon Grail now from <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/performance/grail/\" target=\"_blank\">canyon.com</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buy a Canyon Grizl now from <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/adventure/grizl/\" target=\"_blank\">canyon.com</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Struggling to choose your next ride?
