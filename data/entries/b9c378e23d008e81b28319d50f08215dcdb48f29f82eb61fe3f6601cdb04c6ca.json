The Governors Highway Safety Association has just published a preliminary analysis of road safety data for the first half of 2023, and it has found a \"modest\" reduction in pedestrian fatalities, which have been all too high in recent years.</p>\n<p>As with last year's study, the GHSA found some states were much safer than others. In fact, 29 states and the District of Columbia recorded declines in the number of pedestrian traffic deaths for the first half of 2023, with Vermont recording no pedestrian deaths at all.</p>\n<p>In total, the GHSA estimates that 3,373 pedestrians died on US roads between January and June 2023, which it says is a 4 percent decrease compared to the first six months of 2022. However, the report points out that even though this year saw a small decline, the number of pedestrian deaths for the first half of 2023 is 14 percent higher than the same time period in 2019.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005974#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005974&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
