But, when you do, you’ll see a common thread. Not everyone shares the same opinion when it comes to geeking out on bike stuff. But, there is one opinion that I’m pretty sure we would all share equally. And, that is that bike thieves suck. To help defeat said losers (I’m talkin’ about the bike thieves, kids), Portland Design Works has introduced its new <a href=\"https://ridepdw.com/products/tracker-keeper?srsltid=AfmBOoqoWKOvr2X-Y3EwRiA638D85b5lLma2V1PE2u2t5Or3oRfyuokW\" target=\"_blank\">tracker device holder</a>. Introducing the Tracker Keeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-with-AirTag-e1723732813896.jpeg\"><img width=\"765\" height=\"705\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-with-AirTag-e1723732813896.jpeg\" alt=\"Portlad Design Works Tracker Keeper with AirTag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-with-AirTag-e1723732813896.jpeg 765w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-with-AirTag-e1723732813896-297x274.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-with-AirTag-e1723732813896-120x111.jpeg 120w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Portland Design Works)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tracker Keeper is a small envelope that is designed to hide an AirTag, or similarly sized tracker device. It is fastened under the saddle of your bicycle. I know there are a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/apple-find-my-bike-airbell-bike-bell-airtag/\" target=\"_blank\">few clever items out there</a> that can do this type of stealthy tracker hiding. But this one is only $15. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-open-e1723732844437.jpeg\"><img width=\"1279\" height=\"878\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-open-e1723732844437.jpeg\" alt=\"Portlad Design Works Tracker Keeper open\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-open-e1723732844437.jpeg 1279w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-open-e1723732844437-297x204.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-open-e1723732844437-120x82.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-open-e1723732844437-768x527.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-closed-e1723732859624.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"789\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-closed-e1723732859624.jpeg\" alt=\"Portlad Design Works Tracker Keeper closed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-closed-e1723732859624.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-closed-e1723732859624-297x183.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-closed-e1723732859624-120x74.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-closed-e1723732859624-768x473.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tracker Keeper is made from waterproof, 100% recycled EcoPak ballistic fabric. The material is scraps that are left over from making their Loot Bag. This is an inexpensive way to keep your bike outta the hands of nasty bike thieves. F*%CK those guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the design, we can’t help but think that you will need to make this as inconspicuous as possible. With an easy-to-open clasp, if the would-be thieves notice it, it seems like it would be easy for them to just remove it from the bike and toss it in the bushes. But the design may also allow you to place it somewhere else on the bike that is better hidden, so get creative. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle.jpeg\"><img width=\"1151\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle.jpeg\" alt=\"Portlad Design Works Tracker Keeper under saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle.jpeg 1151w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Portlad-Design-Works-Tracker-Keeper-under-saddle-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Fastened in place under the saddle</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tracker Keeper Retail and Specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $15</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dimensions: 50x45mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 6.5g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recycled EcoPak ballistic material</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ridepdw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RidePDW.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/portland-design-works-tracker-keeper-airtag-holder/\">Thwart Bike Thievery, Stash Your AirTag with Portland Design Works’ New Tracker Keeper</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a62225057e2b577caf299a82d6c8a5d3a7a37d7eeb30612d305633ecd797c356","category":"Cycling"}
