Designed to be a “Coachella for cyclists and runners,” the weekend will feature two gravel bike rallies, a dirt jump jam, trail running races, a huge concert, onsite tent/van/rv camping, lounge pools, saunas, and local food and drink all at the gateway to the Rocky Mountains in Lyons, CO.</p>\n<p>Bohn Park will serve as the Summer Vibes Fest base camp, a beautiful park with expansive mountain views. This is the same venue as the <a href=\"https://www.oldmanwinterrally.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Winter Rally</a>, one of the country’s most popular winter cycling and running events. As Old Man Winter’s sister event, Summer Vibes will bring the same adventurous and fun spirit, but with the addition of more mountainous terrain since the Colorado winter snow will be melted. “Now that Old Man Winter Rally is well-established as an ‘epic winter adventure’, we thought it would be rad to create a summer sister event for runners and riders that combines Old Man Winter Rally with a destination music festival vibe,” explains Josh Kravetz, President of AF Events, the production company behind both events. The first edition of the Summer Vibes Festival will take place on Saturday June 21st, 2025, with camping available from 6/20-6/21.
