If your camper van or adventure rig doesn’t have a full auxiliary battery bank, then you need something portable. And the quicker it can charge, the better off you’ll be…and that’s where EcoFlow comes in.</p><p>EcoFlow’s portable power stations have tons of power, yet recharge extremely quickly, even from solar panels, thanks to LFP battery technology.</p><p>They can be tethered together to increase total output, run time, or both. That lets you run high-draw electronics like a refrigerator, coffee maker, or hair dryer. And with the R600 Pro model, you can even plug in other batteries (like those auxiliary marine-grade batteries commonly found in camper vans) and use it as an inverter.</p><p>Here’s a quick EcoFlow product overview that explains what all they can do:</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8opKqxOQaHk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>EcoFlow RIVER power pack summer sale</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging.jpg\" alt=\"ecoflow river pro high energy portable power pack for off grid\" width=\"1092\" height=\"709\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging.jpg 1092w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-297x193.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-800x519.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-120x78.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-768x499.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-696x452.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-1068x693.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-647x420.jpg 647w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1092px) 100vw, 1092px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging.jpg 1092w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-297x193.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-800x519.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-120x78.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-768x499.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-696x452.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-1068x693.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/24180350/ecoflow-river-pro-backup-power-pack-with-quick-charging-647x420.jpg 647w\"></a></p><h3>EcoFlow RIVER Pro</h3><p>The top of the line RIVER Series portalbe power station, it has a 720Wh battery that can power up to 10 devices at once directly from its onboard USB ports and three 600W AC plugs.
