Among the new features will be sleep apnea detection, which will be exclusive to the new watches. A previous report from <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1832052102790795633?s=46&amp;t=KeNv190kZok_LLb57m5tjg\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg claimed</a> that sleep apnea detection will be billed as a major new feature but “may not be available on day one of the new model going on sale.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the new sensors, Apple is also expected to improve water resistance from 50 meters to 100 meters, and “will be certified for high-speed water sports up to 20 meters deep.” It will also gain support for Apple’s Depth app, which is currently exclusive to the Apple Watch Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, 9to5Mac has learned that the Apple Watch Series 10 will get two new watch faces. The first will be called  “Reflections” and will react to ambient light, while the other is an exclusive Hermès watch face called “Regatta,” and will have a sailing theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report doesn’t mention the Apple Watch Series 3, which is also expected to be updated at the event, but it will presumably use Apple’s 3rd‑generation optical heart sensor. The current model doesn’t have an ECG sensor and it’s doubtful the 3rd-gen model will get one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a> will be unveiled at Apple’s Glowtime event on Monday alongside the iPhone 16. Along with the above features, it’s expected to have a thinner body, larger display, and new color options.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dbf127397b58f1b7bd37fc98f3b447201e11a74c7190078816397f7415dcea50","category":"Apple"}
