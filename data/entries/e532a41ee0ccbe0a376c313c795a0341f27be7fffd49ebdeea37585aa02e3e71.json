So far, so typical, as far as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> are concerned.</p>\n<p>The brand says it paid particular attention to introducing compliance to the seat tube, and the short 427mm chainstays are designed to provide a balance between comfort and responsiveness.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Ago uses a BB86 press-fit bottom bracket standard.\" title=\"_O5A7800\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cipollini has opted to use a BB86 press-fit bottom bracket standard on the Ago.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Ago uses a full monocoque carbon frame design. Rather than being constructed from tubes bonded together, Cipollini says the Ago is moulded from one piece, which the brand claims improves the frame’s strength.</p>\n<p>The frame is claimed to weigh 930g, with the fork 510g. Although Cipollini doesn’t specify a size, that certainly puts it in line with recent gravel bike releases. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/enve-mog-2023/\">ENVE’s MOG</a> frame is claimed to weigh 950g in a size 56cm and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ridley-grifn/\">Ridley Grifn</a> 990g in a size medium.</p>\n<p>The Ago’s 45mm tyre clearance is fairly middle-of-the-road compared to its rivals, with many bikes now accepting upwards of 50mm.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cipollini Ago against a wall\" title=\"Cipollini Ago against a wall\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cipollini opts for Torx mounting bolts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>In a nod to versatility, there are eyelets on the top tube and underneath the down tube, as well as triple cargo mounts on the fork. This is a trend we’ve seen on many of the latest gravel bikes, even some of those focused on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/gravel-racing/\">gravel racing</a>.</p>\n<p>The Ago can also accept <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> or a pannier rack, with an optional adaptor kit needed to run them available from Cipollini. Due to the unconventional way they fit, few options are compatible. Cipollini suggests Alumee 791 mudguards and a Tubus Tara Lowrider or Grand Tour pannier rack.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h3>What is Bike of the Week?</h3>\n<p>Every fortnight, we’ll bring you a detailed first look at one of the latest bikes (or framesets) to arrive at BikeRadar HQ – from road to commuting, gravel to enduro, and anything in between.</p>\n<p>This is our chance to introduce the bike and everything that makes it unique before hitting the road or trails.</p>\n<p>Head to our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/\">Bike of the Week hub</a> for previous editions.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<h2>A Campagnolo-heavy build</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cipollini Ago against a wall\" title=\"Cipollini Ago against a wall\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 9-42t cassette should be suitable for most conditions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Ago is available in two builds and three colours.</p>\n<p>We have the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Campagnolo Ekar</a> variant, with its catchily named ‘Carbon-White Pearl Cobalt Blue Matte’ paintjob.
