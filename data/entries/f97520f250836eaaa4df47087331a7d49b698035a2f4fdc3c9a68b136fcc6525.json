Thane sold me some 1 ml dropper bottles for carrying Aqua Mira on camping trips. The standard <a href=\"https://aquamira.com/collections/water-treatment/products/aquamira-water-treatment-1-oz\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua Mira</a> bottles are bulky – as a recovering ultralight nerd, I need to drop grams where I can.</p>\n<p>Thane even sold me a third little bottle for remixing some of the chemical water treatment. I felt so silly for not having thought to use little droppers for so long. They are amazingly useful to have in the bottom of my bag for emergency water treatment.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The second part came from my friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rustypedal/\" target=\"_blank\">Colin</a>. We were bikepacking, and I broke out my little bottles of Aqua Mira to treat some gnarly water on a trip through the Ironwood National Monument. After the trip, Colin picked up a 60-pack of the little droppers, which seemed to be the smallest quantity he could find. He gave me a handful after that trip. That’s when the light went off in my head…</p>\n<p>For years, I have been buying small droppers of fancy bike lube. They usually cost $4-6, so I don’t usually think much of it, but it all adds up. Aside from the cost, the major drawback of these tiny bottles of lube is that they aren’t translucent, so I won’t realize I’m out or nearly out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>After Colin handed me a handful of these 2 ml dropper bottles, I knew immediately I needed to make small bottles of lube for all my bikes. Each one of my bikes has some sort of bag, so these are easy to just toss in, just in case. There is no reason to ever be without lube on a ride anymore. Lately, it’s been extremely dry and dusty down in the desert and I’ve found that these little lube droppers help me and my friends stay squeak-free on rides.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The hack is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take whatever lube works best for you; you probably have a relatively large bottle around.</li>\n<li>Go in on an order of little dropper bottles with some buddies.</li>\n<li>Put the lube in the tiny dropper bottles.</li>\n<li>Use and easily refill when you use it all up!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-2-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-2-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-2-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Bike_Hacks_DIY_Mini_Lube-2-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My little bottles were sourced from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4jPrBB4\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.</a> If you want larger droppers, they seem to come in a multitude of sizes. Get a batch and make them for all your friends. Even better, when someone asks you for lube, just hand them one of your DIY lube bottles. Help all your friends and be the hero of dry and creaky drivetrains.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-hacks-mini-chain-lube-bottles/\">Bike Hacks: DIY Mini Chain Lube Bottles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f97520f250836eaaa4df47087331a7d49b698035a2f4fdc3c9a68b136fcc6525","category":"Cycling"}
