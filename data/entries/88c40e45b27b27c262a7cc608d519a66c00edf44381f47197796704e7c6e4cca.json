Iger said that Disney needs to turn its streaming business into a growth business, and one way to do that is to force households that are sharing passwords to sign up for their own accounts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/disney-plus.jpg\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1215\" />\r<br />\n\"In June, we'll be launching our first real foray into password sharing,\" said Iger. \"Just a few countries and a few markets, but then it will grow significantly with a full rollout in September.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIger did not clarify where the password sharing lockdown will start, but it sounds like it will be largely worldwide when September rolls around.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney+ competitor Netflix put a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/netflix-starts-password-sharing-crackdown/\">stop to multi-household password</a> sharing in 2023, and it ended up being a major revenue driver for the company. Netflix saw <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-pace/\">strong subscriber growth</a>, gaining 8.8 million new subscribers in Q3 2023 after cracking down on password sharing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIger said that he admires what Netflix has done, calling the company the \"gold standard in streaming.\"\r<br />\n<blockquote>Netflix is the gold standard in streaming. They've done a phenomenal job in a lot of different directions. I actually have very, very high regard for what they've accomplished. If we can only accomplish what they've accomplished, that would be great.</blockquote>\r<br />\nDisney+ launched in 2019, and since then it has grown into the number two streaming service in terms of subscribers after Netflix. Prior to when Iger returned to Disney 2022, Disney+ was bleeding money as Disney focused on subscriber growth. Disney+ will see its first profitable quarter in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 under Iger's leadership.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney's streaming service has more than 110 million subscribers worldwide, and it has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app/\">integrating Hulu content</a> into Disney+ in order to boost customer engagement. Disney+ is now priced at $10.99 per month for an ad-free subscription, or $7.99 for a subscription with ads.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown/\">Disney+ Password Sharing Crackdown to Start in June</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-password-sharing-crackdown-to-start-in-june.2423626/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88c40e45b27b27c262a7cc608d519a66c00edf44381f47197796704e7c6e4cca","category":"Apple"}
