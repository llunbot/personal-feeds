Cartoon generators spin up <i>New Yorker</i>–style illustrations and vivid anime stills. Programming and writing assistants offer shortcuts for crafting code and prose. There’s also a <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-35kDoPvW7-personal-color-analysis\">color analysis bot</a>, a <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-4X9KEo64K-spider-identifier\">spider identifier</a>, and a dating coach called <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-CsdwU23wt-rizz-gpt\">RizzGPT</a>.

The company has been embracing AI and created its own <a href=\"https://www.applai.io/blog/praxis-empowers-digital-learning-with-applai-chat\">custom chatbots</a>. But it is currently engaged in a game of whack-a-mole in the GPT Store, and Blichfeldt Andersen is the man holding the mallet.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been personally searching for infringements and reporting them,” Blichfeldt Andersen says. “They just keep coming up.” He suspects the culprits are primarily young people uploading material from textbooks to create custom bots to share with classmates—and that he has uncovered only a tiny fraction of the infringing bots in the GPT Store. “Tip of the iceberg,” Blichfeldt Andersen says.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015113#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015113&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86c7dca5c6667d0e40afefabb06571ebf41c835dfb128fb5d5d9b9c63eb2f92f","category":"Tech"}
