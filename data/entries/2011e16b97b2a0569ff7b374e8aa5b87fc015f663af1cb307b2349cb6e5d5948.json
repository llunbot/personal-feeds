The use of a stainless steel battery case also reduces the difficulty of removing the battery, which will help Apple comply with the European Union's requirements for mobile phone batteries' replaceability in the future.</blockquote>Sunway will reportedly be a major supplier of the stainless steel battery cases. If the mass production of this new battery design goes well, Kuo believes the design will be adopted across all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17 models next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup in four months, likely around mid-September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/iphone-16-pro-max-longer-battery-life/\">Kuo: iPhone 16 Pro Max Could Feature Longer Battery Life</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-16-pro-max-could-feature-longer-battery-life.2426640/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2011e16b97b2a0569ff7b374e8aa5b87fc015f663af1cb307b2349cb6e5d5948","category":"Apple"}
