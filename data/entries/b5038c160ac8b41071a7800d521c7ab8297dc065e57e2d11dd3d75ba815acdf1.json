While the cause of the fire is unknown, Tesla's Superchargers are not known for bursting into flames, and a $5,000 reward is being offered by the authorities, <a href=\"https://gearmusk.com/2025/03/04/superchargers-torched-in-ma/\">who believe the fire was</a> \"intentionally set.\" Assuming that arson is to blame, this may well be one more attack against a brand that's becoming more and more toxic.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk's involvement with US President Donald Trump has changed the nature of the spotlight on the Tesla CEO.
