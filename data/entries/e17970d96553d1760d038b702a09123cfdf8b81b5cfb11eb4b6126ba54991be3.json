Wang also reportedly told Cook that China will continue to open up and provide good services to foreign firms including Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last month <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/02/apple-1q-2023-earnings/\">released its financial results</a> for the quarter ending in December, reporting a roughly 5% decline in revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. Apple cited a \"challenging environment\" that included iPhone supply issues due to COVID lockdowns in China, which hampered its ability to ship devices to customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChina's smartphone market finished 2022 with an annual shipment of 287 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 14% and the first time since 2013 that the country's market shipment has fallen below 300 million units, according to a report by <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q4-2022\">Canalys</a>. Apple reached an all-time-high market share of 18% for the year, despite growth for the fourth quarter dropping by 24% due to supply issues, said the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been trying to diversify its supply chain outside of China to reduce its reliance on the country and mitigate the impact of geopolitical unrest, with Vietnam, and more recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/04/iphone-supplier-push-into-india/\">India</a>, emerging as important locations for supply chain expansion and investment.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/tim-cook-china-development-forum/\">Tim Cook Praises Apple's 'Symbiotic Relationship' With China During Beijing Visit</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-praises-apples-symbiotic-relationship-with-china-during-beijing-visit.2384922/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e17970d96553d1760d038b702a09123cfdf8b81b5cfb11eb4b6126ba54991be3","category":"Apple"}
