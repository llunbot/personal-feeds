Until Meta makes some big changes, it will be fined $100,000 daily for Norwegian user privacy breaches, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Datatilsynet, said yesterday.</p>\n<p>\"Meta tracks in detail the activity of users of its Facebook and Instagram platforms,\" Datatilsynet's press release said. \"Users are profiled based on where they are, what type of content they show interest in, and what they publish, amongst others. These personal profiles are used for marketing purposesâ€”so called behavioral advertising. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that the practice of Meta is illegal and is therefore imposing a temporary ban of behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram.\"</p>\n<p>Norway has not banned the apps. Its ban is focused on restricting data collection for behavioral advertising and starts August 4. The temporary ban could drag on for three months unless Meta takes remedial action sooner.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954721#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954721&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"771be27fef8d14e971a442e93b2d3e6f2c0f45900938cb9f640e0c234f2bebdf","category":"Tech"}
