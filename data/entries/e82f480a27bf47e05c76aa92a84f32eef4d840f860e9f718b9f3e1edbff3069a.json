Some people are able to easily sleep through the gentle tapping of the alarm, but a loud noise is harder to ignore. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Break Through Silent Mode option can be found by going to the Sleep app on Apple Watch, tapping on Sounds &amp; Haptics, and toggling on the setting. From there, wearing the Apple Watch to bed will cause the Apple Watch alarm to use both sound and haptic feedback to wake you up. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also turn on the Break Through Silent Mode option by opening up the Alarm app and tapping any active alarm you have set up. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nwatchOS 11.4 also includes support for Matter-compatible robot vacuum cleaners, and it solves an issue where face selection could become unresponsive when switching faces. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple provided developers with the watchOS 11.4 release candidate version today, and that represents the final version of watchOS 11.4 that will go out to the public should no additional issues be found. We're expecting watchOS 11.4 to launch in early April, as soon as next week. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/watchos-11-4-alarm-feature/\">watchOS 11.4 Will Make Sure You Don't Miss Alarms</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-4-will-make-sure-you-dont-miss-alarms.2453988/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e82f480a27bf47e05c76aa92a84f32eef4d840f860e9f718b9f3e1edbff3069a","category":"Apple"}
