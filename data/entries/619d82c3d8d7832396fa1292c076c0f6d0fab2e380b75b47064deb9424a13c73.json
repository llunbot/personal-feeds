All of the changes the ‌iPhone 16‌ models are expected to feature compared to their two direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">previously covered</a>, here on <em>MacRumors</em>.

As a result, the ‌iPhone 16‌ will be a relatively significant evolution over the ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌, featuring slightly rounded edges, a frosted glass back, and a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture. Other important design changes are expected to include the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new \"Capture\" button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 14‌</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 16‌</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Aluminum chassis with squared-off edges</td>\r<br />\n <td>Aluminum chassis with contoured edges</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Glossy glass back</td>\r<br />\n <td>Color-infused frosted glass back</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>\"Notch\" TrueDepth camera array</td>\r<br />\n <td><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Diagonally arranged rear camera array</td>\r<br />\n <td>Vertically arranged rear camera array to support spatial video capture</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Ring/Silent switch</td>\r<br />\n <td>Action Button</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>\"Capture Button\" to trigger photography and videography features</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Lightning port</td>\r<br />\n <td>USB-C port</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Displays</h3>\r<br />\nFor ‌iPhone 14‌ users, the ‌iPhone 16‌ will offer many of the display upgrades that came to the previous generation, as well as a more efficient OLED panel thanks to micro-lens technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 14‌</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 16‌</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>More efficient OLED display with brighter micro-lens technology</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>800 nits max brightness (typical)</td>\r<br />\n <td>1,000 nits max brightness (typical)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>1,200 nits peak brightness (HDR)</td>\r<br />\n <td>1,600 nits peak brightness (HDR)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>2,000 nits peak brightness (outdoor)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Cameras</h3>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌ introduced a major camera upgrade for Apple's standard smartphone lineup, bringing over the 48-megapixel camera of the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro.
