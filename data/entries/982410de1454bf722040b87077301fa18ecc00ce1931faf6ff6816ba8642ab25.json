The rest of the Lotto-Dstny team appear to be on the Noah Fast aero bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" title=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A new bike without dropped seatstays in 2023 – who would have thunk it.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike uses an aero-profiled <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a>, although this is not as thin as that seen on the Noah Fast.</p>\n<p>This is held in place via an integrated seat clamp hidden beneath a rubber bung.</p>\n<h2>A fast (and slightly unusual) build</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" title=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ewan’s bike features a long, low and narrow cockpit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The prototype Ridley appears to use the same one-piece integrated Deda cockpit as seen on the Noah Fast and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/ridley-kanzo-fast-grx-di2-classified-first-ride-review/\">Kanzo Fast gravel bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Although Ewan is running a small stack of spacers (an unusual sight on a sprinter’s bike), he more than makes up for this with a 140mm-long stem and a narrow 36cm handlebar.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" title=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ewan is using pedal extenders to increase the Q-factor of his Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 crankset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Interestingly, Ewan is running pedal extenders to slightly increase his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stance-width-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/\">Q-factor</a>.</p>\n<p>A narrower Q-factor is usually desirable as it reduces the frontal area of a rider and, for some riders, can have performance benefits.</p>\n<p>We suspect increasing the Q-factor could be to prevent heel strike issues on such a small frame, but that’s purely speculative.
