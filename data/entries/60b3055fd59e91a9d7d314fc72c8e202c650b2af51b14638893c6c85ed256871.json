Despite this, I should not have reacted in the way that I did and not so publicly,” Cavendish wrote later on social media. “I’ve been extremely close friends with my mechanics for over a decade and they’ve worked tirelessly to ensure I’ve always been safe and successful. Although they know how short I can be when I’m stressed, no-one, especially those you care about, deserve to have a voice raised to them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish’s post-stage comments came several hours after he was seen trying out a recently adjusted bike given to him by a Deceuninck-QuickStep mechanic and then banging the front of the bike onto the ground, giving the bike back, shouting his frustration, and storming onto the team bus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident was caught both on TV cameras and by roadside fans, and videos emerged on social media in the aftermath of the stage.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Det klikket for Mark Cavendish før dagens etappe i Tour de France… <a href=\"https://t.co/gxBYYn09yW\">pic.twitter.com/gxBYYn09yW</a></p>\n<p>— TV 2 Sporten (@2sporten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2sporten/status/1416072635763593217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 16, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mark Cavendish, ladies and gentlemen. <a href=\"https://t.co/lls0NyJofM\">pic.twitter.com/lls0NyJofM</a></p>\n<p>— Max Vanhove (@MaxBets001) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxBets001/status/1416078449857507333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 16, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>In his social media post addressing the incident, the 36-year-old Manxman said that he and the rest of the team had “spoken about what happened” and “would do our best to have a successful finish to” the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two stages still to go in the race – one of which is likely to end in a sprint – Cavendish is currently tied with Eddy Merckx for career Tour stage wins.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZrJRyLdVQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <p></p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZrJRyLdVQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZrJRyLdVQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZrJRyLdVQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZrJRyLdVQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZrJRyLdVQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZrJRyLdVQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Mark Cavendish (@markcavendish)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/cavendish-addresses-confrontation-with-mechanic-on-tour-stage-19/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"60b3055fd59e91a9d7d314fc72c8e202c650b2af51b14638893c6c85ed256871","category":"Cycling"}
