There's also a new feature for automatically connecting your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> through Smart ‌AirPods‌ routing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsing Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> commands, you can launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> shows in tvOS 15, and two <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> speakers can now be paired with an ‌Apple TV‌ 4K for surround sound. Those with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> cameras can view multiple cameras at the same time on the ‌Apple TV‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the SharePlay <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> feature launches later this year, the option that allows multiple people to watch TV shows or movies together will integrate with tvOS. There's even a new \"For All of You\" recommendation engine that will suggest content everyone might enjoy.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor more on tvOS 15 and the ‌Apple TV‌, we have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">dedicated roundup</a> that outlines the new features. Apple has also released a 8.4.6 update for older ‌Apple TV‌ devices. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/tvos-15-now-available/\">Apple Releases tvOS 15 With Spatial Audio, Stereo Support Using Two HomePod Minis, Hey Siri Improvements and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-tvos-15-with-spatial-audio-stereo-support-using-two-homepod-minis-hey-siri-improvements-and-more.2312052/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oRQBGypb0Qk:jWjmJfyfLdA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oRQBGypb0Qk:jWjmJfyfLdA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oRQBGypb0Qk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c6a57c64e3014d9c0a6ff43f944d8136b41cea682038f73d2e4356f18d5398cc","category":"Apple"}
