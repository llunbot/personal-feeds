For the most part, it’s focused on new features. But, every once in a while, Hammerhead will refresh the user interface – and generally speaking, it’s been very good. It feels polished and modern, albeit a bit slower these days as the Karoo 2 ages. But on the whole, people are very happy with the Karoo 2 (and rightfully so – I often use it).</p>\n<p>And then yesterday happened.</p>\n<p>Hammerhead released a new user interface refresh for the data pages specifically. The main pre-ride/post-ride menus and such have remained the same, but the new data page fields (that’s the thing you look at while riding) have changed to being a relatively minimalist layout to one that’s a bit more…boxy.</p>\n<p>And with that change, very many people were very upset about it. Last count on the Hammerhead Karoo 2 forums (a place that arguably very few Karoo 2 users actually know exists), it’s approximately 100% against, 0% in-favor. There were one or two comments that were wishy-washy, maybe in favor, but it’s plausible they may have had a few beers beforehand. Rather hard to know.</p>\n<p>So, being one to want to actually try it out before slaughtering something, I went out for a couple-hour gravel ride with it yesterday. I had pre-loaded a route, and then had all my usual data fields set up. Here’s the new setup:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image0016.jpg\"><img title=\"clip_image001[6]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image0016_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001[6]\" width=\"355\" height=\"239\" /></a> <a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image0018.jpg\"><img title=\"clip_image001[8]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image0018_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001[8]\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /></a></p>\n<p>For comparison, here’s the old UI. It’s funny, I have a gazillion photos of the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/03/hammerhead-updated-climbr-functionality-no-longer-requires-route.html/\">Karoo 2 with the CLIMBER  feature enabled</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/12/hammerhead-karoo-2-shimano-di2-workaround.html\">Shimano Di2 plug-in</a> enabled, but finding an older but not too old photo of just the generic data pages was downright impossible. So, here’s their stock photo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/Karoo2Existing.png\"><img title=\"Karoo2Existing\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/Karoo2Existing_thumb.png\" alt=\"Karoo2Existing\" width=\"722\" height=\"438\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the new user interface adds a bunch of boxes around everything. Whereas the old user interface was more flat and minimalized.</p>\n<p>And here’s the thing, during my two hours riding – the new user interface was not my biggest problem. My actual biggest problem was not checking the tides before doing a beach ride, and then finding out it was precisely (to the minute) high-tide. Meaning it was a soft-sand slog.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image0014.jpg\"><img title=\"clip_image001[4]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image0014_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001[4]\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, even then, the new user interface actually didn’t bother me that much. But, there is, I think, one important difference: I have mine set for ‘dark’ mode. In other words, white text on black background, as you can see. Also, in the above photos, taken with less brightness, – the middle sections kinda disappear. Whereas in the photos after this, I cranked up the brightness level, and these dead-grey spaces became more obvious.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00110.jpg\"><img title=\"clip_image001[10]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00110_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001[10]\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>\n<p>In that realm, the boxes aren’t quite so in-your-face. Whereas most of the complaints seem to be centered on the ‘light’ mode, where it’s black text on a black background, as such.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00114.jpg\"><img title=\"clip_image001[14]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00114_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001[14]\" width=\"720\" height=\"486\" /></a></p>\n<p>For that, I did a trainer ride today. But here’s a prettier outside picture with the light mode on, to make them more similar:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00116.jpg\"><img title=\"clip_image001[16]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00116_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001[16]\" width=\"355\" height=\"239\" /></a> <a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00118.jpg\"><img title=\"clip_image001[18]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/clip_image00118_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001[18]\" width=\"355\" height=\"234\" /></a></p>\n<p>And in that lighter mode, yeah, honestly, it looks hideously dated. Why is there all that empty grey space?</p>\n<p>A few people mentioned it reminding them of Bryton. But I’d go even further and say it reminds me of Mio bike computers from at least a decade ago. Here’s that for reference (from a <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2012/08/an-early-hands-on-look-at-mios-new-ant.html\">post in August 2012</a>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/MioBikeComputer.jpg\"><img title=\"MioBikeComputer\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/06/MioBikeComputer_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"MioBikeComputer\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" /></a></p>\n<p>Do I think there are worse offenses? Sure, I suppose. I mean, they could have removed ANT+ or something.</p>\n<p>But yeah, the ‘light’ mode user interface is not at all my favorite. Either way, I had no real issues using the dark-mode UI during my ride, it worked perfectly fine and didn’t bother me one way or the other.</p>\n<p>Hammerhead has responded to the criticism in a <a href=\"https://support.hammerhead.io/hc/en-us/community/posts/16007939814939/comments/16053763910171\">comment on their forum</a>, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thanks for providing your feedback on the new look of the data-fields.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While these may not be solving all the problems, but we assure you that we are moving in a direction that we believe would make our product stronger and better for our riders in the long term. The changes are fundamental to significant improvements coming down the line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We understand that some of the real concerns are around shrinking of the data values and contrast of the background.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We have heard your feedback and are investigating how to make some of this adjustable. Thanks again!!</p>\n<p> </p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, in kinda unrelated news – Hammerhead has significantly discounted their Karoo 2 units, down 35% to $259 (normally $399)–  the lowest price it’s ever been (by a ton). Obviously, they didn’t exactly aim to have the news coverage of their sale come by way of an internet revolt about their user interface. As for whether or not a Karoo 3 is in the works? Who knows. Certainly I think Hammerhead/SRAM is overdue for one – but they’re fast approaching the cutoff for when it makes sense to launch a new bike computer (ideally June or earlier), else you miss the summer season. Certainly there’s many years of past bike computers being launched mid-summer or later summer, but the general trend is towards the May/early-June timeframe.</p>\n<p>In any case, I still think the Karoo 2 is a fantastic unit – and especially so at $259USD. I’m sure Hammerhead will sort things out, since they do tend to be known for listening to customer feedback. Till then, I’ll just keep on keepin’ on with dark mode.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p><div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
