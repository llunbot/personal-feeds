They fulfill a somewhat upper echelon in the Cross lineup, while the existing models (all other <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/porsche-ebike-sport-ebike-cross-updates/\" target=\"_blank\">Crosses, and the Sport line</a>) also received upgrades, the company said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC-800x529.jpg\" alt=\"Porsche eBike Cross Performance EXC, studio image\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC-800x529.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC-768x507.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC-1536x1015.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Porsche-eBike-Cross-Performance-EXC.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Ruby Star Neo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Porsche Cross Performance &amp; Cross Performance EXC</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Porsche didn’t spare any expense when it comes to hardware for its two new eBike models.
