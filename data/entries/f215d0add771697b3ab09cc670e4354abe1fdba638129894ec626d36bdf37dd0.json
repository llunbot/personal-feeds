Simply, they are a nice pair of light and adjustable sandals. Loosen the straps a bit and I was wearing them around the house with socks, first after riding, then pretty much everyday. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc x Restrap Sandals, adventure gravel bikepacking post-ride shoes, footsies\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_feet-pics.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When the weather warmed up a bit and the sun came out, the socks went away immediately after the ride and I could tighten the straps down for a more secure fit making the sandals suitable for something that leaned more towards light hiking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now with the rear strap pivoted up (<em>like in the Tech video above</em>), I can wear them as slides, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc x Restrap Sandals, adventure gravel bikepacking post-ride shoes, sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_sole.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The sole felt thin at first when I put them on, mostly because they really just feel a lot lighter than other sandals that I regularly wear. But I quickly settled into them and now appreciate the textured (but generally flat) footbed, a little bit of shock absorption walking over rough surfaces, and the simple but grippy outer tread.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_quick-release-buckle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_quick-release-buckle-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc x Restrap Sandals, adventure gravel bikepacking post-ride shoes, quick release buckle detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_quick-release-buckle-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_quick-release-buckle-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_quick-release-buckle-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_quick-release-buckle-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_quick-release-buckle.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real bikepacking-specific feature is the clip-on mid-foot strap, which is certainly nice, but a bit tricky to use. With two hands you can pop open the buckle, then clip the two sandals together, and if you adjust the velcro you can wrap the linked shoes around your saddle pack. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Quoc x Restrap Sandals, adventure gravel bikepacking post-ride shoes, clipped together\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quoc-x-Restrap-Sandals_adventure-gravel-bikepacking-post-ride-shoes_strapped-together.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for myself, the sandals are light enough that I will probably just put them on top of the pack most of the time, with the pack bungee cord looped through the sandal straps for security, then I can keep the velcro set where I like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All-in-all, I’m happy with the comfort, lightweight &amp; versatility of the Quoc x Restrap bikepacking sandals, and I’m regularly wearing them not just around bikes.
