It’s had a similar effect on my colleagues too, for this week has been a vintage one for content on cyclist.co.uk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stream of new product launches, which continues to flow with abundance, was the source of plenty of our published articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NoPinz launched a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/gravel-skinsuit-nopinz\" target=\"_blank\">gravel skinsuit</a>, Cannondale added a fancy <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-lab71-topstone\" target=\"_blank\">Lab71 option to its Topstone gravel bike range</a>, Specialized lopped the bottom half of its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/specialized-sirrus-carbon\" target=\"_blank\">Sirrus commuter bike</a>’s seat tube off to give it a ‘Compliance Junction’, Canyon revealed it’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/canyon-titanium-bike\" target=\"_blank\">dabbling in 3D printed titanium</a>, Kask revised its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/kask-utopia-y-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">Utopia helmet</a> and DT Swiss made updates to its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/dt-swiss-crc-1400-spline-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">CRC wheel line</a> too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re supporting the tech news with some big ol’ reviews too: Cyclist web editor Matthew Loveridge tested <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized’s Diverge STR</a> and mag deputy editor James Spender’s review of the Cervélo S5 will be published later on today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given we’re peak Spring Classics season and the Tour of Flanders is this weekend, our pro coverage was pretty good as well. We ran the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-gent-wevelgem\" target=\"_blank\">latest edition of our Pro Log series</a>, took a peek <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-classics-tomas-van-den-spiegel\" target=\"_blank\">behind the scenes at Flanders</a>, looked at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">riders that should be in the mix</a> for this year’s race, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-johan-museeuw\" target=\"_blank\">got Johan Museeuw’s perspective on it too</a> and published Classic Climbs features on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/koppenberg-tour-of-flanders\" target=\"_blank\">Koppenberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oude-kwaremont-tour-of-flanders\" target=\"_blank\">Oude Kwaremont</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paterberg-tour-of-flanders-classic-climb\" target=\"_blank\">Paterberg</a> to boot. What a bunch of busy bees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the week wouldn’t be complete without an edition of our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/in-the-drops\" target=\"_blank\">In the Drops</a> weekly round-up, so here is some of the best kit to arrive with us over the few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pas Normal Studios Escapism gravel kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pas Normal Studios kit\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-14.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pas Normal Studios caters unusually well for gravel riding in its comprehensive Escapism collection.

However, they don’t play well with tubeless – more often than not, you need to remove the valve core to allow enough airflow through them in order to seat the tyre, and they’re liable to clogging with sealant too, sooner or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7-970x650.jpg\" alt=\"Reserve Fillmore valves\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7-970x650.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7-750x503.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7-1140x764.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-7.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Reserve</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In its Fillmore design, Reserve aims to sidestep the Presta valve’s potential flaws. It does away with the cramped valve core that sits inside the valve stem, instead using a thin rod that extends down through the valve stem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The valve itself is formed right at the stem’s base: pushing down on the rod shifts the poppet on the end of it away from the base of the valve stem, opening a port through which air and sealant can enter the tyre cavity more readily.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Reserve Fillmore valves\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/in-the-drops-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reserve is claiming up to three times more airflow for its Fillmore design and say the design is impervious to clogging too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the valve cap is natty.

It’s tricky and unpredictable and can rely on a fair degree of luck, despite your performance still being ultimately governed by skill and determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if you play badly, who cares? You’ve just hit the ball into the mouth of a giant duck – the number of strokes it took you to do so can easily become irrelevant if you want it to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crazy golf also removes many of proper golf’s perceived disadvantages too. It doesn’t take five hours to finish the game, you don’t return home physically and mentally drained and sunburnt, the necessary ability level to play is much lower and you don’t even have to wear chinos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, it’s family friendly – kids and partners are likely to enjoy it just as much as you are, perhaps even more so when your son has just sunk a hole in one and you’re three shots deep and still nowhere even close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m aware that I’m writing for an audience of cyclists, so stick with me: a lot of parallels can be drawn between the two sports. Cycling, just like real golf, can be pretty exclusive, time-consuming and serious, but as there isn’t really a cycling equivalent of crazy golf (BMX is probably too dangerous for most, myself included), I think it’s a pretty valid option if you need to lighten the mood once in a while.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pas-normal-studios-escapism-jersey\">In the Drops: Reserve’s genius tubeless valves, Pas Normal Studios gravel kit, a neat backpack from Chrome and crazy golf</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Challis &#124; Tech Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"164d59bbd438eec27ebe53d5dbb7790e9c6094abba277e93926858c4a813e2ef","category":"Cycling"}
