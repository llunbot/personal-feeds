The reliability of each source varies, so some of the rumored features may be taken with a pinch of salt.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, the overall view of the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ rumors gives a good idea of many of the upcoming upgrades and what users can largely expect from the true wireless earbuds when they are officially revealed in the near future.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>AirPods Pro-like design</strong> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">shorter stems</a> and a larger in-ear shell.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Shorter, wider charging case</strong>, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">similar design to the AirPods Pro's charging case</a>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>No replaceable ear tips</strong>, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">images of early Chinese counterfeits</a> that show no sign of silicone tips nor any space for them within the charging case. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">initially claimed last year</a> that the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ would feature replaceable ear tips like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, but this is now questionable in light of the design of the counterfeits and other purported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/leaked-renders-for-third-gen-airpods/\">supply-chain renders</a>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Next-generation wireless chip</strong>, replacing the Apple H1 headphone chip. It is the same chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">expected to</a> come to the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌, will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/23/kuo-airpods-third-gen-first-half-2020/\">smaller System-in-Package</a> and could offer improved efficiency, longer range, and better performance.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Force sensor controls</strong> on the stems <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">like the AirPods Pro</a>, replacing the tap-based controls of the first and second-generation ‌AirPods‌.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Pressure relief system</strong> with vents brought over from the ‌AirPods Pro‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/\">designed to equalize pressure</a> within the ear to relieve discomfort when using the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ for a long period of time.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Charging case with Qi wireless charging</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">as standard</a>, with no need to upgrade to a higher-spec charging case.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt would also not be unreasonable to expect the next-generation ‌AirPods‌ to feature improved sound quality and better battery life, but there have been no rumors about these aspects thus far.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe entry-level ‌AirPods‌ are expected to continue to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">forgo higher-end features</a> such as Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency to remain clearly differentiated from the ‌AirPods Pro‌. This may also explain the continued absence of in-ear silicone tips.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/26/airpods-2-hands-on/\">second-generation AirPods</a> launched in March 2019, making them almost two and a half years old. If these new features do come to the third-generation ‌AirPods‌, the new model could shape up to be a worthwhile upgrade for many users. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\"><em>52audio</em> believes</a> that the new ‌‌AirPods‌‌ will be priced at $150.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/iphone-13-launch-sept-17-chinese-report/\">Most indications</a> seem to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/23/when-is-iphone-13-release-date/\">pointing to Tuesday, September 14</a> as the most likely event date for the announcement of the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/airpods-3-with-iphone-13-event/\">and iPhone 13 models</a>, and we could see event invites go out as soon as next week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/full-airpods-3-feature-breakdown/\">Full AirPods 3 Feature Breakdown: Everything Rumors Say We Can Expect</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/full-airpods-3-feature-breakdown-everything-rumors-say-we-can-expect.2309535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-Q-PmAzMmtw:_M7RFzFoQLU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-Q-PmAzMmtw:_M7RFzFoQLU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-Q-PmAzMmtw\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"33e4e275f555a625a0764986690e9842964865792e69d4ba88d1f16dd7c24c98","category":"Apple"}
