A new assistant offers Mac health and security reports and maintenance reminders, while an updated My Clutter module helps users manage storage by identifying large, old, and duplicate files.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther changes include grouped application permissions in the Protection module for easier privacy management, and a redesigned menu bar utility that aims to improve system monitoring and resource usage.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"This update isn't just about a fresh look â€” it's about giving users the tools they need to care for their Macs effortlessly,\" said MacPaw CEO Oleksandr Kosovan. \"We're combining smart tech with an intuitive design, setting the stage for better security, faster performance, and a cleaner, clutter-free experience.\"</blockquote>The new CleanMyMac is available as a subscription starting at $39.95 per year or as a one-time purchase from $119.95 (prices may vary by region). Existing CleanMyMac and Setapp subscribers will receive the upgrade for free, while previous one-time license owners can upgrade with up to a 50% discount.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Mockup03-Smart-Care-Scan-Result-EN.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nMacPaw plans to add more features in 2025, including improvements to storage visualization and file organization.
