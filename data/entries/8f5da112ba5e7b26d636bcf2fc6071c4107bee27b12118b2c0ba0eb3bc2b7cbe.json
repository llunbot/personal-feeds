At that point, V.N. had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/us-woman-headed-to-jail-for-refusing-tb-treatment-for-over-a-year/\">spent a year and half ignoring monthly court orders</a> to have her tuberculosis case treated and/or isolate at home to keep from spreading her infection to others in the community. She also spent <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/05/fugitive-with-untreated-tuberculosis-continues-to-stump-law-enforcement/\">about three months on the lam</a>, actively evading law enforcement as they tried to execute a March 2, 2023, civil arrest warrant. During that time, she was seen <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/woman-with-untreated-tb-is-on-the-lam-took-city-bus-to-casino/\">taking a city bus to a local casino</a> and seemingly hid from law enforcement after that.</p>\n<p>She was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/woman-with-untreated-tb-finally-in-custody-held-in-negative-pressure-room/\">eventually apprehended at her home</a> without incident on June 1, Pierce County Sheriff’s spokesperson Sgt. Darren Moss told Ars at the time. Deputies booked her into a negative pressure room in the Pierce County Jail, where she would get her court-ordered tuberculosis treatment without risk to others in the facility.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950406#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950406&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f5da112ba5e7b26d636bcf2fc6071c4107bee27b12118b2c0ba0eb3bc2b7cbe","category":"Tech"}
