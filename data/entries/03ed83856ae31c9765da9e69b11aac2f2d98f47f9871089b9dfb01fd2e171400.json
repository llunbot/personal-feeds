Sonar is music to my ears: a brand-new totally Mac-assed app for GitHub and GitLab issues.</p>\n\n<p>Sonar combines the lightweight UI of a to-do app with the power of enterprise-level issue tracking, all in a native app built by long-time Mac nerds. The interface is deceptively simple, and very intuitive. Fast and fluid too. Everything that’s great about native Mac apps is exemplified by Sonar. If you’ve ever thought, “Man, if only Apple made a native GitHub client...”, you should run,  not walk, to download it.</p>\n\n<p>Sonar saves all your changes directly to GitHub/GitLab using their official APIs, so your data remains secure on GitHub’s servers — not Sonar’s. Do you have team members not using Sonar? No problem. Changes you make in Sonar are 100% compatible with the web UI.</p>\n\n<p>Sonar is free to try for 14 days — no subscriptions or purchases required. Sonar is my favorite new Mac app of the year. You should try it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/25/sonar\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"03ed83856ae31c9765da9e69b11aac2f2d98f47f9871089b9dfb01fd2e171400","category":"Tech"}
