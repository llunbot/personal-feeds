Possible rivals in China include Xiaomi, Redmi, and vivo. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nStarting at $599, the iPhone 16e was released in late February. The iPhone 16e offers a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, and a USB-C port, positioning it as a more affordable alternative within the iPhone 16 family. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nA day before the iPhone 16e was launched, Fixed Focus Digital claimed to have learned of the existence of a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/leaker-hints-at-iphone-17e-next-year/\">new project codename</a>\" in Apple's supply chain, and suggested there was a \"high chance\" it related to next year's iPhone 17e. Fixed Focus Digital was the first leaker to mention the \"iPhone 16e\" nomenclature back in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e/\">December</a>, when everyone else still assumed Apple would simply release a new device in its established entry-level \"iPhone SE\" series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA February report by <a href=\"https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/predicting-iphone-16e-market-reception\">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)</a> said Apple was expected to release an iPhone 17e next year, but the report suggested another February launch window for the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroducing a more affordable mid-cycle \"e\" model could help Apple refresh its flagship lineup and generate more consumer interest than simply re-releasing the standard iPhone in a new color â€“ a strategy the company has used in the past. Buyers would also have a better idea of when to expect the next entry-level device, in contrast to the non-linear roadmap that succeeding iPhone SE models followed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/apple-q1-smartphone-market-top-spot/\">recent data</a> from Counterpoint Research, Apple took the number one position in global smartphone sales during the first quarter of 2025, with Apple benefiting from the iPhone 16e launch and strong performance in emerging markets. It's the first time Apple has taken the top spot during a first quarter, capturing 19% of the global market.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17e-trial-production-launch-late-may/\">iPhone 17e Nears Trial Production, Launch Tipped for Late May 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17e-nears-trial-production-launch-tipped-for-late-may-2026.2455740/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a1296661574207cadfa683d37132407558776b6bc6665a21758c899da01ff06","category":"Apple"}
