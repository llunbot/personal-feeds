NBC will air a special on Sunday evening featuring current and former cast members.</p>\n<p>I've long been a big fan of the show, since I was a kid in the late 1980s watching cast members such as Phil Hartman, Dana Carvey, and Jan Hooks. By then, the show was more than a decade old. It had already spawned huge Hollywood stars like Chevy Chase and Eddie Murphy and had gone through some near-death experiences as it struggled to find its footing.</p>\n<p>The show most definitely does not appeal to some people. When I asked the Ars editorial team to share their favorite sketches, a few writers told me they had never found <em>Saturday Night Live</em> funny, hadn't watched it in decades, or just did not get the premise of the show. Others, of course, love the show's ability to poke fun at the cultural and political zeitgeist of the moment.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/02/after-50-years-ars-staffers-pick-their-favorite-saturday-night-live-sketches/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/02/after-50-years-ars-staffers-pick-their-favorite-saturday-night-live-sketches/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b9d0f0600ed81bb8b6cec0f749c732d145d23ee729a8cf69b8eae4f32fc4941","category":"Tech"}
