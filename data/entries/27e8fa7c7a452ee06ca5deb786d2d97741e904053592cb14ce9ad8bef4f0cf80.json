The Portland, Oregon venue in the Zidell Barge Building is nestled in an old ship manufacturing yard and is evidence of a bygone era. Cranes and mechanical armatures tower overhead and huge steel joists span across the space, with years of dust and grime clinging to each rivet and bolt. Underfoot, the concrete floor is stained from a century of industry and the bright sun barely penetrates the skylights, yellowed from age.<span></span></em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-110.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-109.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-BIke-Show-People-and-Product-125.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Within each of the bays rest vestiges from the Pacific Northwest’s industrialized peak: band saws, electrical panels, metal tanks, stacks of sheet metal, and other obsolete remnants.

From fillet-brazed beauts, lugged frames made to flex and plane, to high-tech modern carbon production, we saw cargo bikes, fast bikes, slow bikes, concept bikes and more. Adjacent to these makers were the producers of accessories; bags, bells, components, wheels, apparel. You could smell the aluminum chips flying off the CNC mills, the anodizing baths, and the blood, sweat, and tears each person had poured into their work.</p>\n<p>Actually <em>making</em> products in the country of design origin will never be easy. As such, the makers that congregated in Portland last week are outliers of the bike industry. Artists giving life to their ideals by building unique and utilitarian vehicles to carry their owners on journeys long and far. The drive to produce by hand has come in packages large and small since the first humans crafted tools from rock, bone, and wood.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-People-and-Products-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This drive, motivation, and desire to shape not only the bike industry but the world itself through handmade objects is inseparable from the human condition, and celebrating these feats is always worth our effort here.</p>\n<p>MADE was the best bike show I’ve ever been to. The venue was stunning, the people welcoming, and the crowd diverse. The forces within have motivated me to spend the last almost 18 years of my life documenting their work with a passion. I built this very website as a venue of celebration, and MADE was a reminder that every bit of energy released into this world comes back with a massive return on investment.</p>\n<p>As Josh and I spent five solid days shooting bikes from sun up to sun down, we both walked away exhausted but excited. It felt like a family reunion.
