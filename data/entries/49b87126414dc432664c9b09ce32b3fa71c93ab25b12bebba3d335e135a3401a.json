{"title":"A Prototype Original iPod","link":"https://panic.com/blog/a-prototype-original-ipod/","date":1635283863000,"content":"\n<p>Cabel Sasser, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first iPod:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now, there are a lot of mysteries in the Panic Archives (it’s a\ncloset) but by far one of the most mysterious is what you’re\nseeing for the first time today: an original early iPod prototype.</p>\n\n<p>We don’t know much about where it came from. But we’ve been\nwaiting 20 years to share it with you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It doesn’t look <em>anything</em> like an actual iPod, but that’s how prototypes work. But the date on this unit was remarkably late in development:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Clearly, this revision of the prototype was <em>very</em> close to the\ninternals of the finished iPod. In fact, the date there — September 3rd, 2001 — tells us this one was made barely two\nmonths before it was introduced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve long wondered whether Apple might have intended to introduce the iPod a few weeks earlier than they actually did, but, well, September 11 happened. I remember that original iPod introduction as much for the iPod itself as for it feeling like a welcome early step in the world returning to normalcy. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/1451969239359926276\">Tony Fadell</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is a P68/Dulcimer iPod prototype we (very quickly) made\nbefore the true form factor design was ready. Didn’t want it look\nlike an iPod for confidentiality - the buttons placement, the size\n- it was mostly air inside - and the wheel worked (poorly).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnwhitley/status/1451951148697468933\">John Whitley</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>@panic @cabel HA! GOT YOU! I have seen <em>exactly</em> that before. I\nwas one of the PortalPlayer firmware devs who went onsite @ the\nApple skunkworks site during iPod main development, and again to\nmake sure the GM release shipped on time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/26/prototype-original-ipod\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"49b87126414dc432664c9b09ce32b3fa71c93ab25b12bebba3d335e135a3401a","category":"Tech"}
