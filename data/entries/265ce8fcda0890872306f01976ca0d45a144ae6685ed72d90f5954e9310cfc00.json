First, you will receive up to 15% credit on the original price of the product you’re returning. Velocio bases the amount of credit given “on the condition of the item and its original retail value.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they cannot determine the original MSRP, they will credit you $7. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, another important note is that Velocio determines the condition of what you send back. If an item is in poor condition, “you will not receive a gift card and your item <strong>will not be</strong> returned to you” (emphasis added). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if it is in super rough shape, maybe don’t send it back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While any apparel applies, there are a few things excluded. Velocio “cannot accept the following items: socks, gloves, shoe covers, hats, warmers, water bottles, stickers, tote bags, items from other brands, or items made in collaboration with other brands.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocio also deducts $10 from your credit (see the photos) to cover shipping the items back to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, there are some exceptions, but it is a cool way to get discounted Velocio gear, and could be a great way into some new sizes if you’ve bulked up or slimmed down. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/veolcio-offers-up-to-15-percent-off-when-you-trade-in-old-apparel/\">Don’t Throw Away Your Old Velocio Gear…Trade it in</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Reill","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"265ce8fcda0890872306f01976ca0d45a144ae6685ed72d90f5954e9310cfc00","category":"Cycling"}
