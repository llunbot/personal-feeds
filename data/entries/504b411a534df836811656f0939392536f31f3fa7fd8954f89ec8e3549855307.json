So you’ll only have time to quickly brew an espresso (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/coffee-and-cycling-what-you-need-to-know/\">the only coffee you should drink while cycling</a>), answer the doorbell or refill your bottles before getting back in the saddle.</p>\n<h2>Action Bar restructure</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift has tried to make the Action Bar easier to navigate.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>In the summer, Zwift will divide its Action Bar (used to control in-game features) into sub menus. This removes the need to scroll to the far left or right to give a Ride On or perform a U-turn.</p>\n<p>For example, the emote sub menu brings all the reactions – from toast to wave – to one place.</p>\n<h2>Group riding and racing features</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Staying put or moving up in a group should now be more natural.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The Keep Everyone Together feature will be available this summer for club events. This allows any Zwifter who is a club administrator to turn on the virtual elastic band for any club ride. It was previously only possible to use it in certain events.</p>\n<p>With the new Rider Teleport feature, you can catch up with a mate who joins the same virtual world as you without ending your current activity. You can also teleport between RoboPacers of different speeds. For example, you could warm up with a slower RoboPacer before jumping to a faster speed.</p>\n<p>Zwift also claims its refined Pack Dynamics make riding in a group more lifelike. It says you won’t be overtaken so easily or get sucked into a pack if you’re riding solo.</p>\n<p>What’s more, it’s now easier to hold your position in a group, drop to the back or break away off the front, according to Zwift.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Keep tabs on your rivals with the Player Highlight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Player Highlight feature will arrive this summer. This suspends a glowing halo over your avatar and that of Zwifters you follow.</p>\n<p>Zwift says this helps you pick out yourself, friends and the ride leader in large groups. The halo fades in smaller groups and disappears when you’re riding on your own. Zwift says Player Highlight is useful when a peloton of riders are wearing the same jersey.</p>\n<h2>Climb Portal</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The portal will transport you into the virtual French Alps.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The Climb Portal will give virtual access to some of cycling’s most iconic climbs.</p>\n<p>From its launch this summer, Zwifters who ride through the Climb Portal will be to scale simulations of the Col du Tourmalet and Col D’Aspin. More mountains will follow.</p>\n<h2>New challenges and sessions</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift says these workouts will help get you into summer shape.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The Zwift Spring Training Series contains “six effective, efficient, achievable workouts that will get you ready for all your summer goals”, according to the brand.
