But what about those times when you need faster direction straight from your phone? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/QuickNav-Hero-GIF.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1350\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/QuickNav-Hero-GIF.gif\" alt=\"Ride With GPS Quick Nav\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To find the safest, most bike-friendly route possible, Ride with GPS has just rolled out their QuickNav feature. Available in both the iOS and Android RwGPS app, QuickNav gives you multiple ways to get directions. If you know the name of the destination, simply tap it into the search bar and it will generate a route including the estimated time to the destination. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Long-Press-to-Set-Destination.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1350\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Long-Press-to-Set-Destination.gif\" alt=\"Ride With GPS Quick Nav\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not sure of the name but know where you want to go? You can long-press on the map and get the same result. If you venture off route, the navigation will automatically update your route in real-time. And if you change your mind, you can open the app and input a new destination at any time, with the route and ETA adjusting accordingly. QuickNav also allows you to set a home location so you can quickly pull up the most cycling-friendly route home at any time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users.png\" alt=\"Ride With GPS Quick Nav\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users.png 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Live-Activity-for-iOS-Users-720x480.png 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the feature is available for free to all users, regardless of subscription level.
