We have investigated every rumor and trend we could find to bring you our predictions. Read on to find out what could be in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update November 2024:</strong> <em>Apple has released M4 versions of the iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro as it wraps up its 2024 product launches.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What new Apple products arrived in 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released the following new products in 2024:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple launched the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> headset in the U.S. on February 2. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a> launched on March 4.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2325767/11-13-inch-ipad-air-m2-display-camera-storage.html\">M2 iPad Air</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324814/11-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-neural-engine-design-landscape-camera.html\">M4 iPad Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2326113/apple-pencil-pro-m4-m2-ipad-air-pro-features-price-compatibility.html\">Apple Pencil Pro</a> all launched on May 7.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html\">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a> launched on September 9.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html\">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> launched on September 9.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a> launched on September 9.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">AirPods 4</a> launched on September 9 and new colors for the AirPods Max were introduced.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini A17 Pro</a> launched on October 15. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple launched the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2423527/m4-imac-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">M4 iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html\">MacBook Pro</a> the week of October 28.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the M3 has been supplanted by the M4, we’ll have to wait for the Mac Studio and Mac Pro to get their updates next year. With 2024 wrapped up, what else is coming in 2025?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the sections below we’ve split products into categories including Mac, iPad, iPhone, and some new product categories. Read on to find out what to expect at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple next event</a>, throughout the rest of the year, and in 2025.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the first M4 Macs have arrived, our attention turns to the models that still have M3 processors. It looks like Apple will update all of its products with M4 chips for the first time. Here’s when you can expect the remaining M3 models to make the switch:<em> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 MacBook Air</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s popular laptop is expected to get an M4 chip in spring 2025. However, Apple did update the current base models with 8GB of RAM to 16GB of RAM in late October with the arrival of the M4 MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update is expected to be little more than a chip refresh. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air M4 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Studio </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Studio will bypass the M3 chip and jump straight to the M4 Max and M4 Ultra, making customers wait about two years between updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear what else Apple has planned for the Mac Studio than a new chip. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M4 Mac Studio rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? June <em><em><em>2025</em></em></em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Mac Studio is getting an update with the M4 Max and M4 Ultra you can rest assured that the Mac Pro will too, likely in spring 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple didn’t change the design of the Mac Pro when it got its first Apple silicon update, the only Mac that still has the old design following the M4 Mac mini overhaul. We don’t expect Apple to change anything with the M4 update either. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">M4 Mac Pro rumors.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? June <em><em><em>2025</em></em></em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 iMac delivered some new color hues, but it still has a 24-inch screen. Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac way back in 2022 when the Studio Display arrived, and there have been rumors ever since that Apple is working on a new large-screen iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is said to be working on a new “Pro” version of the iMac, a return of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a> perhaps, or even larger. There are enough rumors to believe that Apple is indeed working on such an iMac, though it’s unclear whether it will arrive in 2025 or later. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Larger iMac Pro rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Maybe October 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPads</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4315300_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>No iPads were updated in 2023 – the first time a year passed without an iPad update. Almost the whole range got a refresh in 2024, with the new iPad Air and iPad Pro in May and the iPad mini in October. But there’s still one model remaining:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>11th-gen iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th gen iPad joined the lineup in October 2022 so a new model is somewhat overdue. As such, the 10th-gen iPad is the only model that doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, so the next update will likely give it the same A17 Pro chip used by the 2024 iPad mini.

A supposed leak revealed a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2254092/iphone-se-4-cad-leak-6-1-inch-screen-face-id-notch-camera.html\">bigger screen, notch, and Face ID</a>, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first we’ve heard of a bigger version of the iPhone SE. The question is, will it still feature the Home button? Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674037/iphone-se-plus-postponed-until-2021.html\">iPhone SE Plus</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE rumors</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 17 won’t arrive until September 2025, but there are already rumors about them. Apple is expected to introduce a new model, the iPhone 17 Air, that brings a fresh design and new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 202</em>5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max and AirPods Pro have had the odd update since they launched a few years ago, but the next generation has yet to materialize. Will they get a full update in 2025?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait for new AirPods Pro could stretch beyond 2025. They could offer new health-related features when they arrive. As for the AirPods Max, now that Apple’s refreshed the colors it’s unlikely to do anything else for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 arrived in September 2024, with a larger screen, but there was no generational update for the Apple Watch Ultra or the Apple Watch SE. Apple will surely release a new Apple Watch in 2025 along with new Apple Watch Ultra and SE models. Some reports say Apple could move the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2458604/a-plastic-apple-watch-se-is-still-coming-next-year.html\">Apple Watch SE launch</a> to spring.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2025 (and possibly March 2025 for the SE)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2023, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod with screen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker and control the HomePod via an iPhone (which can be a drain on the battery).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 2025</em></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp\" alt=\"HomePod with iPad screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>A HomePod that combines the screen of an iPad could be on the cards.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vision Pro successor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro is pricy and a little cumbersome, but Apple is said to be at work on two updated models: a less-expensive version, and another high-end model. Perhaps “Vision Pro 2” and “Vision Air?” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2489500/apples-vision-of-the-future-four-new-products-in-the-works.html\">four new AR/VR products</a> coming in 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.  These could include a cheaper Vision Pro model (at $2,000). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 2025 or later</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple released in 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hit the ground running in 2023 with new Macs and a new HomePod in January. Then at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC</a> in June the company launched no less than three new Macs and a brand new device – the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> – alongside revealing its plans for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS 14 Sonoma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 10</a>. Finally (maybe) Apple launched the new iPhone 15 series and the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/no-new-ipad-air-mini-pro-2023.html\">event</a> in September and then made macOS Sonoma and iOS 17 available for customers to download later that month. Then at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">Apple event on October 30</a> the company unveiled new MacBook Pro and iMac models.
