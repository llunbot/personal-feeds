Laid off employees will have 60 days to find another job in the company before it cuts ties with them altogether, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>\n<p>Compared to some other big tech companies, layoffs are relatively uncommon at Apple. This is the fourth wave this year, but cuts so far (including this one) have been laser-focused and small in scopeâ€”a contrast with companies like Intel, Cisco, or Microsoft, which have recently made more drastic cuts of anywhere from 7 to 15 percent of their workforces.</p>\n<p>The current set of cuts chiefly affects the Books team.
