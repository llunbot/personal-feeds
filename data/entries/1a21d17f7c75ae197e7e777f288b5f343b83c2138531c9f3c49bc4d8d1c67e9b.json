The site found that some blue colors cause HDR highlights to blow out and appear nearly white, a defect that can be spotted in the form of compression artifacts in sample images.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/imore-ipad-pro-compression-issue.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"844\" /><em><div>Image via <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/ipad/ipad-pro/exclusive-ipad-pro-oled-display-has-a-weird-hdr-highlights-bug-apple-is-trying-to-squash\">iMore</a></div></em><blockquote>In a relatively specific set of circumstances, HDR highlights are blown out on certain blue shades including navy and indigo to a point that they almost appear white on screen.

It's also a bug that is hard to spot most of the time, and there's no clear reason why it's happening.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple told <em>iMore</em> that it is aware of the issue and is working on a software update to fix it.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/oled-ipad-pro-hdr-bug/\">HDR Bug Impacts OLED iPad Pro, Apple Working on Software Fix</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hdr-bug-impacts-oled-ipad-pro-apple-working-on-software-fix.2426236/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1a21d17f7c75ae197e7e777f288b5f343b83c2138531c9f3c49bc4d8d1c67e9b","category":"Apple"}
