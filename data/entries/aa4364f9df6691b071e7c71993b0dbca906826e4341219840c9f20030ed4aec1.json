Direct to Apple Watch has been one of our most requested features and we're thrilled to roll it out to Dexcom G7 users in the U.S. and around the world,\" said Jake Leach, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Dexcom. \"We've long believed that people with diabetes should be able to view their CGM data where and how they choose. Direct to Apple Watch is a testament to that, allowing people with diabetes flexibility and choice in how they manage their health.\"</blockquote>Prior to the update, the Dexcom G7's Apple Watch app enabled users to consult a watch face complication, but there was a three-hour delay with synced data. Users will continue to need an ‌iPhone‌ to set up the G7 GCM with their Apple Watch, and the iOS Health app is still required to view blood glucose data alongside other biometrics tracked by Apple Watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Direct to Apple Watch feature is now available to G7 GCM users in the U.S., U.K., and Ireland, with the feature coming to additional markets later this month. Users will need the Dexcom G7 app version 2.1, an Apple Watch Series 6 or later running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a> or later, and an ‌iPhone‌ running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> or later.
