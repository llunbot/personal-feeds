And according to the latest leak, some of Apple‚Äôs most popular apps will be getting a complete makeover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://linktr.ee/analyst941&amp;xcust=1-1-1804205-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Analyst941 on Twitter</a>, who has been on a tear lately when it comes to WWDC leaks, has revealed the changes coming to the Wallet and Health apps, which will look a lot different in iOS 17. The ‚Äúconcept renders,‚Äù which show off many of the new features, were ‚Äúbased exactly on what I was shown earlier today,‚Äù according to the leaker.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>This is the new home of the Wallet app in iOS 17.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Swipe down to Search anywhere.<br />‚Ä¢ Sorted tabs for everything.<br />‚Ä¢ Apple Cash/Savings gets its own tab.<br />‚Ä¢ New ‚ÄúAll transactions‚Äù button.<br />‚Ä¢ much more, not pictured üò¨<br /><br />Sharing more info soon <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/mUjTjUUrps&amp;xcust=1-1-1804205-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/mUjTjUUrps</a></p>‚Äî 941 (@analyst941) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/analyst941/status/1652082138622066690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1804205-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 28, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with the Heath app, the renders show off the new Favorites screen that will now show a series of tiles with ‚Äúcolored graphs, tables, etc. filled with data inside each section‚Äù instead of a simple list. There are also rumors that the Health app is coming to watchOS 10 and iPadOS 17, and the streamlined interface makes sense for both larger and smaller screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wallet app is reportedly getting an even bigger redesign, with several new features, including swipe to search, sorted tabs for credit cards and passes, a dedicated tab for Apple Cash, and ‚Äúmuch more,‚Äù according to Analyst941. In the render provided, the app‚Äôs Home screen has a much cleaner organization, with smarter and simpler navigation aided by menus and buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Analyst941 also shares an image of the new Wallpaper tab in Settings with a grid layout that ‚Äúdisplays 9+ wallpapers at once‚Äù and lets you easily rearrange your favorites similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/786981/how-to-customize-lock-screen-ios-16.html\">customizable Lock Screen interface</a>. You‚Äôll also be able to easily share wallpapers and presumably, Lock Screens similar to Apple Watch faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will unveil iOS 17 at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on June 5 along with iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, and macOS 14. Several new products are also expected to debut, including a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> and the long-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">AR headset</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b2a686db2f62c16034b1a0a9013fca1623ee4c3a9b23932d8e0dfc675a1b3060","category":"Apple"}
