If you have experienced this frustrating issue, you are not alone. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-General-Keyboard-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255245306\">Apple Community forums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/17i3ty7/app_switching_while_typing/\">Reddit</a> contain similar reports of people being kicked out of Messages, Notes, and other apps mid-sentence only to find themselves in another app because they were still tapping the screen when the app switcher suddenly appeared. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can <a href=\"https://share.icloud.com/photos/03dLrdmaTOPNY0bSiGlYxKpcQ\">see it in action here</a>. The bug can be hard to replicate, but it seems to happen to affected users when they have been typing on the virtual keyboard at pace for a while. The bug has been reported in all versions of ‌iOS 17‌ up to and including the most recent iOS 17.1.2 update, and some users have returned their ‌iPhone‌ only for it to occur on the replacement device, suggesting that Apple is not sufficiently aware of the problem. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUntil Apple deals with the issue, there is a temporary fix – or more accurately a workaround, since it involves turning off Reachability, a feature that some users will undoubtedly miss. Reachability is an optional feature that lowers the top half of the screen so it's within easy reach of your fingers. Here's how to disable it.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your ‌iPhone‌.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Under \"Physical and Motor,\" select <strong>Touch</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Turn off the switch next to <strong>Reachability</strong>.</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/turn-off-reachability.jpg\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisabling Reachability appears to stop the typing bug in its tracks for everyone affected, which suggests Apple has an unidentified sensitivity issue linked to the accessibility feature. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Anna!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reachability/\">Reachability</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-17-bug-switches-apps-while-typing-fix/\">iOS 17 Bug Switches Apps While Typing - How to Fix</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-bug-switches-apps-while-typing-how-to-fix.2412852/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"76172a4b5317a364f66520d666dabf6cdf218ca1cb55e14b634713cfdc315b52","category":"Apple"}
