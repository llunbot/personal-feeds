Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet?srnd=phx-technology\">reports</a> that the update drought will end later this year, when the mini will <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/report-mac-mini-could-skip-the-apple-m3-jump-right-to-the-m4-in-2024-or-2025/\">skip right from the M2 to the M4</a>, something he originally reported back in April.</p>\n<p>But the mini will reportedly come with more than just new chips: it will also get a new, smaller design, which Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet?srnd=phx-technology\">says</a> will be closer in size to an Apple TV box (specifically, he says it may be a bit taller, but will have a substantially smaller footprint). The new mini could have \"at least three USB-C ports,\" as well as a power connector and an HDMI port.</p>\n<p>This would be Apple's first overhaul of the Mac mini's design since the original aluminum unibody version was released <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-2-duo-2.4-mid-2010-specs.html\">back in June of 2010</a>. That model did include a slot for a built-in SuperDrive DVD burner, something Apple dropped from later models as optical drives became less necessary, but the M2 Mac mini has the same basic design and the same footprint as that Core 2 Duo Mac mini introduced over a decade ago.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041901#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041901&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5c02673e7161973d7716910d71f4fa737b04605ca53b3d8438c2abecef67304f","category":"Tech"}
