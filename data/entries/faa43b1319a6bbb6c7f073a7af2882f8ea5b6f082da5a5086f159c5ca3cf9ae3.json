Maybe the Clem is slightly more comfortable over rough stuff, but the tires still make way more of a difference in comfort than the flex of the tubing, so don’t read into this too much. If I were choosing between a flex-less Clem with soft tires and a flexy Clem with hard tires, I’d choose the flex-less, soft-tired Clem every time.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rivendell</a>‘s Friday newsletter included this nifty video. What do you think about this experiment? </p>\n<p>Our take: frame flex is mostly discernible in cornering through rough stuff or powering up a climb. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/video-rivendell-the-string-test-for-bike-flex/\">VIDEO: Rivendell – The String Test for Bike Flex</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"faa43b1319a6bbb6c7f073a7af2882f8ea5b6f082da5a5086f159c5ca3cf9ae3","category":"Cycling"}
