Travel during this week will likely rival pre-pandemic levels, according to estimates by AAA and the Transportation Security Administration. And many families are anxious to resume holiday traditions and packed family gatherings, in which unvaccinated children are at risk of getting and transmitting the virus.</p>\n<p>In the week of November 11 to 18, nearly 142,000 children reported getting COVID-19. That's an increase of 32 percent from two weeks ago. Overall, cases of COVID-19 in the US have increased 27 percent in the past two weeks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815258#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815258&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6d330367c6339f513146a4d16213eac42e694bf551507917149998a8ac1be699","category":"Tech"}
