Many look like flat-sole mountain bike shoes, but others are more similar to typical clipless XC shoes.</p>\n<p>All the shoes here take cleats for clipless pedals.

Some flat-pedal shoes have soles that are stiffer than others, but none are as stiff as a dedicated cross-country shoe.</p>\n<p>Clipless-pedal shoes come in a wider variety of forms, catering to virtually every sort of rider. They range from XC shoes, which are much like road shoes but with a little bit of tread on the soles, all the way to DH shoes that resemble their flat-pedal counterparts, save for cleat mounts.</p>\n<p>Unsure of what’s right for you?

Laces are the traditional option, but there are alternatives.</p>\n<p>Laces give you great control over a shoe’s feel and fit but can’t be adjusted on the fly and can get claggy with mud – unless they’re protected by a lace flap.</p>\n<p>Boa systems use a ratchet dial and a wire that’s looped through the shoe’s opening for quick, easy and accurate closure and adjustment. They’re found on pricier shoes and tend to be specced to help save weight.</p>\n<p>Velcro straps and ratchet buckles are more common and pretty rugged but weigh a bit more. They tend to come on cheaper and mid-price shoes.</p>\n<h3>Sole</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Udog Distanza gravel shoes\" title=\"Udog goes gravel with the Distanza - 07\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> XC and trail shoes will feature a stiffer sole for better power transfer, though this theory is disputed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The sole is key in defining how the shoe performs. XC riders will want a stiff sole that transfers every watt of power to the pedals (though <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/does-cycling-shoe-stiffness-actually-matter/\">how much of a difference a stiff sole makes is debatable</a>). A stiff sole also helps improve comfort when the shoe is perched on a small clipless pedal.</p>\n<p>Pricier shoes will benefit from a light and stiff carbon sole, while cheaper ones use plastic, which is heavier and more flexible.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fox Union Boa shoe sole\" title=\"Fox Shoes .Fox Union Boa shoe sole Standish Wood , Randwick , Stoud .

Some shoes offer a lightweight minimal tread, which is great for racing but will come up short if you need to run or walk anywhere while out on the trail. Others offer more grip and protection but weigh a little more as a result.</p>","author":"James McKnight","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"82b5eb9340227cf5f47a2fdf62c7d8c8e46bab6460cd3e94c1cd24529b2b515b","category":"Cycling"}
