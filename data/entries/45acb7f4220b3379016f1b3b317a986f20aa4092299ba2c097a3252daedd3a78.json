There's a problem with the electric vehicle's flush-set door handles, which VW says don't meet its waterproofing specs. Consequently, moisture can get into the door controller's circuit board, possibly allowing the door to open while the EV is in motion.</p>\n<p>As a result, VW has issued a recall for almost 100,000 ID.4s, as well as suspending production of the popular crossover at its factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and issuing a stop-sale to VW dealers. The stop-sale applies to preowned ID.4s as well as vehicles on lots yet to find their first owner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V651-7277.PDF\">The recall</a> applies to all US ID.4sâ€”99,064 in total, from the initial <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/two-days-with-a-volkswagen-id-4-heres-what-we-learned/\">model-year 2021 cars</a> built in Germany to the latest <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-2024-volkswagen-id-4-pro-gets-a-new-rear-motor-way-more-efficiency/\">2024 models</a> made <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/volkswagens-electric-id-4-was-already-good-does-awd-change-that/\">in the USA</a>. VW first started hearing complaints in February 2024. By June, together with its suppliers, it had determined the problem was due to inadequate protection against water entering and then corroding the door handle electronics.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050922#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050922&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
