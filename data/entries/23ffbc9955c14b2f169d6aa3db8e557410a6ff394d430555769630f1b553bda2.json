Some earlier reports said the two companies had finalized an agreement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/\">following discussions</a>. It is possible that the negotiations are still ongoing, but this is not confirmed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nIf the partnership does happen, Baidu would likely power some of iOS 18's rumored generative AI features in China only.
