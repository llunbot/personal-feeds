At WWDC that year, Apple unveiled the ‌iMac‌ Pro, after years of rumors about a \"Pro\" ‌iMac‌. The ‌iMac‌ Pro sought to placate many of Apple's discontented professional Mac users, coming around four years after the launch of the controversial \"trashcan\" ‌Mac Pro‌, but two years before the current ‌Mac Pro‌ design, which returned to a modular tower design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple presented the ‌iMac‌ Pro as \"the most powerful Mac ever made.\" It featured 8-, 10-, 14-, or 18-core Intel Xeon processor options, a 5K display, AMD Vega graphics, ECC memory, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, with a starting price of $4,999. It was also the first Mac to contain a custom T2 chip, as well as the first desktop Mac to be available in Space Gray. While it did not have a slot to easily access the memory like the 27-inch ‌iMac‌, the processor, memory, and storage were not soldered in place and could easily be removed if the display was disassembled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March 2021, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/06/apple-confirms-imac-pro-will-be-discontinued/\">announced</a> that it was discontinuing the ‌iMac‌ Pro. By that time, the machine had been surpassed by the 2019 ‌Mac Pro‌, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/04/new-27-inch-imac-10th-gen-intel/\">significant final update</a> for the 27-inch ‌iMac‌, and the first Apple silicon Macs. The ‌iMac‌ Pro's position in Apple's product lineup is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/17/apple-executives-discuss-mac-studio/\">now effectively held</a> by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a> and the Studio Display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYet after the launch of the 24-inch Apple silicon ‌iMac‌ in April 2021 and the discontinuation of the 27-inch ‌iMac‌ in March 2022, interest in an ‌iMac‌ Pro with a larger display has increased. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/04/gurman-apple-still-working-on-pro-imac/\">Mark Gurman believed</a> that Apple was still \"working on a larger-screened ‌iMac‌ aimed at the professional market,\" a rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/06/kuo-imac-pro-in-2023-27-inch-display-this-year/\">supported by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, as of 2022. Yet <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/11/apple-no-larger-screened-imac-pro/\">other reports</a> claimed Apple has no plans to release a new high-end ‌iMac‌ at all. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors suggest that a larger-screened ‌iMac‌ that could be positioned as an ‌iMac‌ Pro will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/\">launch in 2025</a>. In July 2024, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-still-working-on-larger-imac/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple is still exploring a larger ‌iMac‌, but it is unclear when it could be released.
