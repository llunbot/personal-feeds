Apple is accused of advertising functionality that did not exist, and continuing to promote the ‌Siri‌ capabilities well after the company was aware that they would not be available on time.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Contrary to Defendant's claims of advanced AI capabilities, the Products offered a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence, misleading consumers about its actual utility and performance. Worse yet, Defendant promoted its Products based on these overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThe lawsuit was filed in a San Jose, California court and the plaintiffs are seeking class action status along with damages for customers who purchased an Apple device that supports ‌Apple Intelligence‌.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/\">Apple Facing False Advertising Lawsuit Over Apple Intelligence Delay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-facing-false-advertising-lawsuit-over-apple-intelligence-delay.2453616/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cfc9e802a07a7fbb80c8990aec074d60499aa218e699ebae9df93312a2be0e09","category":"Apple"}
