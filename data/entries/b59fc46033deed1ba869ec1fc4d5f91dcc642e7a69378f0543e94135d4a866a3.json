The team did so with a scratch-built EV, designing everything from its chassis to its circuit boards, and bested the existing record—<a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/corporate/2022/12/electric-car-goes-from-0-to-100-km-h-in-1-461-seconds-730325#:~:text=A%20team%20of%20students%20from,seconds%20on%2023%20September%202022.\">set last year by students in Stuttgart, Germany</a>—by more than a third.</p>\n<p>The near-instant torque of an electric motor means that even a relatively low-powered hatchback like the Mini Cooper SE or Chevrolet Bolt feels quick off the line. In the days before electric propulsion's recent renaissance, a 0–60 mph time in the three-second range was the stuff of unobtainium. Now, you can buy a Tesla Model 3 that will hit 60 in 3.5 seconds for less than $50,000.</p>\n<p>As the price point goes up, the 0–60 time comes down. Anything starting with a 2.x is quick enough that it overcomes even the most jaded road tester in a way that taking 1 second longer to get there doesn't. Tesla will sell you a Model S that will get you there that quick, and Porsche's Taycan Turbo S is designed to do hard launches all day long until the battery is drained.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967894#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967894&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
