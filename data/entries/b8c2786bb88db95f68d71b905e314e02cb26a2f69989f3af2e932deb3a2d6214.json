If you're of a slightly younger age, you probably remember him as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/on-kickstarter-everyone-is-peter-molyneux/\">the serial overpromiser</a> behind <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/peter-molyneuxs-introspective-attempt-to-revive-the-god-game/\"><em>Project Godus</em></a> and a recent NFT game that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/peter-molyneux-raises-54m-on-promise-of-play-to-earn-nft-game-legacy/\">somehow attracted $54 million in player pre-investment</a> (it <a href=\"https://x.com/pmolyneux/status/1717558557413933076\">did actually launch in some form last year</a>).</p>\n<p>I bring up this history because, after years of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/serial-over-promiser-peter-molyneux-promises-to-stop-over-promising/\">keeping his head down</a>, Molyneux made a surprise appearance at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT5ilwECdrA\">Gamescom's Opening Night Live event</a>. He was there to introduce <em>Masters of Albion</em>, a title that host Geoff Keighley said Molyneux has \"secretly been working on for the past three years\" and which Molyneux himself describes as \"an open-world god game full of combat, choices, mysteries, and story.\"</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lqo48WyiHQ\">short, early trailer</a> for the game takes us back to <em>Fable</em>'s \"familiar vast world of Albion, packed with stories, quests, treasures, and monsters.\" There, the residents of the town of Oakridge have to work to gather and process resources by day and then defend themselves from hordes of creatures by night.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044312#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044312&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b8c2786bb88db95f68d71b905e314e02cb26a2f69989f3af2e932deb3a2d6214","category":"Tech"}
