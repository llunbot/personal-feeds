Whether it’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/danny-macaskills-latest-video-is-mindblowing/\">riding down immense cliffs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj0CmnxuTaQ\">taking the kid for a ride</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv3xVOs7_No\">distorting scale to dizzying effect</a>, you’re guaranteed a good time when MacAskill releases a new video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his latest venture, there are all the usual displays of MacAskill’s craft, but with a vital message underpinning it all. In the lead up to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as COP26), MacAskill is on a mission to promote sustainability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video is largely filmed in a renewable energy factory, where MacAskill jumps and pirouettes between beams and pylons. And then there’s the vertigo-inducing conclusion, where he rides along the length of a wind-buffeted turbine blade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need a way to pass a few minutes – or an added incentive to think about climate change – it’s as good a place to start as any.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/danny-macaskills-latest-is-a-stunt-with-a-cause/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"fb94e03fd4bf6848885e6b4b742a544a53e77d2ea765f89728e450dc2d8edc21","category":"Cycling"}
