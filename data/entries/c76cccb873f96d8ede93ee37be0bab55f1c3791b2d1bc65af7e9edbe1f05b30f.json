The case, <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/march/cdph-press-release-03-07-20241.html\">announced on March 7</a>, was the first measles case identified in the city since 2019, officials noted. It remains unclear how that resident contracted the highly infectious virus, though the health department noted that the person had been in contact with domestic and international travelers. The person was said to be recovering well at home, and their infectious period ended on March 6.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009758#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009758&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c76cccb873f96d8ede93ee37be0bab55f1c3791b2d1bc65af7e9edbe1f05b30f","category":"Tech"}
