For example, Microsoft and Meta alone have committed over $65 billion each this year largely to AI infrastructure. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app uses DeepSeek-V3 model with over 600B parameters, and supports file uploads and web search. Investor Marc Andreessen is already calling the app \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs\" for its ability to show its work and reasoning as it addresses a user's written query or prompt. DeepSeek has also taken an open-source approach, allowing developers to freely inspect and build upon its technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat's particularly notable is that DeepSeek apparently achieved this breakthrough despite US export restrictions on advanced AI chips to China. The company's success suggests Chinese developers have found ways to create more efficient AI models with limited computing resources, potentially challenging the assumption that cutting-edge AI development requires massive computing infrastructure investments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe emergence of DeepSeek has already sparked debate in Silicon Valley. While some view it as a concerning development for US technological leadership, others, like Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, suggest it could benefit the entire AI industry by making model training more accessible and accelerating real-world AI applications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app's success has already impacted financial markets, with some AI-related stocks experiencing volatility as investors reconsider the necessity of extensive capital expenditure for AI development. Shares of Nvidia for example slid 10% in premarket trading on Monday on the news of DeepSeek's popularity. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-ai-app-top-app-store-ios/\">Budget AI Model DeepSeek Overtakes ChatGPT on App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/budget-ai-model-deepseek-overtakes-chatgpt-on-app-store.2448175/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e7d84930daa8aef76ada9eeb3059961630a2351239dbc9e5d91523b085611c8","category":"Apple"}
