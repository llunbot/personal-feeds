Summer in Grand Junction is hot, so road riding at 6:00 am is a must. I shot this with a 35mm film camera that fits in my jersey pocket. Worth waking up for this view!”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
