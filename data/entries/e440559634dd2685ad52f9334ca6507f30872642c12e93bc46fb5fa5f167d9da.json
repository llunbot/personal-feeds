And today it’s cheaper than ever: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Product-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDHWYMNS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 41mm for $329</a> in midnight and red and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Product-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDHHQ7P6/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">45mm Apple Watch Series 8 for $359</a> in red, a savings of $70 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Apple Watch SE is discounted to $219 (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHTQDRZ/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">40mm</a>) and $249 (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQT11V/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">44mm</a>), a savings of $30.
