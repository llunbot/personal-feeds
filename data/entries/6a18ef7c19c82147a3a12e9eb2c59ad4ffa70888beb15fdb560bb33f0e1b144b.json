Joining a network named \"%p%s%s%s%s%n\" could, in some cases, permanently disable WiFi on a device, and in many other cases, it required resetting an ‌iPhone‌ entirely.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the beta testing process, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/ios-14-7-wifi-bug-name-fix/\">was discovered</a> that the bug was no longer functional, and Apple's notes make it clear that the issue has been addressed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe iOS and iPadOS 14.7 updates also address a number of <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212601\">other security vulnerabilities</a> related to audio files, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>, PDFs, web images, and more, so all ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users should update to the new iOS 14.7 updates as soon as possible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are also security fixes in <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212602\">macOS Big Sur 11.5</a>, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212604\">tvOS 14.7</a>, and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\">watchOS 7.6</a>.
