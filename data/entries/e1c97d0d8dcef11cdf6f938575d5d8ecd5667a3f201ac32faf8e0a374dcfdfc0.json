There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning.

This airborne observatory first took flight in May 2010 and operated through September 2022. The 2.5-meter telescope flew at about 45,000 feet and observed all manner of phenomena from a vantage point above much of the Earth's atmosphere—celestial magnetic fields, star-forming regions, comets, and more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013723#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013723&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e1c97d0d8dcef11cdf6f938575d5d8ecd5667a3f201ac32faf8e0a374dcfdfc0","category":"Tech"}
