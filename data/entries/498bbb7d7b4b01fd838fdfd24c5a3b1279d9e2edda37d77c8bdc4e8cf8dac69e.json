Less than three weeks later, LG announced that it was adding advertisements to its TVs’ screensavers. The move embodies how ads are a growing and virtually inescapable part of the TV-viewing experience—even when you're not watching anything.</p>\n<p>As you might have expected, LG didn’t make a big, splashy announcement to consumers or LG TV owners about this new ad format. Instead, and ostensibly strategically, the September 5 announcement was made to advertisers. LG appears to know that screensaver ads aren't a feature that excites users. Still, it and many other TV makers are happy to shove ads into the software of already-purchased devices.</p>\n<p>LG TV owners may have already spotted the ads or learned about them via <a href=\"https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1727255253\">FlatpanelsHD</a>, which today reported seeing a full-screen ad on the screensaver for LG's latest flagship TV, the G4. “The ad appeared before the conventional screensaver kicks in,\" per the website, “and was localized to the region the TV was set to.” (You can see images that FlatpanelsHD provided of the ads <a href=\"https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/lgscreensaverad_5.jpg\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/lgscreensaverad_2_large.jpg\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/lgscreensaverad_1_large.jpg\">here</a>.) The reviewer reported seeing an ad for LG’s free ad-supported streaming channel, LG Channels, as well as third-party ads.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052278#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052278&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"498bbb7d7b4b01fd838fdfd24c5a3b1279d9e2edda37d77c8bdc4e8cf8dac69e","category":"Tech"}
