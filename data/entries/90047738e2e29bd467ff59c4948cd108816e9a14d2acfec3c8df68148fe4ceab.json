They’ve been together for decades and we take this opportunity to talk about MUGs, how they got started, what MUGs meant to the early days of the Mac, and what has happened to MUGs. MacinTech meets monthly and I joined them during their September meeting, which occurred the day after the Apple Glowtime event.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad Tombaugh, a founder of MacinTech, speaks about the history of MUGs. Several other members, including David Bourne, Chris Domino, and Robert Zimmerman, share their MUG stories. I failed to identify who was who during our chat, so I apologize for that. I’d like to thank Andy Suhaka of MacinTech for setting this all up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I encourage you to listen if you have never heard of a Mac User Group. They’ve got great stories and plenty of interesting history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is episode 908 with the <a href=\"https://macintech.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MacinTech Mac Users Group</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/Roman-Loyola/\" target=\"_blank\">Roman Loyola</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>Watch episode 908 on YouTube</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>Listen to episode 908 on Apple Podcasts</h2>\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>Listen to episode 908 on Spotify</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get info </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about the topics discussed on the show, click on the links below. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://macintech.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MacinTech: Macintosh Users Group for the South Denver Area</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.appleusergroupresources.com/?s=apple+user+group+near+me\" target=\"_blank\">Apple User Group Resources (Apple)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Subscribe to the Macworld Podcast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can subscribe to the Macworld Podcast—or leave us a review!—<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id563933198\">right here in the Podcasts app</a>.
