{"title":"One More Spitball Idea for Apple’s March 4 Media Event ‘Experience’: Immersive F1 on Vision Pro?","link":"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/official-grand-prix-start-times-for-2026-f1-season-confirmed.2UgPfArqH76tzlOYh21jSG","date":1771476098000,"content":"\n<p>A reader pointed out that <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/official-grand-prix-start-times-for-2026-f1-season-confirmed.2UgPfArqH76tzlOYh21jSG\">the 2026 Formula 1 season</a> starts in Australia on March 8. You will recall from October <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/17/apple-formula-1\">that Apple TV is now the exclusive broadcast partner for F1 in the U.S.</a> Apple is already dabbling with live immersive sports broadcasting for VisionOS <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/17/apple-formula-1\">with a limited slate of Lakers games this season</a>. If they have something planned for streaming F1 races live on Vision Pro, with some level of immersion, March 4 would be a pretty good date to demo that experience to the media.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t even have to be <em>live</em> race coverage. Technically that’s probably impossible for this season. It would just be a sign of confidence and interest in the platform long-term merely to see <em>some</em> sort of immersive component to F1 on Apple TV, even if it’s not live. Like “ride the track” to experience the turns and elevation changes.</p>\n\n<p>Could just be a total coincidence that the Formula 1 season is starting the weekend after this event. But it seems worth noting.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/18/immersive-f1-vision-pro-spitball\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b2874fe2cb49be152f2143ebb9ded3ca8f3e9a236f59e8fd0777b245f58002fb","category":"Tech"}
