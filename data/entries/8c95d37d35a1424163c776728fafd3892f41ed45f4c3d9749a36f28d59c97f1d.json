This is partly because its CEO and founder, Eugen Rochko, has <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/04/twitter-buyout-puts-mastodon-into-spotlight/\">emphasized</a> that the decentralized social network—which operates as a non-profit—will never be bought by a chaotic billionaire.</p>\n<p>However, some would-be Mastodon users fleeing Twitter apparently never made it through Mastodon's slightly more complicated sign-up process. Some of them quickly abandoned Mastodon after creating an account, becoming instantly confused when they were asked to find a server to join.

Acknowledging that Mastodon's sign-up process \"can be confusing,\" <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/\">Rochko announced</a> that this tweak to Mastodon removes \"friction from decentralized features\" and makes it \"as easy as possible\" for new users to \"get past the sign-up process and more quickly engage with others.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936085#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936085&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c95d37d35a1424163c776728fafd3892f41ed45f4c3d9749a36f28d59c97f1d","category":"Tech"}
