The new customization capability provides an easy-to-use interface for the latest fine-tuning techniques like reinforcement learning, so you can accelerate the AI model customization process from months to days.</p> \n<p>With a few clicks, you can seamlessly select a model and customization technique, and handle model evaluation and deployment—all entirely serverless so you can focus on model tuning rather than managing infrastructure. When you choose serverless customization, SageMaker AI automatically selects and provisions the appropriate compute resources based on the model and data size.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Getting started with serverless model customization</u></strong><br /> You can get started customizing models in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/studio/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>. Choose <strong>Models</strong> in the left navigation pane and check out your favorite AI models to be customized.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/17/2025-sagemaker-ai-custom-model-1-models.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1393\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Customize with UI</strong><br /> You can customize AI models in a only few clicks. In the <strong>Customize model</strong> dropdown list for a specific model such as <strong>Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct</strong>, choose <strong>Customize with UI</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/24/2025-sagemaker-ai-custom-model-2-with-ui.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1989\" height=\"2560\" /></p> \n<p>You can select a customization technique used to adapt the base model to your use case. SageMaker AI supports <strong>Supervised Fine-Tuning</strong> and the latest model customization techniques including <strong>Direct Preference Optimization</strong>, <strong>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)</strong>, and <strong>Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)</strong>. Each technique optimizes models in different ways, with selection influenced by factors such as dataset size and quality, available computational resources, task at hand, desired accuracy levels, and deployment constraints.</p> \n<p>Upload or select a training dataset to match the format required by the customization technique selected. Use the values of batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs recommended by the technique selected. You can conﬁgure advanced settings such as hyperparameters, a newly introduced serverless MLﬂow application for experiment tracking, and network and storage volume encryption. Choose <strong>Submit</strong> to get started on your model training job.</p> \n<p>After your training job is complete, you can see the models you created in the <strong>My Models</strong> tab. Choose <strong>View details</strong> in one of your models.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/17/2025-sagemaker-ai-custom-model-3-with-ui-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2076\" height=\"1396\" /></p> \n<p>By choosing <strong>Continue customization</strong>, you can continue to customize your model by adjusting hyperparameters or training with different techniques. By choosing <strong>Evaluate</strong>, you can evaluate your customized model to see how it performs compared to the base model.</p> \n<p>When you complete both jobs, you can choose either the <strong>SageMaker</strong> or <strong>Bedrock</strong> in the <strong>Deploy</strong> dropdown list to deploy your model.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/24/2025-sagemaker-ai-custom-model-4-with-ui-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2040\" height=\"1460\" /></p> \n<p>You can choose <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Bedrock</a> for serverless inference. Choose <strong>Bedrock</strong> and the model name to deploy the model into Amazon Bedrock. To find your deployed models, choose <strong>Imported models</strong> in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">Bedrock console</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/24/2025-sagemaker-ai-custom-model-5-with-ui-deploy-bedrock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2392\" height=\"1050\" /></p> \n<p>You can also deploy your model to a SageMaker AI inference endpoint if you want to control your deployment resources such as an instance type and instance count. After the SageMaker AI deployment is <strong>In service</strong>, you can use this endpoint to perform inference. In the <strong>Playground</strong> tab, you can test your customized model with a single prompt or chat mode.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/11/19/2025-sagemaker-ai-custom-model-6-with-ui-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2230\" height=\"2014\" /></p> \n<p>With the serverless MLﬂow capability, you can automatically log all critical experiment metrics without modifying code and access rich visualizations for further analysis.</p> \n<p><strong>Customize with code</strong><br /> When you choose customizing with code, you can see a sample notebook to fine-tune or deploy AI models. If you want to edit the sample notebook, open it in JupyterLab.
