As it will use the ‌M1‌ Pro and Max chips, Apple considers it a \"Pro\" device and is calling it the ‌iMac‌ Pro internally, according to Dylandkt\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>iMac (Pro)<br />Promotion and Mini Led<br />Base model 16gb Ram 512gb Storage<br />M1 Pro and Max<br />Dark bezels<br />HDMI, SD Card, Usb C<br />Similar design to iMac 24 and Pro Display XDR<br />Starting price at or over 2000 dollars<br />Ethernet on brick standard<br />Face ID was tested (Not confirmed)<br />1H 2022</p>— Dylan (@dylandkt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1454461506280636419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe leaker claims that the ‌iMac‌ will feature a 27-inch mini-LED display with ProMotion technology, though some prior rumors have indicated that the next-generation ‌iMac‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/larger-imac-apple-silicon-still-coming/\">will have a larger display</a>. Unlike the 24-inch ‌iMac‌, the \"‌iMac‌ Pro\" will feature dark bezels, and bezel size could be slimmed down.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDesign wise, it could look similar to the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ and the Pro Display XDR, and Apple has apparently tested Face ID for the machine, but this is not a confirmed feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe base model ‌iMac‌ will feature 16GB memory and 512GB of storage, and all models will be equipped with an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and several USB-C/Thunderbolt ports, similar to the MacBook Pro. Apple is also said to be including an Ethernet port on the power adapter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDylandkt says that the ‌iMac‌ will have a starting price at or over $2,000, and it will be launching in the first half of 2022. The upcoming \"‌iMac‌ Pro\" will replace the current Intel-based 27-inch ‌iMac‌ models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe haven't heard much about Apple's larger ‌iMac‌, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has confirmed that such a machine is in the works. Apple reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips\">paused work</a> on the bigger ‌iMac‌ to work on the 24-inch model, but now that the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ is out, development can resume.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDisplay analyst Ross Young has also said that Apple is working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-27-inch-xdr-display-early-2022-rumor/\">new 27-inch iMac</a> with a mini-LED display and ProMotion display technology.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/imac-pro-2022-rumors/\">'iMac Pro' Coming in 2022 With M1 Pro/Max Chips, 27-Inch Mini-LED Display, MacBook Pro Ports and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imac-pro-coming-in-2022-with-m1-pro-max-chips-27-inch-mini-led-display-macbook-pro-ports-and-more.2320768/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KLVt-BbI4lA:GC_56zJCk7I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KLVt-BbI4lA:GC_56zJCk7I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KLVt-BbI4lA\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8ee8866d1967d0bd4c7ae095f1867d7eeb26a05f88e149f16655f71e901a41df","category":"Apple"}
