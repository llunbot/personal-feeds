No lump sum. No trade-in stress. You pay monthly for your MacBook (starting at $33.28/mo) and have the option to upgrade every 2 years — all without leaving your desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with WWDC happening this month, it’s a perfect time to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A smarter way to get a MacBook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://getupgraded.com/?utm_source=macworld&amp;utm_content=june2025\">Upgraded</a> is a smarter, subscription-style way to own and upgrade your MacBook, designed for people who want top-tier performance without the upfront cost or the hassle of reselling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose your MacBook:</strong> Pick from the latest models, including Airs and Pros — all brand new and shipped straight from Apple Premier Partner GatorTec.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pay monthly:</strong> Plans start at <strong>$33.28/month</strong>, with <strong>0% APR available</strong> for qualified customers through Affirm.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Upgrade every 2 years:</strong> After 24 payments, you’re eligible to trade up to a newer model. Or, finish paying off the device over 36 months and it’s yours to keep forever.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Send your old one back — easily:</strong> When it’s time to upgrade, just ship your Mac back to Upgraded with a prepaid box. No listings. No meetups. No awkward negotiations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, Upgraded handles everything — from secure delivery to professionally refurbishing your old device. That means less e-waste, more convenience, and a smoother path to always having the MacBook you want, for a price you can afford.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Upgraded MacBook 2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-2.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>With Upgraded, customers can get a new MacBook every two years with simple monthly payments.</figcaption></figure><p>Upgraded</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Now with Affirm: Smarter financing, made simple</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Upgraded now partners with <strong>Affirm</strong>, the trusted financing provider behind brands like Apple, Amazon, and Target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means getting your next MacBook just got easier — and more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why this matters:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>As low as 0% APR:</strong> Qualified customers can pay monthly with no interest</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More approvals:</strong> A wider range of credit profiles are now eligible</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No hidden fees.

Either way, you stay in control — and your cash keeps working for you.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Upgraded MacBook 4\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upgraded-MacBook-4.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Upgraded keeps you informed – no surprises, no guesswork.</figcaption></figure><p>Upgraded</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join thousands who have already upgraded</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From students and freelancers to designers, developers, and die-hard Apple fans; more and more people are choosing Upgraded as their go-to way to get a MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One customer put it best: <em>“Honestly, I couldn’t ask for a more Apple-like experience from a company that isn’t Apple.” – Jonathan</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the latest Mac without the upfront cost, the resale headache, or the financing confusion, Upgraded makes it easy.
