Or to scan one to your computer? The obvious answer is \"none.\" But if you own certain printers from companies like HP and Canon, you won't be able to use core features unless the device has ink—even if those features <em>have nothing to do with ink. </em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, all-in-one printers arbitrarily demanding ink to perform non-printing functions <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/if-you-want-to-scan-without-an-ink-cartridge-maybe-dont-buy-an-all-in-one-at-all/\">isn't a new frustration</a>. And that's despite some companies having printers that can <a href=\"https://support.brother.com/g/b/faqend.aspx?c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfcj4335dw_us_eu&amp;faqid=faq00002608_007\">scan without ink</a>. Clearly, scanning or faxing without requiring an ink cartridge would improve users' experience—and they've illustrated that through class-action lawsuits. But this hasn't stopped printer makers from fighting to keep the nettlesome practice.</p>\n<h2>No ink, no scan</h2>\n<p>Since mid-2022, HP has been fighting a class-action lawsuit alleging that certain all-in-one printer models won't scan or fax without ink and that HP doesn't properly disclose this to shoppers. On January 13, 2023, the complaint was dismissed but allowed to be amended (you can view the amended complaint here: [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hp-complaint.pdf\">PDF</a>]), and on August 10, a Northern District of California judge dismissed HP's motion to dismiss the amended complaint [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/HP-dismissed.pdf\">PDF</a>].</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960855#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960855&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"89318f808f570930aa2e0894e03221f37a39355aeba6d8c7957806773f33e6c0","category":"Tech"}
