That was the case for one of my favorite spots at the <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/Sea-Otter-Classic\" target=\"_blank\">Sea Otter Classic</a> 2023, 5Dev. The San Diego company makes their components out of milled aluminum and titanium. And while their cranks, chainrings, pedals, and more might not be the first name in value-oriented components, their components sure are distinctive.</span></p>\n<p><span>5Dev is the younger, more expressive division of an aerospace machining company called 5th Axis. Their position mean they clogged up a critical artery of the Sea Otter Classic, but everyone who stopped by was sure to see something cool.</span></p>\n<p><span>To be clear, a majority of this gear is mountain bike-centric, but it all shows off their manufacturing prowess. Folks interested in road and gravel will be happy to know 5DEV has gravel cranks unofficially ready for order, with an official release later this year. </span></p>\n<p><span>With that said, here’s what to expect from the young company.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/04/wtb-devo-saddle-handle-sea-otter-classic-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Why does the WTB Devo saddle have a handle in it? — Sea Otter Classic 2023</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5Dev-bikes-machined-crankset-start-finish.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"5Dev-bikes-machined-crankset---start-finish\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5Dev-bikes-machined-crankset-start-finish.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5Dev-bikes-machined-crankset-start-finish.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>5Dev’s cranks start with a block billet aluminum.
