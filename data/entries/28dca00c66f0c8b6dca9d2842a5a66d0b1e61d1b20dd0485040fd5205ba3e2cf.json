Apple will likely soon update the footnote again to reflect the new data, which indicates spatial audio is limited to newer iPhones and iPads.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThose who have older iPhones and iPads can still access spatial audio with several headphone options including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, Beats X, Beats Solo3 Wireless, Beats Studio3, Powerbeats3 Wireless, Beats Flex, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/\">Powerbeats Pro</a>, Beats Solo Pro, or Beats Studio Buds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn Macs, all of the above listed headphone options work as well as the built-in speakers on MacBook Pro (2018 model or later), <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> (2018 model or later), or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> (2021 model).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holgr/status/1418279039513489410\">Holger</a>!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/apple-music-spatial-audio-built-in-speaker-compatibility/\">Apple Music's Spatial Audio Feature Doesn't Work With Built-In Speakers of iPhone XR, iPad, or iPad mini</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-musics-spatial-audio-feature-doesnt-work-with-built-in-speakers-of-iphone-xr-ipad-or-ipad-mini.2305121/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w6_hRdLU8nk:Bd2Ivj_Fu7I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w6_hRdLU8nk:Bd2Ivj_Fu7I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/w6_hRdLU8nk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"28dca00c66f0c8b6dca9d2842a5a66d0b1e61d1b20dd0485040fd5205ba3e2cf","category":"Apple"}
