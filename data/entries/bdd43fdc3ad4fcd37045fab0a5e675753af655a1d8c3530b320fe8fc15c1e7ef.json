These automatically detect the orientation of the pedal to show a white light when facing forward and a red light when facing rearward.</p>\n<p>We liked the idea and the execution but hoped to see the tech taken further with integration into an SPD design for long-distance commuters and more.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> <span>The new Redshift Arclight Pro pedals are designed as a do-it-all clipless option for commuters, gravel riders and mountain bikers alike.</span></span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Well, it seems Redshift was listening and the new Arclight Pro Clipless applies the design to an SPD-compatible pedal.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the Arclight Pro Clipless is a modular design. This means it can be stripped down into an XC/gravel SPD pedal or MTB-style platform <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">SPD pedal</a> without lights, or as a platform SPD pedal with the built-in lights.</p>\n<p>The new pedals complement the Arclight City flat pedals and Arclight Pro flat pedals in the Redshift range.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The platform can be removed to reveal a pared-back SPD pedal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h2>Always-on visibility</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pedals have three main configurations: SPD-only with no lights, SPD platform with no lights and SPD platform with lights, as pictured here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Each set of pedals comes with four light modules that contain COB LED strips. As before, these slide into the hollows on the pedal platform and lock into place. Windows in the pedal platform enable front, rear and side visibility for the lights.</p>\n<p>As with the original Arclight pedals, the clever part here is in how the lights turn on automatically when they sense movement, as well as sensing the orientation of the pedals to switch between white and red lights.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lights can be used on the bike, too, with the magnetic mount and O-ring pictured here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The lights have claimed run times of:</p>\n<ul><li>36 hours in eco-flash mode</li>\n<li>11 hours in flashing mode</li>\n<li>3 hours in constant mode</li>\n</ul><p>They are charged via a four-port USB dock included with the pedals, so you can charge all of the lights simultaneously.</p>\n<p>You can buy handlebar or seatpost mounts for the light units separately, so you can use them as regular <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">bike lights</a> if needed.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Redshift provides a four-port charging station for the lights.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h2>On the scales</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> <span>The threaded pins are removable.</span></span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Our sample set of pedals weigh:</p>\n<ul><li>275g each in SPD ‘race’ form</li>\n<li>327g each as an SPD platform pedal without lights</li>\n<li>378g each as an SPD platform pedal with lights</li>\n</ul><p>The Redshift Arclight Pro pedals are available now and priced at £149.99 / $159.99 / €174.99 / AU$254.99</p>\n<p>Look out for a full review on BikeRadar.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Warren Rossiter","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"bdd43fdc3ad4fcd37045fab0a5e675753af655a1d8c3530b320fe8fc15c1e7ef","category":"Cycling"}
