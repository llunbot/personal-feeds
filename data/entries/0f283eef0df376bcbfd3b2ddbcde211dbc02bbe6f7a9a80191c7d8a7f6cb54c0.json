The report said that Pichai shared this remark in court today, during the U.S. Department of Justice's ongoing antitrust trial against Google.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Google-Gemini-Phone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"731\" />\r<br />\nPichai confirmed that he held a series of discussions with Apple CEO Tim Cook about Google Gemini integration on iPhones last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce iOS 19 during its annual developers conference WWDC, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/\">kicks off Monday, June 9</a>. That would align with  the mid-2025 timeframe provided by Pichai, so it seems likely that iOS 19 will offer Google Gemini integration, should a deal be reached. iOS 19 should be released to the general public in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone models with Apple Intelligence have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-iphone-chatgpt-integration/\">already offered ChatGPT integration since iOS 18.2</a>. With user permission, Siri can show ChatGPT answers directly in response to questions and other prompts. ChatGPT is also an option for Apple's system-wide Writing Tools feature, allowing users to generate text and images.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle Gemini would have similar integration across Siri and Writing Tools on iPhone models that are compatible with Apple Intelligence, which includes the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle Gemini is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729\">already available as an iPhone app</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gemini/\">Gemini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/ios-19-google-gemini-integration-likely/\">Google CEO Suggests iOS 19 Will Feature Built-In Gemini Integration</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-ceo-suggests-ios-19-will-feature-built-in-gemini-integration.2456245/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0f283eef0df376bcbfd3b2ddbcde211dbc02bbe6f7a9a80191c7d8a7f6cb54c0","category":"Apple"}
