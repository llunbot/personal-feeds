However, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last week reported that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-intelligence-siri-overhaul-could-get-delayed/\">considering delaying or limiting</a> at least some of its promised <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/siri-2025-updates/\">Apple Intelligence enhancements for Siri</a> until iOS 18.5, due to the presence of bugs and other software engineering issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Apple Intelligence features for Siri were originally expected to debut with iOS 18.4, according to Gurman. The enhancements include on-screen awareness, understanding of a user's personal context, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first iOS 18.4 beta is expected to be released this week. Gurman said it is still possible that at least some of the Apple Intelligence features for Siri will be included in iOS 18.4, but they could be turned off by default. Even still, it is possible that the features might not be added until later iOS 18.4 beta versions, buying Apple more time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the beta testing period, Apple's website suggests that iOS 18.4 will be released in April, but it is unclear if that timeframe will shift due to the reported bugs and potential delays with the Apple Intelligence for Siri rollout.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first iOS 18.5 beta should arrive in April, and that update would likely be released in May, based on the typical iOS release schedule.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence requires an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 model.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/apple-already-testing-ios-18-5/\">iOS 18.5 Already in Testing as Apple Intelligence Features for Siri Potentially Delayed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-5-already-in-testing-as-apple-intelligence-features-for-siri-potentially-delayed.2449535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c885f6f8ac87507e7f7d267633b19d54bbb3ace231b7fd7ec634ce6a9e42751e","category":"Apple"}
