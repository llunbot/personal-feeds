Users reports that iTunes Match is stuck in a constant loop of uploading songs or \"Matching your music with songs in the iTunes Store.\" The issue has become so widespread across Twitter that users have created an \"iTunesMatchBroken\" hashtag.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA large reason for users' frustration is the silence from Apple on the issue. The Apple Support account on Twitter has only responded to some user reports with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/applesupport/status/1422579224645410817\">vague responses and prompts to send the support team a message</a>. In private conversation, some users were told by Apple Support that there is no ongoing issue with the service and that it's instead an issue with their device, despite the widespread nature of issues. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA few of the reports point to the recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a> 11.5 update as the trigger for the issue; however, users across macOS versions are also sharing their unpleasant experiences. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the last week, Apple has refused to respond to comment on the situation, including whether the service is in the process of being shut down. If we do hear back from Apple, we'll be sure to let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itunes-match/\">iTunes Match</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/itunes-match-users-report-widespread-issues/\">iTunes Match Users Frustratingly Report Widespread Issues</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/itunes-match-users-frustratingly-report-widespread-issues.2306621/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=o4tVHKZo7u4:_QWAurNmpu0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=o4tVHKZo7u4:_QWAurNmpu0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/o4tVHKZo7u4\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8ad2f062df7026990a34bc3edc2065a52bdd66691e30e5520d42451ad3333ebf","category":"Apple"}
