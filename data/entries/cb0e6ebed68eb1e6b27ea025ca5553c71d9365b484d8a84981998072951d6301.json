During a presentation at Meta Connect 2023, the company said it is launching its own \"Meta AI\" chat assistant and a selection of AI characters across its messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.</p>\n\n<p>Meta's new AI assistant will likely feel familiar to anyone who has used chatbots like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">ChatGPT</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/new-chatgpt-rival-claude-2-launches-for-open-beta-testing/\">Claude</a>. It is designed as a general-purpose chatbot that Meta says can help with planning trips, answering questions, and generating images from text prompts. The assistant will also integrate real-time results from Microsoft's Bing search engine, giving it access to current informationâ€”similar to Bing Chat, ChatGPT's browsing plugin, and Google Bard.</p>\n<p>During demos, The Verge says that Meta's AI was able to quickly generate high-resolution images from short text descriptions using an \"/imagine\" prompt, and the feature will be free to use. While Meta did not disclose full details of the new AI assistant's training, the company said it's a custom model that is partially based on the company's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/\">LLaMA 2</a> language model, released in July.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971859#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971859&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb0e6ebed68eb1e6b27ea025ca5553c71d9365b484d8a84981998072951d6301","category":"Tech"}
