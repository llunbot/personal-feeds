{"title":"Flighty 3.0","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/flight-tracker-flighty-adds-a-private-social-network-for-tracking-loved-ones-travels/","date":1691011042000,"content":"\n<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch last week:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With today’s launch of Flighty 3.0, users will have a new way of\nsharing their flight information with trusted others, without\nhaving to rely on forwarding airline confirmation emails or\nsending texts.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Flighty is introducing the concept of “Flighty Friends,”\na way to track loved ones’ flight details automatically. The\nconcept builds on the friends’ flights feature already available\nin previous versions of Flighty, which allowed users to share\ntheir live flight information with others through the app.</p>\n\n<p>Now, users can connect directly with one another in Flighty — similar to how you would “friend” someone on a social network.\nAfterward, the connected users would receive updates about their\nfamily members’ or friends’ flights on an ongoing basis. The app’s\nnotifications would then read something like “mom has landed,”\ninstead of just noting a flight number has landed, and would\ninclude the user’s profile photo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Terrific update to one of my very favorite iOS apps. We don’t fly a ton, but my family flies often enough that <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1358823008\">Flighty</a>’s $89/year family plan feels like a bargain. It’s just $49/year for a single-user account. Everything about Flighty is just so nice, and so convenient. Its Live Activities widget is so well done that Apple featured Flighty in the WWDC keynote, and gave it an Apple Design Award this year.</p>\n\n<p>Last year I had a flight get cancelled about an hour before it was supposed to start boarding. I got an alert from Flighty, immediately dashed over to the nearest gate agent, and got rebooked on another flight <em>before</em> American Airlines notified me that the original flight had been cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>Back in January <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/meanwhile_over_in_androidtown\">I wrote about the vast discrepency between best-of-breed apps on iOS compared to Android</a>, using Mastodon clients as an example. Flighty is another such exemplar. It’s exclusive to iOS and MacOS, and there’s simply nothing close to it on Android. Flighty’s free mode is quite useful too, and you get access to Flighty Pro free of charge for your first flight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://thriftytraveler.com/news/travel/flighty-app-friends-flights/\">Gunnar Olson writing for Thrifty Traveler</a>, and <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-fly-without-these-five-travel-apps-b17b0755\">Dawn Gilbertson writing for the WSJ</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/flighty-3\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2fb234fc7b8adb0ffdd43b2433bb8285e03fec9ac4b5b3739dbf5987bf4f336d","category":"Tech"}
