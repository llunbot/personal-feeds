It’s good news for the planet,” Matthew Ives, one of the report’s authors and a senior researcher at the Oxford Martin Post-Carbon Transition Programme, told Ars.</p>\n<p>The paper used probabilistic cost forecasting methods—taking into account both past data and current and ongoing technological developments in renewables—for its findings. It also used large caches of data from sources such as the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Bloomberg. Beyond looking at the cost (represented as dollar per unit of energy production over time), the report also represents its findings in three scenarios: a fast transition to renewables, a slow transition, and no transition at all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799858#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799858&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Doug Johnson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b2a7655a60321389e6edcfac9a5aec2ee259d0aa0b2ee6c1e7a359652253f30","category":"Tech"}
