You can get early access to unique features of Anthropic’s Claude model in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock\">Amazon Bedrock</a> to reimagine user experiences, reinvent your businesses, and accelerate your generative AI journeys.</p> \n<p>In November 2023, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-now-provides-access-to-anthropics-latest-model-claude-2-1/\">Amazon Bedrock provided access to Anthropic’s Claude 2.1</a>, which delivers key capabilities to build generative AI for enterprises. Claude 2.1 includes a 200,000 token context window, reduced rates of hallucination, improved accuracy over long documents, system prompts, and a beta tool use feature for function calling and workflow orchestration.</p> \n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family\">Anthropic announced Claude 3</a>, a new family of state-of-the-art AI models that allows customers to choose the exact combination of intelligence, speed, and cost that suits their business needs. The three models in the family are<strong> Claude 3 Haiku</strong>, the fastest and most compact model for near-instant responsiveness, <strong>Claude 3 Sonnet</strong>, the ideal balanced model between skills and speed, and <strong>Claude 3 Opus</strong>, a most intelligent offering for the top-level performance on highly complex tasks.</p> \n<p>We’re also announcing the availability of <strong>Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet</strong> today in Amazon Bedrock, with Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3 Haiku coming soon. For the vast majority of workloads, Claude 3 Sonnet model is two times faster than Claude 2 and Claude 2.1, with increased steerability, and new image-to-text vision capabilities.</p> \n<p>With Claude 3 Sonnet’s availability in Amazon Bedrock, you can build cost-effective generative AI applications for enterprises that need intelligence, reliability, and speed. You can now use Anthropic’s latest model, Claude 3 Sonnet, in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock console</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Introduction of Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet</u></strong><br /> Here are some key highlights about the new Claude 3 Sonnet model in Amazon Bedrock:</p> \n<p><strong>2x faster speed</strong> – Claude 3 has made significant gains in speed. For the vast majority of workloads, it is two times faster with the same level of intelligence as Anthropic’s most performant models, Claude 2 and Claude 2.1. This combination of speed and skill makes Claude 3 Sonnet the clear choice for tasks that require intelligent tasks demanding rapid responses, like knowledge retrieval or sales automation. This includes use cases like content generation, classification, data extraction, and research and retrieval or accurate searching over knowledge bases.</p> \n<p><strong>Increased steerability</strong> – Increased steerability of AI systems gives users more control over outputs and delivers predictable, higher-quality outcomes. It is significantly less likely to refuse to answer questions that border on the system’s guardrails to prevent harmful outputs. Claude 3 Sonnet is easier to steer and better at following directions in popular structured output formats like JSON—making it simpler for developers to build enterprise and frontier applications. This is particularly important in enterprise use cases such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/autonomous-mobility/\">autonomous vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/health/\">health and medical diagnoses</a>, and algorithmic decision-making in sensitive domains such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/financial-services/\">financial services</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Image-to-text vision capabilities</strong> – Claude 3 offers vision capabilities that can process images and return text outputs. It is extremely capable at analyzing and understanding charts, graphs, technical diagrams, reports, and other visual assets. Claude 3 Sonnet achieves comparable performance to other best-in-class models with image processing capabilities, while maintaining a significant speed advantage.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/03/04/2024-claude-3-sonnect-image-to-text.jpg\" width=\"1802\" height=\"736\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Expanded language support </strong>– Claude 3 has improved understanding and responding in languages other than English, such as French, Japanese, and Spanish. This expanded language coverage allows Claude 3 Sonnet to better serve multinational corporations requiring AI services across different geographies and languages, as well as businesses requiring nuanced translation services. Claude 3 Sonnet is also stronger at coding and mathematics, as evidenced by Anthropic’s scores in evaluations such as grade-school math problems (GSM8K and Hendrycks) and Codex (HumanEval).</p> \n<p>To learn more about Claude 3 Sonnet’s features and capabilities, visit <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\">Anthropic’s Claude on Amazon Bedrock</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-claude.html\">Anthropic Claude model</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Get started with Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock</u></strong><br /> If you are new to using Anthropic models, go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock console</a> and choose <strong>Model access </strong>on the bottom left pane.
