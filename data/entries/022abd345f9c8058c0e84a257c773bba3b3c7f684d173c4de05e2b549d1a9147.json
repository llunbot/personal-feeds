This year, a team of Canadian medical professionals checked to see if it’s any good at actual doctoring. And it’s not.</p>\n<h2>ChatGPT vs. Medscape</h2>\n<p>“Our source for medical questions was the Medscape questions bank,” said Amrit Kirpalani, a medical educator at the Western University in Ontario, Canada, who led the new research into ChatGPT’s performance as a diagnostic tool. The USMLE contained mostly multiple-choice test questions; Medscape has full medical cases based on real-world patients, complete with physical examination findings, laboratory test results, and so on.</p>\n<p>The idea behind it is to make those cases challenging for medical practitioners due to complications like multiple comorbidities, where two or more diseases are present at the same time, and various diagnostic dilemmas that make the correct answers less obvious. Kirpalani’s team turned 150 of those Medscape cases into prompts that ChatGPT could understand and process.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043636#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043636&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"022abd345f9c8058c0e84a257c773bba3b3c7f684d173c4de05e2b549d1a9147","category":"Tech"}
