As a Zigbee hub and Matter bridge, the device simplifies the integration of Aqara's Zigbee accessories with ‌HomeKit‌ and third-party Matter-compatible devices. The panel also supports real-time camera streaming, including footage from Aqara's doorbells.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Touchscreen Dial V1 builds upon the Panel Hub S1 Plus's capabilities by introducing a rotary dial and a smaller 1.32-inch round display. It allows for granular control of both wired lights and connected smart devices while maintaining compatibility with Apple ‌HomeKit‌ and Thread.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Doorbell Camera Hub G410 introduces several notable upgrades, including a 2K resolution sensor for sharper video, a 176-degree field of view, and built-in mmWave presence detection to reduce false alerts. It supports dual-band Wi-Fi, Thread, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, as well as options for secure storage via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, local microSD, or NAS.  It supports both battery-powered and wired setups.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Presence Multisensor FP300 combines PIR, ambient sensing, and mmWave technology to accurately detect human presence while monitoring light, temperature, and humidity. Similarly, the Climate Sensor W100 provides precise monitoring of temperature and humidity, with an e-ink display for secondary data and additional buttons for smart device control. Both sensors support Thread and Matter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe company also introduced the Light Switch H2 and the Dimmer Switch H2 with Thread and Zigbee support. They are designed to accommodate a wider range of home wiring configurations, including setups without a neutral wire. Thread compatibility ensures faster response times and more reliable connectivity, particularly in ‌HomeKit‌ environments where Thread is already widely utilized.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first wave of products, including the Panel Hub S1 Plus (EU version) and Touchscreen Dial V1 (EU version), are set to launch this month, with additional models and U.S. versions rolling out throughout 2025.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aqara/\">Aqara</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">CES 2025</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/aqara-unveils-new-homekit-accessories/\">Aqara Unveils New HomeKit-Compatible Panels, Sensors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/aqara-unveils-new-homekit-compatible-panels-sensors-and-more.2446797/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a49f2657a8edadcd035efc6e59be5d6b2f4af37e4db2a08f7c6eb89db650359","category":"Apple"}
