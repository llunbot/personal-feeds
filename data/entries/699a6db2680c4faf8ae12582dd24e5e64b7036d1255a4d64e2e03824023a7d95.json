Now, Google is rolling out a web-based portal to let people easily test if a piece of media has been watermarked with SynthID.</p>\n<p>After uploading a piece of media to the SynthID Detector, users will get back results that \"highlight which parts of the content are more likely to have been watermarked,\" Google said. That watermarked, AI-generated content should remain detectable by the portal \"even when the content is shared or undergoes a range of transformations,\" the company said.</p>\n<p>The detector will be available to beta testers starting today, and Google says journalists, media professionals, and researchers can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17AiEqHpgnp7GwsIfQNFLCB-5nSr7YxnLI_4jmm7kBGU/viewform?edit_requested=true\">apply for a waitlist</a> to get access themselves. To start, users will be able to upload images and audio to the portal for verification, but Google says video and text detection will be added in the coming weeks.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-launches-online-portal-to-detect-watermarked-ai-content/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-launches-online-portal-to-detect-watermarked-ai-content/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"699a6db2680c4faf8ae12582dd24e5e64b7036d1255a4d64e2e03824023a7d95","category":"Tech"}
