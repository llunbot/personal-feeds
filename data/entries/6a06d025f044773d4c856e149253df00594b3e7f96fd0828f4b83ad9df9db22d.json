Fast forward to February 2024, and the news is official. Anyone who purchased an <em>aftermarket</em> set of SRAM 12-speed shifters should take note. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the original bulletin mentioned an excess of thread locker on the clamp bolts as the cause for the recall, the actual CPSC recall notice simply says, “the clamp bolt on the brake lever can come loose, posing a crash hazard to the rider.” This recall applies to all SRAM 12-speed dropbar levers that were sold as aftermarket upgrade or replacement kits. Basically, if they weren’t included on a new bike and installed by a dealer, the levers are included in the recall. That includes SRAM eTap AXS Red, Force, Rival, and Apex shift-brake levers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the fix for most users should be pretty simple. Based on <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/contentassets/108e5e43274d43089f204544bb8b2c30/Shifter-Brake-Clamp-Assembly-Bolt-Recall-Consumer-Notice.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM’s recall page</a>, the issue is still the amount of thread locker used, and they’ve devised a simple procedure to work through the excess – a process that most people should be able to complete at home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the process outlined in the video above, you simply loosen the clamp bolt two full turns, torque it down to 6nm, then repeat the process two to three times to remove excess threadlocker. Then loosen the fixing bolt three full turns, adjust to position, and tighten to 6nm. If this doesn’t keep the lever in place, you’ll have to take it into your local dealer. Also, if you’re not sure of your abilities to perform the procedure adequately, or lack the proper tools, you should also take it into your local dealer and they’ll get you squared away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/SRAM-Recalls-Shift-Brake-Levers-Due-to-Crash-Hazard\" target=\"_blank\">cpsc.gov</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-shifter-recall-gets-official-applies-to-all-aftermarket-12-speed-dropbar-shifters/\">SRAM Shifter Recall Gets Official, Applies to All Aftermarket 12-Speed Dropbar Shifters</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6a06d025f044773d4c856e149253df00594b3e7f96fd0828f4b83ad9df9db22d","category":"Cycling"}
