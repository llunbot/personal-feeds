It's unclear if or when the $999 stand will be in stock again, or if this hints at an upcoming refresh to the Pro Display XDR, which was released in December 2019.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Pro-Display-XDR-Without-Stand.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><div><em>Christian Selig's tongue-in-cheek photo of a Pro Display XDR without the Pro Stand</em></div>\r<br />\nThe stand remains available on Apple's online store in some other countries, such as the U.K. and Canada, but it faces a 2-3 week shipping estimate or longer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Pro Display XDR itself also faces a lengthy shipping delay. In the U.S., Apple currently provides a late September delivery estimate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere haven't been any credible rumors about a new Pro Display XDR launching imminently, but in December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working on multiple new monitors, including an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/\">updated Pro Display XDR</a>. The nearly four-year-old monitor features a 32-inch screen with 6K resolution, and starts at $4,999 without the Pro Stand. For the next model, customers are hoping for a webcam, speakers, and a higher refresh rate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March 2022, Apple released a more affordable Studio Display with a 27-inch screen and 5K resolution, and it remains in stock on the company's online store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced that it will be holding an event <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">on Tuesday, September 12</a>, but Mac-related announcements are more likely in October. At the September event, Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 15 series, new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra models, and updated AirPods with a USB-C charging case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> According to <em><a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/01/the-pro-display-xdr-stand-being-out-of-stock-is-unsurprising\">AppleInsider</a></em>'s Mike Wuerthele, the Pro Stand has been out of stock at least seven times since September 2022, including most of January, and half of February. Therefore, this appears to be another routine shortage, and is unlikely to be indicative of an imminent Pro Display XDR refresh.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/apple-sold-out-of-pro-stand/\">Apple Currently Sold Out of $999 Pro Stand for Pro Display XDR [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-currently-sold-out-of-999-pro-stand-for-pro-display-xdr-updated.2400181/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec95621d27a0d2fbbbf1f873b95ad5136e2aaaee6cac4c575f3676179c0992bf","category":"Apple"}
