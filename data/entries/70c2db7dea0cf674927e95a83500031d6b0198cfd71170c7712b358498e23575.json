With less than five hours remaining in the countdown to launch, during a routine procedure, 13 of the 24 valves that control the flow of dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer through the service module of the spacecraft would not cycle between closed and open.</p>\n\n<p>An initial diagnostic effort at the launch pad yielded no results, so the Atlas V rocket and spacecraft were rolled back to an integration facility. After more inspection and testing there, engineers decided to \"de-stack\" the spacecraft and return it to Boeing's spacecraft processing building at Kennedy Space Center. This eventually led to further dissection of the vehicle and removal of several valves.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805902#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805902&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70c2db7dea0cf674927e95a83500031d6b0198cfd71170c7712b358498e23575","category":"Tech"}
