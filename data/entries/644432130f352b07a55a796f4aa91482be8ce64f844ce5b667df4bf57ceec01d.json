But it’s even better at today’s all-time-low price: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B09G9CJM1Z/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 64GB iPad for $250</a>, a savings of $79 and matching the best price we’ve ever seen for this model.
