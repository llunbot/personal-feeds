After falling off your bike, skin abrasion or a graze of this kind is hard to avoid.</p>\n<p>But you can mitigate skin damage immediately after and in the days following a cycling crash. Otherwise, you risk discomfort, infection and long-term scarring.</p>\n<p>We’ll explain below how to look after your road rash yourself with advice from St John Ambulance. The charitable first aid organisation supports the UK’s National Health Service at public events, including organised bike rides.</p>\n<p>In the event of a bad crash, you should call an ambulance or go to Accident and Emergency to get checked over for potentially more serious injuries. Look out for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/health/concussion-and-cycling/\">signs of concussion</a> too.</p>\n<h2>What is road rash and what causes it?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dutch Fabio Jakobsen of Soudal Quick-Step pictured after a crash at the finish of the fourth stage of the Tour de France cycling race, a 181,8 km race from Dax to Nogaro, France, Tuesday 04 July 2023.

This could be a large adhesive dressing or a bandage.</p>\n<p>“If you have a large injury, or fall off on dirt tracks, you may need a tetanus injection,” he adds.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ALTO DE LA MONTAÑA DE CULLERA, SPAIN - AUGUST 19: Detail view of a bandaged hand prior to the 76th Tour of Spain 2021, Stage 6 a 158,3km stage from Requena to Alto de la Montaña de Cullera 184m / @lavuelta / #LaVuelta21 / on August 19, 2021 in Alto de la Montaña de Cullera, Spain.

Phase two is covered during the day and open to the air at night. Third is unbandaged 24/7, dried up and scabbed over,” he explains.</p>\n<p>Dr Steffen adds that the scab’s disappearance will leave a pink epidermis. This outer layer of skin is not yet fully healed and overexposure to sunlight can cause pigment damage. So he recommends covering it up with sun cream or clothing and applying moisturiser.</p>\n<h2>Do you need specialist products to treat road rash?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Netherlands' Dutch Taco van der Hoorn of Intermarche-Circus-Wanty receives medical attention during the men's Tour of Flanders one day cycling event, 273,4km from Bruges to Oudenaarde, on April 2, 2023.
