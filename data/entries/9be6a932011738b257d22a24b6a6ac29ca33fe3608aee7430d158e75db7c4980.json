During its initial flights, the vehicle flew to an altitude of about 1,800 meters and reached a maximum speed of about 315 kilometers per hour, the company said.</p>\n<p>The test campaign, which is taking place from the Glentanner Aerodrome in New Zealand, will eventually see this vehicle top out at about 20 kilometers. The lessons learned from this plane will be put into a second version of the Mk-II Aurora, which could take flight before the end of this year or early in 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929210#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929210&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9be6a932011738b257d22a24b6a6ac29ca33fe3608aee7430d158e75db7c4980","category":"Tech"}
