The process features an online ’30 second quote’ calculator, as well as the option for collection and delivery with Sigma Sports partner, Flamme Rouge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the ever-rising price of new bikes, any steps to help bring the overall cost down is a welcome offer. For those unfamiliar with the term, part exchange is a payment system typically found in the car industry, where an old model is traded in and the estimated value is taken off the price of the new model. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

to help create a more sustainable product cycle, as well as lowering the barriers to entry for top-tier bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For cycling, some brands already offer a part exchange scheme, notably Halfords, though Sigma Sports will be the biggest premium retailer to have adopted the idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

exchanged bikes can be traded in for either store credit or transferred directly towards the purchase of a new bike. The old bike will then go to the second-hand dealer, Cycle Exchange, who service and sell premium used bikes both online and in-store. For those after an even lower price, it’s worth noting that Cycle Exchange already offers a part exchange programme, though obviously for second-hand bikes. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sigma-sports-cycle-exchange-part-exchange\">Now you can part exchange your bike at Sigma Sports</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Charlotte Head &#124; Tech Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ec960ba026171aea753452f1195410876d7e42e46deca87f8798db1db72a01b8","category":"Cycling"}
