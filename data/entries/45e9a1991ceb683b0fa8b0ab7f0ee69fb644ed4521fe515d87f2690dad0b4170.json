Rather than using the C1 modem or another custom Apple chip, Apple plans to switch from using Qualcomm units to MediaTek ones. MediaTek is one of the few companies capable of designing 5G modems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2026, Apple will debut a new custom modem with support for mmWave 5G. The C1 does not have this capability. The modem with mmWave support will be used in iPhones and \"at least one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\" This project has the codename \"Ganymede.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe C1 currently falls short of Qualcomm's performance, and the report suggests its direct 2026 successor will be the same. It will not be until a third generation in 2027 that Apple will \"finally be able to exceed the performance of Qualcomm's modems.\" This project is codenamed \"Prometheus.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile this information appears to have been sourced independently, it corroborates previous rumors. In December, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/\">reported</a> that Apple's second-generation 5G modem will add mmWave support and debut in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 18 lineup in 2026 and come to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> by 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe said the second modem will achieve theoretical download speeds of up to 6 Gbps, compared to up to 4 Gbps for Apple's first modem. He also alluded to Apple's wish for its third-generation modem to surpass Qualcomm's modems in terms of performance and AI features in 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/apple-watch-ultra-3-satellite-connectivity/\"><em>Bloomberg</em> report</a> mentioned Apple's plan to transition to MediaTek modems in the Apple Watch. MediaTek's modem adds support for 5G RedCap, a 5G service that's designed for connected devices and wearables that don't need standard 5G speeds. The current cellular Apple Watch models still use 4G LTE.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-versus-qualcomm-a-split-looms-for-techs-rockiest-marriage\"><em>The Information</em></a>'s full article details Apple's tumultuous relationship with Qualcomm and how it developed the all-new C1 chip.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/c1-is-just-the-start-of-changes/\">Report: Apple's C1 Is Just the Beginning of Modem Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apples-c1-is-just-the-beginning-of-modem-changes.2449881/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"45e9a1991ceb683b0fa8b0ab7f0ee69fb644ed4521fe515d87f2690dad0b4170","category":"Apple"}
