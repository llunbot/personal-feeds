Turns out, it’s not that hard to make our trails more accessible to a wider range of riders, letting all of your friends enjoy the same awesome experience you and I enjoy every time we hit the singletrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the warm fuzzies, there’s often good money and resources available to help make it happen, too, which means more trails for your area!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guests today are Nick Bennett and Greg Durso, two of the riders and trail builders leading Vermont’s charge to make more of their hundreds of miles of trails accessible to adaptive riders. I’ve ridden some of these trails, and they’re awesome. But what makes them super rad is that every rider can enjoy them, and trust me, they are not watered down in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered what it would take to make your local trails adaptive bike friendly, or what it’s like to experience a trail from their perspective, this episode is for you. Scroll down for links and more pics of Greg shredding!</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h2>Vermont Adaptive MTB Resources, Pics &amp; Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few more resources and their social accounts to learn (and see)

Both those and these Vermont trails were super fun to ride, there was nothing about them that left me (as a fully able-bodied rider) wanting. If you’re involved in trail building, check out the links above for resources, and reach out to Greg, Vermont Adaptive, and VMBA, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Want More?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find every episode of the BikeRumor Podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bikerumor-podcast/id1455519558\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bikerumor-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Podbean</a>, and through <a href=\"https://feed.podbean.com/bikerumor/feed.xml\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>, or wherever you listen to podcasts! Hit like, hit subscribe, and hit play!
