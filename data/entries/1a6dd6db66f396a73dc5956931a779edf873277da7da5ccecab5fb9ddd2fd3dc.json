But there's nothing stopping them from doing so, I might suggest.

It's small, but it's something.</p>\n<p>Direct from Microsoft, you can now buy a half-dozen <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xbox-repair-parts?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;ranSiteID=nOD_rLJHOac-ifRLa0gytyeVTFYASbyM6g&amp;epi=nOD_rLJHOac-ifRLa0gytyeVTFYASbyM6g&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AIDcmm549zy227_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__d63jjupsn9kfd0wanwiudjeegu2xer6w9du0avld00)(7593)(1243925)(nOD_rLJHOac-ifRLa0gytyeVTFYASbyM6g)()&amp;irclickid=_d63jjupsn9kfd0wanwiudjeegu2xer6w9du0avld00\">Xbox repair and replacement parts</a> for both the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 and the standard Xbox Wireless Controller. Each controller has top cases and button replacement sets in black and white, plus the two inner circuit boards that provide charging, input, vibration, and, of course, sockets with new potentiometers installed to fix stick drift.</p>\n<p>Parts on their own aren't that helpful to most of us, though, so Microsoft is also providing <a href=\"https://compass-ssl.xboxlive.com/assets/9e/85/9e85bcd6-9070-4d0a-901b-622c73247bb4.pdf?n=Elite-Series-2-Instructions.pdf\">written</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od71PV4X5A4\">video guides</a>. The videos are essentially full teardowns of each controller. The Elite Series 2 requires a plastic pry tool (aka spudger), a T6 and T8 screwdriver, and tweezers. The videos are helpful and aimed at all skill levels. \"Always push away from yourself when using pry tools, so if you slip you won't harm yourself\" is advice I have refused to accept a number of times.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958033#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958033&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a6dd6db66f396a73dc5956931a779edf873277da7da5ccecab5fb9ddd2fd3dc","category":"Tech"}
