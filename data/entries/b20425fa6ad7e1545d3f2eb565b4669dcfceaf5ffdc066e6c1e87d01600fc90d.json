{"title":"iOS 17.3's Collaborative Apple Music Playlist Feature Includes Animated Emoji Reactions","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/","date":1702504440000,"content":"With the iOS 17.3 update, Apple reintroduced the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/\">collaborative Apple Music playlist</a> feature, allowing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> users to build playlists with friends, family, and others who share their musical tastes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-music-collaborative-playlist-emoji.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nFor context, Apple initially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/\">tested collaborative playlists in iOS 17.2</a>, but ended up pulling the feature from the fourth beta prior to when iOS 17.2 was released. Apple said on Monday that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/\">would instead be launching in 2024</a>, and on Tuesday, collaborative playlists showed up in the iOS 17.3 beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new implementation allows all of the collaborators on a specific playlist to provide emoji reactions, similar to how tapback reactions work in Messages. To add an emoji reaction, play a collaborative playlist and then while a song is in progress, you can tap on the music player to see the emoji interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are standard emoji reactions to choose from like heart and thumbs up, but tapping on the \"+\" button allows you to choose from any of the available emoji options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>iOS 17.3 Beta 1 adds Emojis reactions to Collaborative Playlists ‚ÄºÔ∏è<br /><br />Emoji Animations are insane ü§™ <a href=\"https://t.co/RIQWYByfRE\">pic.twitter.com/RIQWYByfRE</a></p>‚Äî Kevin Aubin (@kaubin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaubin/status/1735005903630311449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 13, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nWhen you play a song that others have added emoji reactions to, you can see those emoji pop up from the emoji interface.
