So, Restrap developed the pack for racers to carry all of the food and water they need for intense endurance racing. But, it’s also a great option for regular riders looking to set some personal fast-packing records. Or just those cyclists venturing out into more remote, unspoiled areas to ride where refuel options are few and far between.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Restrap Race Hydration Vest lightweight bikepacking pack</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Restrap Race Hydration Vest lightweight ultra-distance endurance bikepacking pack, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-backpack_detail.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Restrap)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We see more and more off-road riders (and runners) taking advantage of the latest crop of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=hydration+vest\" target=\"_blank\">hydration vests</a> – mixing up a lighter-weight adaptation of the classic mountain bike hydration backpack. Restrap’s new Race Hydration Vest is the latest to combine generous front chest pocket storage with a hydration bladder and a bit more storage on your back.

Overall, it combines their years of experience handcrafting expedition-ready bikepacking packs and more urban &amp; utility-focused backpacks. The result then, is a light vest pack – it weighs just 368g (S/M) to 380g (L/XL) without the 146g bladder – that hugs your body as you pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Restrap describes it as the perfect solution for “<em>riders who need to carry extra fuel and hydration on longer, remote rides and ultra-endurance races</em>“. Therefore, they designed and developed the new Race Hydration Vest working closely with their team of endurance ambassadors. “<em>The Race Hydration Vest proved instrumental in our <strong>North Race</strong> Campaign, where ambassador Josh Reid cycled 315 miles (506 km) in 24 hours, with a mere 62 minutes of stopping time throughout. He was able to achieve this by carrying all the nutrition and hydration with him, keeping stopping time to a minimum.</em>” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Restrap Race Hydration Vest lightweight ultra-distance endurance bikepacking pack, The North Race from Restrap HQ\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_North-Race-out-of-Restrap-HQ.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More at <a href=\"http://northrace.co.uk/\">NorthRace.co.uk</a> if you are up for some silly self-managed competition in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Restrap Race Hydration Vest lightweight bikepacking pack, side &amp; back views\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Restrap-Race-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-bikepacking-pack_views-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, the Restrap Race Hydration Vest is there to make sure you stay fueled up for whatever cycling adventure you get up to.
