Checkpoints are given only a few days before the race, and this leads to a bombardment of messages and route ideas for the following days. While the routes are normally between 60-100 miles, due to the inflow of rain and snow, checkpoint locations were limited.</p>\n<p>With only about 50 miles on tap for the second race of the year, it was the rain, fog, and mud that made this seemingly “easy” race challenging. As well as the extremely steep climbing, with most routes packing 7500 ft of elevation into around 21 miles.</p>\n<p>Photographers Stephanie Ortega and Traece Craig captured as much of the race as a spectator could and truly highlighted the challenge of the race while capturing the community and comradery that the race offers.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LA_TOURIST_2_23_WEB_196.jpg?width=721\" alt width=\"721\" height=\"1080\" /></figure>\n<h1>Stephanie Ortega</h1>\n<p>Steph pulled double and triple duty between photos, registration, and checkpoint verification.
