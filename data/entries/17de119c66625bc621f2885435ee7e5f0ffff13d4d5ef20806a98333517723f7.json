The V5Rs supersedes the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/colnago-v4rs-review\">V4Rs</a> that has been<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-tour-of-flanders-colnago-v4rs\"> ridden by Tadej Pogačar</a> to multiple Grand Tour and Monument victories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago claims the new frame (including fork) is 146g lighter thanks to the use of Finite Elemental Modelling and mandrels that allow for more precise pre-forming. This has been done without significantly impacting on overall stiffness, with Colnago claiming that raised seatstays reclaim some of this rigidity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-22-970x639.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-22-970x639.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-22-300x198.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-22-768x506.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-22-750x494.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-22.webp 983w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tube shapes have changed throughout the bike, with the frontal area now reduced by 13% against the V4Rs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these alterations to the tube profiles are in pursuit of improved aerodynamics. Colnago reports a nine-watt saving over the V4Rs riding at 50kmh with a mannequin in place. This drops to three watts at the lower speed of 35kmh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though slight, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\">geometry</a> has been made more aggressive and clearance has increased to accommodate nominal 32mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for complete bikes range from £9,000 with SRAM Force AXS to £15,000 for a Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 build with Pogačar’s preferred Enve SES 4.5 wheels or full Campagnolo. Framesets are available for £5,500.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Colnago V5Rs weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10-970x643.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10-970x643.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10-768x509.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10-750x497.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10-1140x755.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-10.webp 1464w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to new manufacturing techniques and changes to tube shapes, the frame kit of the Colnago V5Rs has come down in weight by 12.5%. Davide Fumagalli, head of product at Colnago, explains that this is part of a different overarching approach to the design of the V5Rs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The main structure of the V4Rs was high strength carbon fibre with some reinforcement of high modulus,’ he says. ‘Conversely, the main structure of the V5Rs is high modulus with some reinforcement of high strength carbon. So it’s a completely different approach.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago says it used Finite Elemental Modelling (FEM) to simulate engineering scenarios and material behaviour to discover where it was possible to shed weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-970x646.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-23.webp 986w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Following this, and once the pre-preg carbon is arranged in position, Colnago says the mandrels used allow for a precise formulation even when the tubing has tight junctions and low volume. This is said to minimise the amount of carbon used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also exploited was a new carbon lamination technique that Colnago says increases the precision layering of each piece of carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of tubing, the fork, headset, seatpost and seat tube are all thinner, which contributes to this overall weight saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Colnago V5Rs aerodynamics</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-15.webp 1457w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carried over from its development of the Y1Rs for Colnago’s sponsored UAE teams is an improved CFD model, which Colnago claims is 15% closer to tracking real world air flow conditions. This involved drilling 70 holes in a range of 3D printed bikes in order to measure air pressure at different points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to a significant 13% reduction in the bike’s frontal area. The V5Rs’s 24.902mm<sup>2</sup> leading edge is 3.796mm<sup>2</sup> smaller than that of the V4Rs, though the aerodynamic advantages are proportionally far smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If we exclude the Y1Rs, this is the most aerodynamic bike we have ever made,’ says Fumagalli.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final prototypes were wind-tunnel-tested with the results positioning the V5Rs squarely between its predecessor the V4Rs and the heavier, aero-focussed Y1RS.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"276\" height=\"227\"

Wind Average Drag (WAD) of the V5Rs was nine watts fewer than the V4Rs, and 16 watts more than the Y1Rs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the more real-world speed of 35kmh this drops to just three watts, with returns diminishing yet further at lower speeds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

remodelled to improve aerodynamics or to save weight, another departure from the V4Rs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Before we were looking for stiffness by increasing the dimensions of the tubes, reducing wall stiffness and wall thickness.

This guarantees a much better compaction of carbon fibre, because you lay up the fibre already in the right position meaning you don’t have voids.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are improvements to the precision of the process, environmentally it has the potential to be more wasteful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The downside is that every time you change the layup, you have to throw away the mandrel because this is calibrated specifically for the carbon fibre,’ says Fumagalli. ‘If you want to add one layer of 0.1mm thickness, you cannot use it anymore. You need to scrap it and make a new one. So it’s a more expensive and longer process.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-970x646.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-16.webp 1462w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork blade has a new profile, which is thinner and contributes to that smaller overall frontal area.

You can use a lot of third-party handlebars because it’s a standard setup.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago says the thinner seatpost is entirely new, while the seat stays have been modified and raised, which should reduce the amount of flex at the bike’s rear end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Colnago V5Rs geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"469\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-19.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-19.webp 469w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-19-300x196.webp 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"469\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-20.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-20.webp 469w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-20-300x155.webp 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes to geometry are slight but push the V5Rs in a slightly more aggressive direction. The head tube and seat tube angles are steeper, positioning the rider further forward over the pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The geometry is pretty much the same as the V4Rs if you only look at the stack and reach numbers, and the position of the saddle and bars are also very similar,’ says Fumagalli. ‘We are talking about a difference of around 2mm. What’s changed quite a lot is the smaller sizes. We have now made the forks size specific. That means a change of the rake of the smaller sizes in order to make the ride quality consistent.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, with a view to making handling more responsive, especially on smaller bikes, Colnago will fit two different length fork rakes depending on size: 47mm for 420-510 and 43mm for 530-570mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17-970x643.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17-970x643.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17-768x509.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17-750x497.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17-1140x756.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-17.webp 1455w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyre clearance has been extended to a nominal 32mm, though Colnago says it’s not something the UAE teams have been pushing for, nor is it exactly set in stone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our teams did a lot of testing with much bigger tyres and found their sweet spot around 28/30mm on wide rims. It’s difficult to equivocally define the tyre clearance,’ says Fumagali. ‘Everyone is measuring tyres in a different way. That’s why we say 32mm because that’s what we can absolutely guarantee, but you can probably fit 34mm tyres onto the V5Rs.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The V5Rs comes in seven sizes, running seat tube lengths of 42, 45.5 and 48.5 and then 51, 53, 55, and 57.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Colnago V5Rs stiffness</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-18-970x625.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-18-970x625.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-18-300x193.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-18-768x495.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-18-750x483.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-18-1140x734.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-18.webp 1509w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We don’t care about the overall <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-frame-stiffness\">stiffness</a> like other brands or testing magazines,’ says Fumagalli. ‘We care about specific stiffness, which is what we targeted. Overall stiffness is slightly less than on the V4Rs but the handling stiffness is better. Generally speaking, it’s pretty similar.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check the stiffness of the V5Rs prototypes, Colnago coined something called Real-Dynamic Stiffness (RDS): a method of assessing the different load scenarios and stress impacts on the frameset when riders are pedalling in and out of the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-970x645.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-1140x758.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-14.webp 1461w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Colnago had decided to reduce the width of the seat tube to improve aerodynamics, it was necessary to reclaim any resulting loss of stiffness. The solution is an uplift for the seatstays to increase the rigidity of the rear triangle. Though Fumagalli says it is more complex than this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Here we are talking about a completely different structure of the carbon fibre,’ he says. ‘We’ve been able to use a bit less high modulus and a bit more high strength in that part of the frame. A lot of things went into that decision. The seat stays aren’t dramatically higher, maybe 1.52cm depending on the size.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Colnago, the head tube and down tube shapes have also been modified to reduce compliance and increase road feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stiffness obtained elsewhere has allowed Colnago to fit a slightly narrower BSA bottom bracket.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Colnago V5Rs specs and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-21-970x640.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-21-970x640.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-21-300x198.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-21-768x507.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-21-750x495.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-21-1140x752.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/image-21.webp 1461w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top spec Colnago V5Rs in the UK is a full Campagnolo build and a Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 setup with Enve SES 4.5 wheels, which both cost £15,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two further Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 builds, with Shimano C50 wheels and Vision SC45 wheels, priced at £13,000 and £10,000 respectively.
