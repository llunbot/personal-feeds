We know that nighttime screentime is bad, but it’s so hard to cut it out of our routine. And now Roka says they have a solution – something that will let us keep checking social media and streaming the latest binge-worthy shows, and still help improve our rest and recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Roka Wind Down eyewear block harmful light from screens</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Roka x Huberman Lab Wind Down eyewear blocks harmful blue light from electronic screens for better sleep &amp; recovery, Andrew Huberman\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_Dr-Andrew-Huberman-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Roka)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, we’ve all heard from doctors &amp; scientists for years that staring at your TV, laptop, and mobile phone just before you go to sleep is super bad for sleep quality. Everyone tells us the short blue &amp; green wavelength artifical light messes with our brain and disrupts our natural circadian rhythm after the sun goes down.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, most of us have failed to do anything about it. We’re seriously too addicted to screens at this point to completely cut them out of our nighttime routine, even faced with real consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roka x Huberman Lab Wind Down eyewear blocks harmful blue light from electronic screens for better sleep &amp; recovery, wavelength blocking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-297x134.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-1536x691.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-120x54.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-768x346.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_the-science-behind-green-blue-wavelenght-blocking-2048x922.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now paired with Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman, Roka created a broad new collection of Wind Down glasses with special orange-red lenses filtering out 400-520nm wavelength light aiming to boost sleep quality in order to improve rest, recovery, and overall mental &amp; physical health. Roka claims this wider blue AND green blocking is what sets them apart as better than other blue-blocking lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Improving health &amp; quality of life through rose-glasses?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some pretty bold claims from both Roka and the doc’s Huberman Lab. Yet, they clearly aren’t the first to tout the powerful effects – good &amp; bad – that different types of light have on the human body.  And, even if it is only plausible to “<em>lower stress levels</em>“, “<em>sync circadian rhythm</em>“, “<em>get better sleep</em>“, and “<em>help protect your mood</em>” just by wearing a pair of red-tinted Roka Wind Down glasses in the evening, it’s worth trying, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_seeing-red-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_seeing-red-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Roka x Huberman Lab Wind Down eyewear blocks harmful blue light from electronic screens for better sleep &amp; recovery, seeing red\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_seeing-red-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_seeing-red-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_seeing-red-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_seeing-red-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Full disclosure</em>: I’m by no means a specialist in light or human biology. This could be some serious snake oil for sale. And neither I nor Bikerumor are getting paid in any way to hype this (not even any affiliate kickbacks!) But, I totally stare at my stupid phone almost every night before I go to sleep, even though I know I shouldn’t. So, I’m game to try out Wind Down.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wind Down for everyone – Standard, Rx Prescription &amp; Magnifying Readers</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Roka x Huberman Lab Wind Down eyewear blocks harmful blue light from electronic screens for better sleep &amp; recovery, evening staring at the phone\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_for-evening-phone-and-computer-use-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A great part of the Roka Wind Down eyewear collection to me is that they are available in so many options to suit any and everyone. Roka will put standard non-prescription Wind Down lenses into 23 different frames, single-vison prescription Wind Down lenses into 17 frames, and simple low-cost magnification Wind Down reader lenses into 3 frames. All feature simple monochromatic or dark-colored frames to look good with the red lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Roka Wind Down  – Pricing &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Roka x Huberman Lab Wind Down eyewear blocks harmful blue light from electronic screens for better sleep &amp; recovery, Barton angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roka-Wind-Down-eyewear-blocks-harmful-blue-light-from-electronic-screens-for-better-sleep-and-recovery_barton-red-angled-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing starts at just $95 for non-prescription Wind Down glasses, and climbs up to $195 for the fanciest frames.
