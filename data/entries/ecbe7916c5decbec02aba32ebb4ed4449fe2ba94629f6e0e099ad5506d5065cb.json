And while Twitch now says it \"missed the mark with... policy language\" that was \"overly broad,\" many major streamers are still up in arms over a policy they say could severely affect their ability to make money from content on the popular <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/amazon-not-google-reportedly-buying-twitch-for-1-billion/\">Amazon-owned</a> streaming platform.</p>\n<p>In a June 6 update to <a href=\"https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/branded-content-policy?language=en_US\">its Branded Content Policy guidelines</a> (that Twitch says it will start enforcing on July 1), the platform said that so-called \"burned in\" videos, display banners, or audio ads are not permitted on the platform. These ad formats are popular with many major streamers, who sell a portion of their screen real estate as part of overall branded stream sponsorship deals.</p>\n<p>While basic sponsor logos will still be allowed to be shown on these streams, those sponsorships \"are limited to 3% of screen size\" under the new guidelines. That could be a problem for some disabled streamers because, as blind streamer Steve Saylor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevesaylor/status/1666200826791043080\">pointed out</a>, that size \"isn't accessible for low vision users as it is too small for overlays and even smaller on mobile.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946111#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946111&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ecbe7916c5decbec02aba32ebb4ed4449fe2ba94629f6e0e099ad5506d5065cb","category":"Tech"}
