{"title":"Pandemic lessons: More health workers, less faxing—an Ars Frontiers recap","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944284","date":1685745064000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>Our panel on pandemic lessons included Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo (center) and Dr. Caitlin Rivers (right). </p></div>\n<p>In many ways, modern advancements stole the show in the COVID-19 pandemic. With unprecedented speed, researchers decoded and shared the genetic blueprints of SARS-CoV-2. They developed highly effective, safe vaccines and treatments. Near real-time epidemiological data were at people's fingertips, and global genetic surveillance for viral variants reached unrivaled heights.</p>\n<p>But while the marvels of modern medicine and biotechnology wowed, the US struggled with the basics. Health departments were chronically underfunded and understaffed. Behind slick COVID-19 dashboards, health workers shared data in basic spreadsheets via email—and even fax machines. Long-standing weaknesses in primary care deepened health inequities. And useful pandemic prevention tools, like masks, became maligned in the disconnect between communities and local health departments.</p>\n<p>At our Ars Frontiers conference this year, I virtually sat down with two leading experts in pandemic preparedness, who talked through these takeaways from the COVID-19 pandemic. I spoke with Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, the director of the Pandemic Center and a professor of epidemiology at Brown University’s School of Public Health, and Dr. Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and founding associate director of the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944284#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944284&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4fcb268a536a22a0d971f54733531ba0aaf700d7c6515667c3c0b52f0fc71030","category":"Tech"}
