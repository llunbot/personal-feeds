However, Masimo said that the ruling only applied to a discontinued module and charger. The distinction undermines Apple's claim of irreparable harm, so while the company won damages, the decision essentially removed Apple's chance to block Masimo's current products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo's current products, and the jury's verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,\" a Masimo spokesperson said in a statement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe trial came about due to Apple's countersuit in its ongoing legal battle with Masimo, which previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/\">won an import ban</a> on certain Apple Watch models over pulse oximetry patents. The infringement forced Apple to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-without-blood-oxygen/\">disable blood oxygen monitoring features</a> in Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US. The feature is also lacking in the US version of the Apple Watch Series 10. The Apple Watches remain fully functional outside of the country.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring the trial, Apple attorney John Desmarais claimed that monetary compensation wasn't the company's goal, telling jurors: \"We're not here for the money. We want them to stop copying our design.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn Apple spokesperson defended the company's position, saying: \"Teams at Apple worked for years to develop Apple Watch,\" while \"Masimo took shortcuts, launching a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes our intellectual property.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/\">Masimo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/\">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/27/apple-wins-250-masimo-watch-patent-trial/\">Apple Wins Symbolic $250 in Masimo Watch Patent Trial</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-symbolic-250-in-masimo-watch-patent-trial.2441087/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e59b1b1d3e84372664581796ce1bafe32c97c85eeadeb92b50e4d3537908d9c4","category":"Apple"}
