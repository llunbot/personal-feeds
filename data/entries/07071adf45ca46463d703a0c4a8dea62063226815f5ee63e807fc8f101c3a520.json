The ends simply rest in the dropout notches of the frame, then it expands from the center outward to match your hub’s width.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2.webp\" alt=\"granite designs chaindock dummy hub shown on a bike in a travel case.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that’s set, use the lock nut to fix the width, and insert your thru axle to keep it there during transit or cleaning. It prevents the rear stays from getting crushed inward, something your thru axle alone can’t really do since it slides in/out of the non-drive side.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3.webp\" alt=\"granite designs chaindock dummy hub shown on a bike being cleaned.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/granite-chaindock-dummy-hub-tool-3-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also makes it really easy to clean or lube your chain, or just keep it from dangling about while cleaning your frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch how it works here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also compatible with QR skewers and frames with the included adapters.
