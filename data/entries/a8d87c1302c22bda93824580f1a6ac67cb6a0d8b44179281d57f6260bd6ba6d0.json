And this makes sense, given that the violence of the supernova explosions that form these black holes ensures that only a fraction of the dying star's mass gets transferred into its dark offspring. But then the gravitational wave data started flowing in, and we discovered there were lots of heavier black holes, with masses dozens of times that of the Sun. But we could only find them when they smacked into another black hole.</p>\n<p>Now, thanks to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/esas-gaia-mission-set-to-survey-the-galaxy-with-biggest-camera-in-space/\">Gaia mission</a>, we have observational evidence of the largest black hole in the Milky Way outside of the supermassive one, with a mass 33 times that of the Sun. And, in galactic terms, it's right next door at about 2,000 light-years distant, meaning it will be relatively easy to learn more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017550#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017550&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a8d87c1302c22bda93824580f1a6ac67cb6a0d8b44179281d57f6260bd6ba6d0","category":"Tech"}
