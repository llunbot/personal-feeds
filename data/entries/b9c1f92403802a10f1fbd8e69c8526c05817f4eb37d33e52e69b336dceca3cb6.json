This will be largely driven by launches of upgraded Starlink satellites with the ability to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/spacex-details-starlink-for-phones-plan-launching-in-2024/\">connect directly with consumer cell phones</a>, a service SpaceX calls \"Starlink Direct to Cell,\" a company official told Ars this week.</p>\n<p>The goal next year is 12 launches per month, for a total of 144 Falcon rocket flights. Like this year, most of those missions will be primarily devoted to launching Starlink broadband satellites. So far in 2023, more than 60 percent of SpaceX's launches have delivered the company's own Starlink satellites into orbit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977473#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977473&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9c1f92403802a10f1fbd8e69c8526c05817f4eb37d33e52e69b336dceca3cb6","category":"Tech"}
