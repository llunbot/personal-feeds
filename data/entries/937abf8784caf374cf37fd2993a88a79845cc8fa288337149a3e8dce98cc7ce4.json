It seems that this is the new Shimano shoe theme, with special colorways and limited edition versions dropping every few months. As we get closer to Unbound, June 3rd, we expect to see more brands launching or showcasing new gravel-specific products.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7911-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7911.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7911.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>The RX8 is a performance gravel shoe, and the new colorway inspired by the Flint Hills of Kansas makes them a perfect choice for Unbound. </span></figcaption></figure>\n<h1>RX8 Twilight</h1>\n<p>Shimano sent me a pair of the new <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/?s=rx8\" target=\"_blank\">RX8</a> Twilight colorway. I have been riding the <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/shimano-sphyre-champagne/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano S-Phyre RC903S shoes</a> for a few weeks now, and these have a very similar fit and feel. My first impression of the colorway and design is that they are subtle but unique. With a closer look, you can see the small details in the design across the entire shoe. As I have said in the past, I’m not a fan of all-white shoes. I just can’t seem to keep them looking good, ever. So to have a slightly darker colorway is perfect, and the fade on these keeps them from being too boring too.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7904-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7904.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7904.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>A single BOA dial makes on-the-bike adjustments quick and easy.</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/first-look-shimano-flint-hills-edition-rx8-and-rx6-gravel-shoes/shimano-rx8-7905/\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7905.jpg\" alt loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7905.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7905.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/first-look-shimano-flint-hills-edition-rx8-and-rx6-gravel-shoes/shimano-rx8-7907/\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7907.jpg\" alt loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7907.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7907.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/first-look-shimano-flint-hills-edition-rx8-and-rx6-gravel-shoes/shimano-rx8-7908/\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7908.jpg\" alt loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7908.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7908.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/first-look-shimano-flint-hills-edition-rx8-and-rx6-gravel-shoes/shimano-rx8-7914/\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7914.jpg\" alt loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7914.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7914.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/first-look-shimano-flint-hills-edition-rx8-and-rx6-gravel-shoes/shimano-rx8-7915/\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7915.jpg\" alt loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7915.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7915.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></a>\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7912-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7912.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shimano-RX8-7912.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>The synthetic leather upper is said to be scratch resistant and has inkjet-printed graphics.<br />\n</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>While we don’t think the RX8 needs another full review, it should be stated that these shoes have very good breathability. Mix this with a closure that does a very good job of retaining the foot evenly while reducing the amount of dirt and rocks that can find a way into the shoes, and these are a top choice for me. Overall, $275 seems like a bargain since top-performance shoes in this same category are now over $400. At the same time, it is a lot to ask for a pair of shoes that are bound to have a lot of abuse. That is where the RX6 (below) might be the perfect balance of performance and price for many.</p>\n<h1>RX8 Specs</h1>\n<p>MSRP: US $275<br />\nWeight: My Size 44 is 303 grams<br />\nUS Regular Sizes: 38, 39, 40, 41, 42-45(half sizes), 46</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>From Shimano</em></p>\n<p>SHIMANO introduces Flint Hills Edition RX8 and RX6 gravel shoes to celebrate the iconic Kansas landscape</p>\n<p>Three colorful designs pay tribute to riders embarking on all-day and all-night journeys across the rolling Flint Hills each June.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the heartland of the American gravel scene, Shimano introduces limited-edition RX8 and RX6 Flint Hills gravel shoes to celebrate the early mornings and late nights that riders undertake while pushing their limits in Kansas each summer.
