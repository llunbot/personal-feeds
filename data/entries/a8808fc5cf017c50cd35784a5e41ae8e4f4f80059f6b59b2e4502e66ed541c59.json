This solves a few issues. First, in doing so, removes the tree hooks from the end of your bars, and second, they offer your hands multiple positions.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Instead of simply holding your grips, bar inners allows for a few more hand positions. This is particularly helpful during long climbs. While most people will put these sorts of accessories on ultra-endurance bikes, I’ve been loving bar inners on my trail bikes, and they’ve helped alleviate shoulder pain on our multi-hour-long singletrack climbs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Rogue Panda Bamboo Shoots</h3>\n<p>Bamboo Shoots are bar extensions meant to be installed inside your brake levers on a 22.2⌀ clamp handlebar. What makes these unique in the space is that they have sweep adjustment and a swing clamp. So, if you’re running a bar with a lot of back sweep, like these <a href=\"https://sklarbikes.com/collections/soft-goods-accessories/products/pbj-handlebar-riser-bar-for-alt-cyclists\" target=\"_blank\">Sklar PBJ bars</a>, you can adjust which angle the Bamboo Shoots sit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The swing clamp (thank god someone did this!) means you don’t have to remove your shifter, brakes, and grips when swapping them on or off your bike or between bikes. I’m super OCD about my brake levers, shifters, and grip positions. The Bamboo Shoots add another layer to this cockpit complexity, but the swing clamp makes them super easy to adjust.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-16.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Rogue Panda designed these to work with either a lock-on grip, or a trimmed down foam grip, of which you can buy from Rogue Panda for an additional $21. These trimmed foam grips are great because you can peel back the foam to access the 4 mm bolt for sweep adjustment. You could wrap them with your favorite bar tape, too.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Bamboo Shoots Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$180 a pair</li>\n<li>$21 WolfTooth foam grips trimmed to match</li>\n<li>Weight: 66 g per pair (confirmed)</li>\n<li>Made in Flagstaff, Arizona</li>\n<li>CNC-machined from 6061 aluminum</li>\n<li>Sweep adjustment is from 8º to 37º.</li>\n<li>Swing clamp mounts to 22.2⌀ mm bars</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>First Ride and Setup</h3>\n<p>Like I mentioned earlier, I’ve been really into the additional hand positions bar inners offer on flat bar bikes, and the Bamboo Shoots are another great option in that space. I’m on the road this week and took them for a ride in the Mojave Desert en route to Northern California to get them dialed in.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It took a while to get the Bamboo Shoots’ sweep adjustment completely symmetrical. Measuring from the grips’ ends to evenly land them on the bars was easy, and I can eyeball their vertical angle adjustment reasonably well. Of course, the test is always the camera, but even my grid overlay shows them to be pretty even. Once you do get the sweep adjustment dialed in, it should be easy to reinstall them. You could mark their previous position with a paint pen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-24.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>While the Bamboo Shoots add a layer of visual “interestingness” to bikes, I think they look pretty normal on a tourer like my Sklar PBJ. In fact, it looks even more like a “Desert Moose” – my nickname for the bike – or perhaps a <em>desert pronghorn</em> now.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-22.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Rogue-Panda-Bamboo-Shoots-Bar-Inners-Review-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Every bike will have a different bar inners setup. Some bikes with shorter reach numbers might benefit from them being flatter while other riders might like them more vertical. With easy adjustment, the Bamboo Shoots offer hand position options regardless of the bike or rider. While the Bamboo Shoots aren’t as ergonomic as the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/johns-favorite-products-2024/#:~:text=SQ%20Labs%20Innerbarends%20%2444.99\" target=\"_blank\">SQLabs InnerBarEnds</a> I’ve been using, with Wolf Tooth foam grips, they still feel plenty comfortable.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what’s gotten into Rogue Panda lately but their latest few product releases have been damn cool.
