Check Out the Flexbar","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/flexbar-touch-bar-replacement/","date":1733269976000,"content":"With <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pros/\">the 2016 MacBook Pro models</a>, Apple introduced the Touch Bar, a small multi-touch display available above the keyboard. The Touch Bar replaced the function row of keys and added dynamic buttons that changed for each app, but it was a polarizing feature that many Mac users disliked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple started phasing out the Touch Bar with the launch of the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> models, and the last Mac with a Touch Bar was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/\">discontinued in 2023</a>. If you're one of the ‌MacBook Pro‌ users who misses the Touch Bar, you'll want to take a look at <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1735591421/flexbar-a-versatile-and-fully-customizable-touch-bar-solution\">the Flexbar</a>, which is designed to be a Touch Bar replacement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Flexbar is a standalone touch-based hardware device that attaches to a Mac, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, or PC over USB-C. It has a customizable, adaptive interface that's modeled after the Touch Bar, and in terms of functionality, it's similar to multi-button PC and Mac add-ons like the Stream Deck.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/flexbar.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1036\" />\r<br />\nFlexbar features a 10-inch 2K OLED display and it comes equipped with preloaded shortcut combinations and controls tailored for popular apps. It supports third-party APIs and can allegedly offer \"advanced, native-like controls\" for YouTube, Microsoft apps, Adobe apps, AutoCAD, and more. Flexbar's creators say that a plugin system and marketplace are in development and slated to launch in the second quarter of 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the Touch Bar, the Flexbar is designed to automatically switch controls based on your current task window, but users can create their preferred layouts using a \"Workspace\" recording function. While the Touch Bar was limited to more basic controls, the Flexbar supports multi-step macros and sequences for repetitive tasks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Flexbar is a Kickstarter project from a Hong Kong-based company called <a href=\"https://eniacelec.com\">ENIAC</a>, so first and foremost, <em>MacRumors</em> readers should know that ENIAC has not previously created a hardware product. Taking hardware from prototyping to mass production is a difficult task that can lead to delays and even insurmountable issues, plus there are also software integration requirements, so we recommend waiting until the product launches to make a purchase.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is $120 to back the Flexbar now (shipping not included), and the product has been funded. The Kickstarter page lists an estimated delivery date of February 2025.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/flexbar-touch-bar-replacement/\">Miss the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar?
