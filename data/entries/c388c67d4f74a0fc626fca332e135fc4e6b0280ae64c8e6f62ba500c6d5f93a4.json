The first developer release landed on April 2, and we expect a wide release in May (or possibly late April).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last few iOS versions had their x.5 releases in May, with only minor features and changes, and we expect the same this year, especially now that the anticipated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2631137/apple-is-delaying-the-only-apple-intelligence-feature-everyone-wanted.html\">new Siri has been delayed</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated May 12:</strong> iOS 18.5 is now in wide release.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.5: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the big Siri enhancements pushed back out of the iOS 18 update cycle and the iOS 19 beta starting at WWDC in June, we don’t expect much in the way of major new features—just a few touch-ups, bug fixes, and security enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contact Photos in Mail –</strong> In the three-dot menu (…) you can quickly enable or disable contact photos in Mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen Time notifications –</strong> The parent device now receives a notification when a child device enters the Screen Time passcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Satellite on iPhone 13 –</strong> All models of iPhone 13 can support carrier-provided satellite connectivity features. These vary by carrier and region.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.5 release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update also includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A new Pride Harmony wallpaper</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Parents now receive a notification when the Screen Time passcode is used on a child’s device</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Buy with iPhone is available when purchasing content within the Apple TV app on a 3rd party device</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fixes an issue where the Apple Vision Pro app may display a black screen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support for carrier-provided satellite features is available on iPhone 13 (all models).
