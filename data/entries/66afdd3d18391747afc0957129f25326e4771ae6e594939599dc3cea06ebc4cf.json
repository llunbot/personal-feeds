Crafted during the Trump administration, the Biden White House reaffirmed these Artemis plans within days of taking office. Biden diplomats have also continued to add nations to the \"Artemis Accords,\" with two dozen countries now participating.</p>\n<p>For all of this support, however, there is one worrying sign. The Artemis program's budget is ballooning, and it is not at all clear when humans will start flying to the Moon. These concerns were highlighted this week at a meeting of NASA's Advisory Committee for Human Spaceflight.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939235#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939235&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66afdd3d18391747afc0957129f25326e4771ae6e594939599dc3cea06ebc4cf","category":"Tech"}
