Cycling is a huge passion of mine and several other staffers, and this year, a ton of intrigue surrounds the race, which has a <a href=\"https://inrng.com/2024/06/tour-de-france-2024-stage-profiles/\">fantastic route</a>. So we're here to spread Tour fever.</p>\n<p>The three-week race starts Saturday, paradoxically in the Italian region of Tuscany. Usually, there is a dominant rider, or at most two, and a clear sense of who is likely to win the demanding race. But this year, due to rider schedules, a terrible crash in early April, and new contenders, there is more uncertainty than usual. A solid case could be made for at least four riders to win this year's Tour de France.</p>\n<p>For people who aren't fans of pro road cycling—which has to be at least 99 percent of the United States—there's a great series on Netflix called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdNosghI3UI\"><em>Unchained</em></a> to help get you up to speed. The second season, just released, covers last year's Tour de France and introduces you to most of the protagonists in the forthcoming edition.
