Stage race season is ending, temperatures are dropping and the grind begins in earnest once more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week has been a big one for us, mainly thanks to the Vuelta coming to its conclusion and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Britain</a> taking over once again. We’ve celebrated by imagining <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-britain\" target=\"_blank\">what a British Grand Tour would look like</a> – with a full 21-stage route. We’ve also started looking ahead to the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/autumn-classics-guide\" target=\"_blank\">autumn Classics</a> season and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-romandie-feminin-preview\" target=\"_blank\">last big stage race of the women’s season</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere we’ve been getting into buyer’s guide season with a bit of revamping to our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-choosing-the-best-bike-lock\" target=\"_blank\">best bike locks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-kids-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">best kids’ bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">best endurance road bikes</a> guides as well as our guides to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-upgrades\" target=\"_blank\">best road bike upgrades</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike-upgrades\" target=\"_blank\">best gravel bike upgrades</a> – with plenty more still to come. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/nico-roche-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">latest episode of the Cyclist Magazine Podcast</a> also came out this week and it’s a scorcher, we were joined by Nico Roche, who spoke to us about the Vuelta, Tadej Pogačar and his racing career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get In the Drops.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>OnGuard RockSolid lock</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"onguard d lock locked\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-1-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OnGuard claims its new RockSolid lock is the world’s lightest angle-grinder resistant D lock (or U lock, whichever you prefer, but I prefer D lock because U implies it’s not actually locked). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s made from what OnGuard says is ultra-high-strength diamond-ceramic materials, with several extra layers of defence and a locking bolt that secures the crossbar in four places. The brand describes it as ‘virtually impervious to the cutting force of angle grinders’. It also has a thick rubber cover on the U bar to make it easy on your frame’s paint job.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"onguard rocksolid lock open\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Onguard-rocksolid-itd-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Sold Secure Diamond rated unsurprisingly and weighs just 1.4kg, which OnGuard says makes it the lightest angle grinder resistant lock available. On top of that it also features plenty of ergonomic touches, which makes it a pleasure to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tweekscycles.com%2Fonguard-rocksolid-u-lock-eukon-28590-9%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqiwmJ5I1GmjDyYOVFklTTWejnH1X3x67qFQwB1-BECDdRKLLeJ\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeks Cycles (£199.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/nico-roche-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 113: Nico Roche on Tadej Pogačar, La Vuelta and being the son of Stephen Roche</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-britain\">What would a three-week Tour of Britain route look like?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/angel-of-the-mountains-charly-gaul\">Cycling books: Angel of the mountains: The strange tale of Charly Gaul by Paul Maunder</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">Best endurance road bikes 2024 reviewed: Top picks for comfort on long rides</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2><em>King of Sports </em>by Peter Ward</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"king of sports book cover\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-1-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>King of Sports</em> was first written in 1967 and was Peter Ward’s guide to everything cycling, from lifestyle to racing and for beginners and experts alike. It includes yoga exercises, mechanics, race tactics, race organisation, nutrition and clothing advice and much more in between with graphs and diagrams to demonstrate including a fun pictogram of forming echelons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been described as the ‘encyclopaedia of cycling’ and this is the first time it has been republished for a modern audience. It’s not something to take word for word for your next training plan but it’s a lovely little insight into the past – and there might be a few useful things in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"King of Sports inside preview with diagrams on echelon formations\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/King-of-Sports-itd-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has some really nice old pictures of Ward and his contemporaries, as well as some of his stories, which he uses to demonstrate certain lessons. The book also finishes up with some of his most memorable events, including the tale of when he finished first at the National Championships but was disqualified (he thought unjustly) for being given an aspirin outside the official feed zone (he didn’t even consume it).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.pendle-press.co.uk/product/king-of-sports\" target=\"_blank\">Pendle Press (£15)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flo Aid Bag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"flo aid bag closed\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-1-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine having everything you need for all potential bike ride disasters in your saddle bag.

The products are Flo’s own so it really is a complete kit, the multi-tool has a load of useful functions including a tubeless plug, valve core tool, chain breaker, several hexes, Torx 20/25, spoke wrenches and a bottle opener. Flo says there is still space for a tube and/or CO2 canister but personal preference/shipping issues mean they’re not included.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"side by side shot of both halves of flo aid bag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/flo-aid-bag-itd-pair.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The First Aid side includes: Tegaderm dressings, a tourniquet, blister covers, plasters, gauze wrap and tape, saline, saddle cream, suncream, shears and gloves.

Not that football though, sorry. The NFL season kicked off last night after a long off-season. This year’s seven-month break felt longer than usual for me and many others because everyone’s favourite NFL podcast, Around the NFL, was unexpectedly cancelled by shadowy league figures with no explanation or official word. We waited and speculated before the end was finally announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its place has risen two shows, Gregg Rosenthal’s NFL Daily has officially taken the old podcast’s feed (and I am keeping up with that), but the magic of Around the NFL has been reborn in the form of the Heed the Call podcast with Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler and Justin Graver (plus guests). And it’s the real deal, it’s Around the NFL unshackled and set free and it saved the summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a fan of the NFL and you don’t already listen (chances are low) then I can’t recommend it enough. If you aren’t a fan, then it’s a great way to help get you into the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we’re here, it’s time for another In the Drops playlist of new music released since the last time I was here. It’s a compact edition this time out because I’ve been busy living, but it still has plenty of good music including new stuff from Fontaines DC, Sports Team and Sunflower Bean as well as a couple of exciting artists I’d not listened to before, Wunderhorse and The Dare. For good measure there are also picks from Post Malone’s country album and Sabrina Carpenter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while I’m here shoutout English Teacher for winning the Mercury Prize. </p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KbrFETqmbOTMlK4pfAoPm\" target=\"_blank\">In the Drops #22 on Spotify</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/1151659770/playlists\" target=\"_blank\">all my In the Drops playlists</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/nico-roche-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 113: Nico Roche on Tadej Pogačar, La Vuelta and being the son of Stephen Roche</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-britain\">What would a three-week Tour of Britain route look like?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/angel-of-the-mountains-charly-gaul\">Cycling books: Angel of the mountains: The strange tale of Charly Gaul by Paul Maunder</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">Best endurance road bikes 2024 reviewed: Top picks for comfort on long rides</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/onguard-rocksolid-lock\">In the Drops: OnGuard’s impressive new lock, ‘King of Sports’ book, Flo’s do-it-all bag and Heed the Call</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f936e80fc2ef3d0c4f7e7292b127d06088e3e0be622abb4a40ad432fb8966015","category":"Cycling"}
