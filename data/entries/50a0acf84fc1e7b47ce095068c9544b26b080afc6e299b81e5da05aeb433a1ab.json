Even with the tariff ‘pause’, we’re still already seeing the impact of them as big brands like Trek and Specialized raise prices to offset the increased cost of imported goods. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-launches-elettrico-micro-ultimate-electric-pumps-u-s-misses-out-due-to-tariffs/\" target=\"_blank\">Silca has decided not to offer their Electrico mini electric pumps in the U.S</a>. Borealis Bikes isn’t bringing in any inventory for 2025-26 season. Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rideblue\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Competition Cycles posted on Facebook </a>that they received a $1,519 bill for tariffs alone on an order of $894 worth of small parts. Even companies that completely make their products in the U.S. from U.S.-made materials like <a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-sea-otter-tariff-interviews-video/\" target=\"_blank\">Oveja Negra are having to layoff employees</a> because foreign buyers no longer want U.S.-made goods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mess is just beginning, but based on the fallout so far and the lingering post-Covid instability of many brands, it’s clear that a large portion of the bicycle industry won’t survive this long term. While not completely tariff-related, we’ve already seen one surprising brand fall <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-bikes-is-apparently-closing-just-after-launching-three-new-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">with the loss of Revel Bikes</a>, and the rumor is that there are much larger brands already teetering on the brink of collapse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the face of all this uncertainty and financial hardship, it’s not surprising to see PeopleForBikes stepping in to do what they can. It may seem like a futile effort, but the bicycle advocacy group has sent a formal letter to President Trump requesting tariff relief or an exclusion process for bicycles, components, apparel, and related accessories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re getting that feeling of deja vu, it’s likely because this whole situation is eerily similar to 2018 when Trump introduced tariffs on goods from China right before Interbike was set to open. Eventually, many brands and products were granted tariff exclusions, which is what PeopleForBikes hopes may happen again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the letter, PeopleForBikes expresses gratitude for the closing of the de minimus loophole, “which has undermined the U.S. bicycle industry and local bike retailers across America for years.” However, they point out that as it stands, the tariffs threaten to put many American companies out of business before they can ever hope to bring any sort of manufacturing back stateside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flipsnack.com/A6E9C6BBDC9/letter-to-president-trump/full-view.html\" target=\"_blank\">You can read the full letter here. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About PeopleForBikes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PeopleForBikes is a national bicycle advocacy nonprofit and the U.S. bicycle industry’s trade association representing more than 340 bicycle industry supplier members and nearly 1.4 million individual supporters.
