Next, I brought home those Gravity casing tires, and added some of their lighter Trail casing analogues. I then proceeded to ride them hard in all weather and all trail conditions to see if my glowing first impressions translated on home trails and familiar bikeparks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get ready to nerd out on a new mountain bike tire for a bit…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Schwalbe Albert Radial MTB tires, an In-Depth Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_tread-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_tread-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Albert Gravity Pro Radial enduro all-mountain bike tire review, tread detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_tread-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_tread-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_tread-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_tread-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_tread-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can simply say, this is the grippiest new all-rounder enduro mountain bike tire setup I’ve ridden in years, while still not feeling slow on the climbs.

But rest assured, the PR info and tech details from the staid Germans at Schwalbe were not nearly so enthusiastic. In fact, their communications on this new tire was super basic. They pretty much stuck to a simple description of the conventional 45° structure orientation vs. the new one that was “a smaller angle” closer to a true radial orientation. And of course, their claim of 30% increased contact patch area at the same pressure, or 10% more contact even at 7psi/0.5bar higher tire pressures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_up-close.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_up-close.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Albert Gravity Pro Radial enduro all-mountain bike tire review, close-up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_up-close.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_up-close-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_up-close-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_up-close-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_up-close-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I just really appreciate how the change in fabric orientation inside the tire is so simple, and yet it has such a big, noticeable impact on how the tire performs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why does (more) Radial construction matter?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Radial Trail Gravity mountain bike tires, bias-ply vs. more radial\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison-297x143.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-all-new-Schwalbe-Radial-Trail-and-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_thread-angles-comparison-768x369.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>conventional bias-ply (<em>l</em>) vs. more radial (<em>r</em>) – direction of travel facing up</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Schwalbe explains it by saying that their almost radial construction means ~25% shorter strands of the casing fabric from bead-to-bead. And that because of the ~15° orientation of these fibers (vs. conventional 45° bias-ply), those fibers in the tire casing extend only 1/4 the distance in the direction of the tire’s rotation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That effectively means that when an edge on the trail hits your tire, it only impacts 1/4 as many fibers across the cross-section of the tire casing at a time. And that results in much more localized deflection at the point of contact.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-mountain-bike-tire-Review_Albert-Gravity-local-tread-deformation_m.gif\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-mountain-bike-tire-Review_Albert-Gravity-local-tread-deformation_m.gif\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What you get is a structure where the tire knobs can fold over more closely to a trail obstacle, while also then allowing the entire large tire volume to spread the total impact force over a greater area of the tire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More local grip connecting the tread to the ground. Greater contact patch area at the same tire pressures. And greater damping of the rebound (or bounce) from the spike of air pressure inside the tire volume when hitting an obstacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Feel free to read more about the tech in my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-radial-trail-and-gravity-mountain-bike-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">original launch coverage, here</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much do they actually weigh?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Ultra-Soft_1406g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Ultra-Soft_1406g-actual-weight-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Albert Gravity Pro Radial enduro all-mountain bike tire review, actual weight 29er\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Ultra-Soft_1406g-actual-weight-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Ultra-Soft_1406g-actual-weight-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Ultra-Soft_1406g-actual-weight-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Ultra-Soft_1406g-actual-weight-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Ultra-Soft_1406g-actual-weight.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Soft_1368g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Soft_1368g-actual-weight-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Albert Gravity Pro Radial enduro all-mountain bike tire review, actual weight 29&quot;\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Soft_1368g-actual-weight-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Soft_1368g-actual-weight-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Soft_1368g-actual-weight-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Soft_1368g-actual-weight-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Gravity-Pro-Radial-MTB-tire_29x2-6in-Soft_1368g-actual-weight.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the lead-up to the Albert Radial product launch, Schwalbe didn’t actually send us any weight figures, simply stating that the new Radial construction did not change weights vs. their conventional tire construction.

I suspect this comes down to the slower rebound damping that Schwalbe described. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s more pronounced on super hardpack or big sections of smooth rock.

Plus, a 2-4psi difference in pressure has a real noticeable effect on both how the tire grips and how much support you feel in corners. And you can’t just squeeze the tires to feel if it’s correct, because increased local flexibility makes the tire feel softer at the same pressure than other conventional bias-ply tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it’s best to use a reliable/accurate pressure gauge, and start with around 5psi more than you would in a similar style of tire. Then, make any pressure changes in small increments. In the end, you’ll find more grip <em>AND</em> more support, most likely at slightly higher pressures than you would have thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Parting Thoughts on riding the new Schwalbe Albert Radial tires</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Albert Gravity Pro Radial enduro all-mountain bike tire review,   sidewall detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_gravity-Ultra-Soft-tires-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, these new Schwalbe Albert Gravity &amp; Trail Radials have done better than any other all-mountain or enduro tires that I have ridden in recent memory. They manage to deliver consistent, predictable grip across variable trail &amp; weather conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ride in loose or wet conditions all of the time, or need a conditions-specific race tire, you might need a more aggressive tread (like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-radial-trail-and-gravity-mountain-bike-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Mary or Shredda Radials</a>). But if you want one tire that you just put on the bike and just ride, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more versatile solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Albert Gravity Pro Radial enduro all-mountain bike tire review,  Ransom rock riding grip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Ransom-DH-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On that thought, I built this new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-scott-ransom-170mm-6-bar-enduro-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Ransom</a> up last week. With the ultra-supple <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/formula-belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">Formula Belva</a> enduro fork and new lightweight <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">DT XMC</a> carbon wheels, it creates a pedal-able super-all-mountain bike, which will serve as a test bed for everything from aggressive trail to full-on enduro components. (<em>Don’t worry, it only looks like a DH bike, but is actually a 16.5kg/36lb shredder.</em>) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s already featured a first look at the newly available <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-trickstuff-maxima-mtb-brakes-now-available-in-black-and-now-actually-available/\" target=\"_blank\">Trickstuff Maxima Black</a> brakes. And at the opposite end of the cost spectrum, first impressions are pretty solid on this worry-free <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/microshift-advent-x-10-speed-drivetrain-offers-11-48t-range-thats-lighter-than-xt/\" target=\"_blank\">MicroShift Advent X</a> drivetrain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can’t imagine a more ideal all-rounder tire than these new Schwalbe Albert Radials. My only real tough decision was whether to pick the tougher Gravity Pro casing or save 200g per tire with the Trail Pro version.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, Jested enduro racing DH\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Jested-downhill-with-view-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, I’ll stick with Gravity on this bigger bike, and keep Trail tires on the shorter travel trail bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like I found my new favorite mountain bike tire!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To find out even more, check out the core tech details, available models, and pricing in my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-radial-trail-and-gravity-mountain-bike-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe Radial mountain bike tires launch story, here</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.schwalbe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-schwalbe-albert-gravity-trail-radial-mtb-tires-simply-grip-more/\">Review: Schwalbe Albert Gravity &amp; Trail Radial MTB Tires Simply Grip More</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e501cb7a2ea453ce583dcc80f65e3220ddc2f3ebe7d219b9d050da9e1d9adb01","category":"Cycling"}
