Apparently, Apple was in such a rush to issue the update (hence the “Rapid”) that it didn’t want to wait for iOS 16.5 and macOS 13.4, which landed just two weeks later. At the time, it didn’t divulge what was fixed, but now we know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the security notes for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1674501/ios-16-5-features-sports-news-siri-install.html\">iOS 16.5</a>, iPadOS 16.5, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1674563/macos-ventura-13-4-features-sports-feed-install.html\">macOS Ventura 13.4</a> updates released on Thursday include the details on the fixes in the Rapid Security Response update.

This feature is used when Apple need to issue urgent updates to protect the security of iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and it won’t include items that are in typical OS updates, such as new features or bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A device must be running the latest version of its OS for Rapid Security Responses to work. Automatic installation is turn on by default, and Rapid Security Response updates are labeled with a letter at the end of the version number. For example, the first iOS update is iOS 16.4.1 (a).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To turn on/off Rapid Security Responses:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>iPhone/ iPad: Go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> &gt; <em>Automatic Updates</em>.
