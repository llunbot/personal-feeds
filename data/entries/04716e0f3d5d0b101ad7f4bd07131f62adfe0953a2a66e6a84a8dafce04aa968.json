It then marches through an extended beta-testing period before being released in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some of the key features of iOS are often planned to be introduced in subsequent updates. With <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18,</a> the key <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence feature</a> didn’t arrive until <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-features-fixes-security-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1</a>, with additional AI features in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-ipados-18-2-features-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-security-release.html\">iOS 18.2</a>, with even more coming in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">iOS 18.4</a>—nearly half a year after the initial iOS 18 rollout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple hasn’t yet announced iOS 19, it has been hard at work on the big iPhone upgrade for quite a while and some rumors have started to leak out, and it’s starting to look like iOS 18 is somewhat of a preview of how iOS 19 will go. Based on the most reliable leaks and rumors, here’s what you can expect when it arrives later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 19: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple typically released the latest version of iOS to the public on the Monday following the iPhone launch event. Here are the release dates for the most recent versions of iOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iOS 18:</strong> Monday, September 16, 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iOS 17:</strong> Monday, September 18, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iOS 16:</strong> Monday, September 12, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iOS 15:</strong> Monday, September 20, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on recent history, we expect iOS 19 to release to the public on either Monday, September 15, or Monday, September 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 19: Beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year, the new iOS is announced at WWDC with a beta test for developers released immediately (or at most, a day later). It often takes 4-6 weeks for the first public beta to be released, coinciding with the second or third build for developers. Apple releases the developer beta immediately after the WWDC keynote, which is expected to be on Monday, June 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18: Monday, June 10, 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 17: Monday, June 5, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 16: Monday, June 6, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 15: Monday, June 7, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows is a string of beta releases, typically eight or so in total, before the software releases in September. We expect the same schedule this year with iOS 19. You can get ready for the beta by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">signing up for the iOS beta program now</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 19: Compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect iOS 19 to be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">compatible with every iPhone that supports iOS 18</a>. That includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16 Plus</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15 Plus</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14 Plus</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13 mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12 mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 11</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 11 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 11 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XS</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XS Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XR</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone SE (2nd generation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it will also support the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 models</a> that will launch around the same time, and the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a> (which may be called the iPhone 16E).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, some features won’t be available on older models, as they lack the hardware resources for it. We do think the Apple Intelligence and Siri improvements will be available for all iPhone 16 and later models, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 19: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Apple Intelligence with an LLM Siri</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant rumored change in iOS 19 so far is what some are calling an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2529077/apple-is-working-on-a-huge-siri-upgrade-for-ios-19-and-macos-16.html\">LLM (large language model) update” to Siri</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to make Siri truly conversational, much like the advanced voice mode on ChatGPT is today, but with the added advantage of having access to all the on-device data and history for your iPhone and Apple services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would be combined with a further expansion of App Intents, which are hooks for developers to allow Siri to interact with and perform actions within their apps. These App Intents are getting a huge boost in iOS 18.4 to go along with Siri’s “personal context” update, and iOS 19 is said to expand the concept even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One caveat: This next big evolution for Siri isn’t expected to land until 2026, as part of an update to iOS 19. In other words, just as iOS 18.4 is “the big Siri update” for iOS 18, we can expect iOS 19.4 (or something like it) to be “the big Siri update” for iOS 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Home app upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While not specifically mentioned in any of the current leaks or rumors, we find it hard to believe that Apple <em>won’t</em> have some significant improvements to the Home app, HomeKit, and related services in iOS 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Well, Apple is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2562280/apples-home-strategy-for-2025-and-what-it-means-for-the-homepod.html\">release a wave of new smart home products</a> throughout 2025 and 2026. A new smart home hub is first: it’s an affordable 7-inch tablet that runs its own custom operating system (code-named Pebble) that has an interface similar to StandBy on iPhone. It will support Apple Intelligence, FaceTime, and tie in with other Apple services but isn’t expected to have an App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, likely in 2026, Apple is said to be working on a new indoor smart security camera and a smart doorbell that would use Face ID to unlock your door the way it unlocks your phone.  Further down the road, a smart home product with a movable screen on a robotic arm has been rumored, all of which will require deep integration with the iPhone and Home app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to imagine Apple pushing into first-party smart home products this much without updating the somewhat aging and clunky Home interface or introducing new features to it.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"04716e0f3d5d0b101ad7f4bd07131f62adfe0953a2a66e6a84a8dafce04aa968","category":"Apple"}
