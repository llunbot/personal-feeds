After Bonta clarified the statute, approximately half of these agencies told EFF that they updated their practices to fall in line with Bonta's reading of the law. Some states could not verify that the practice had ended yet, though.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002077#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002077&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8bc437034e8c6cc54e26d90ff7336e7b9b26041f3787d3a2225700e296bb6896","category":"Tech"}
