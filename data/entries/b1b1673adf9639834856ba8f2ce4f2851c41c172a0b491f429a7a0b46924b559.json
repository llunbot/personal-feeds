We expected the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">iOS 18 beta</a> to continue through the summer until its release in September, followed immediately by the iOS 18.1 beta. Then, iOS 18.1 would be released in October, and 18.2 beta testing would begin, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year is very different. More than a month ahead of the expected iOS 18 release, Apple began an iOS 18.1 beta test. It was made available for developers on July 29, but only for devices that are compatible with Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 16-series and M-series iPads – M-series Macs get the equivalent version of Seqioia). It’s not yet known if or when it will be available to public beta testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about the new iPhone update in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18 superguide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated September 23:</strong> The fifth beta of iOS 18.1 is out now, and it adds a few welcome but minor changes, detailed below.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.1: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s biggest iOS 18 feature is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>, a suite of AI tools and Siri enhancements that will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as later iPhones. Apple Intelligence is coming to Macs with Apple Silicon as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence features are coming in sort of a phased rollout: some features were intended to be available with the launch of iOS 18, some later in 2024, and some in an update in the spring of 2025. Apple’s plans have changed a bit, with the first wave of Apple Intelligence features coming in iOS 18.1, which will probably arrive in October. We have a guide to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">which features are coming at what time</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following features are available in the initial iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 beta test:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AI writing tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New and improved Siri</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mail features like smart replies and email summaries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Natural language in photos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Call recording and transcription</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Safari web page summaries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean Up tool in Photos</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The following AI features are not in the iOS 18.1 beta:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>ChatGPT integration</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Image Playground</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Genmoji</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Advanced Siri features like on-screen awareness, personal context, and actions within apps</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The image features were said to arrive at launch, but more recent reports say it will come later this year in iOS 18.2 or 18.3. ChatGPT integration should arrive around that time, too. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">advanced Siri stuff is coming in early 2025</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 2 added the iOS 18 changes that came in iOS 18 beta 5. Namely, some improvements to the new Photos app interface and Safari’s “Hide Distracting Items” feature. There are new splash screens throughout iOS to describe new features in various apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 3 added the “Clean Up” tool in Photos, but none of the other generative AI image capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 4 added support for older iPhone models. The call recording and transcription feature appears to work on earlier iPhone models, rather than only on those that support Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models). It also adds a dedicated camera mode for Spatial Photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 5 expands <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2385455/rcs-iphone-ios-18-faq.html\">RCS</a> to a few additional carriers, adds drag-and-drop support when using iPhone Mirroring on a Mac, and new Control Center controls (including individual Wi-Fi and VPN toggles).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.1: Requirements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS 18.1 beta is currently locked behind a waitlist. When it was first released, users who download the iOS 18.1 developer beta were greeted with the following message:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>iOS 18.1 beta is an early preview of an update to iOS 18 that will be available later this fall. This beta introduces an initial set of features powered by Apple Intelligence.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To try the Apple Intelligence beta, join the waitlist in Settings and you will be notified as soon as it is ready for your device. Both device language and Siri language must be set to US English, and device region must be set to United States.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As noted, Apple Intelligence is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max in U.S. English, and of course on iPhone 16 models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the Digital Markets Act, Apple Intelligence is blocked in the EU, but version 2 of the beta made a workaround possible to access the features in that region (Apple Intelligence is available on Macs in the EU). Apple Intelligence is also blocked in China.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.1: How to install the iOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS 18.1 beta is currently only available for developers, but anyone can get it. Beginning with iOS 17, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered developers can choose to get the iOS 18.1 beta instead by going to the Settings app, then <em>General &gt; Software Update,</em> and selecting <em>iOS Developer Beta</em> in the Beta Updates tab. When you return to the main Software Update screen, you’ll Upgrade to iOS 18 at the bottom of the screen under the Also Available heading. Tap that and it’ll take you to the iOS 18.1 beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, remember to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">back up your iPhone</a> before you install the beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to run the public beta, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Head to <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/\">beta.apple.com</a> and register your Apple ID for the beta.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> &gt; <em>Beta Updates</em> and select the beta you wish to install.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the beta.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b1b1673adf9639834856ba8f2ce4f2851c41c172a0b491f429a7a0b46924b559","category":"Apple"}
