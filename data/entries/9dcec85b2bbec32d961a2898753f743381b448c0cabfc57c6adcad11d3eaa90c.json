The expansion of link card previews to more types of content, and to links pasted directly in the Messages app, is a nice improvement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first developer beta of iOS 18 is available now, and a public beta will follow in July. The update should be widely released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/\">Messages</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-imessage-link-card-previews/\">iMessage on iOS 18 Previews Link Cards for Social Media Posts and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imessage-on-ios-18-previews-link-cards-for-social-media-posts-and-more.2428824/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9dcec85b2bbec32d961a2898753f743381b448c0cabfc57c6adcad11d3eaa90c","category":"Apple"}
