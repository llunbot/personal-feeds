The mapping app was forced to merge with Google Geo (aka the Google Maps division) even though the two apps supposedly remain mostly independent. Six months later, CNBC's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/google-cuts-jobs-at-waze-as-it-continues-to-merge-mapping-products.html\">Jennifer Elias</a> reports the job cuts have arrived, and Waze will be losing some employees.</p>\n<p>Google Geo's VP and general manager, Chris Phillips, announced that Waze's ad platform would be shut down in favor of Google ads and reportedly told employees that the move \"will result in a reduction of Waze Ads monetization-focused roles in sales, marketing, operations, and analytics.\" It's not clear how many of Waze's 500 employees will be affected. Google has been doing all sorts of layoffs lately, with the biggest batch—12,000 jobs—announced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-cuts-12000-jobs-the-largest-layoff-in-the-companys-history/\">in January</a>.</p>\n<p>If there's anything Google is good at, it's advertising, so it certainly makes sense for Waze to adopt Google's ad platform. Waze has a lot of redundancy compared to Google Maps, and it's unclear how far Google wants to take this logic. Right now, the company maintains two separate mapping apps with similar features and similar layouts. Waze has 140 million monthly active users, but that's not much compared to the billion-plus users of Google Maps. You could certainly argue for a full-blown merger, but Google told CNBC it \"remains deeply committed to growing Waze’s unique brand, its beloved app and its thriving community of volunteers and users,\" which should calm the fears of Waze users a bit. Remember, though, mergers and shutdowns come at you fast at Google, like when the company most recently said Stadia \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia/status/1552989433590214656?s=20&amp;t=xVzXMW9DJZI57ZMwnGDF7w\">is not shutting down</a>\" two months before announcing Stadia <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/\">would be shut down</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950684#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950684&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9021199a198b9c2014ca44856a8937107c4a8e4e8c8718a129562e3a7012c5f4","category":"Tech"}
