Because\nof vascular involvement, surgery is not possible. I am taking\nweekly chemo treatments to shrink the tumor before surgical\nresection. I am tolerating the chemo pretty well, and I am in good\nspirits. Every day I make a point of getting out in the sun and\nwalking with Cai and Poppy. [...]</p>\n\n<p>At 73 years, I have already lived an amazing and wonderful life. I\nhave loved and been loved, beginning with my remarkable mother who\nbelieved in me. With my work at Apple and General Magic I am\ngrateful that I could make positive contributions to the lives of\nmany millions of people, and even affect the course of human\nevolution.</p>\n\n<p>But I want more quality time to share life and experiences with\nCai and with my friends and family. My bucket list is not filled\nwith places to travel, but instead with quality time with those I\nlove and those who love me.</p>\n\n<p>I am living my life filled with gratitude. Each day is a special\ngift to be unwrapped, enjoyed, and cherished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A seminal figure in the history of Apple, <a href=\"https://www.folklore.org/Busy_Being_Born.html\">and the Macintosh in particular</a>. I’ve not yet had the pleasure of meeting him, but by all accounts I’ve heard from numerous of his former colleagues, in addition to being a genius programmer, he’s a kind and generous person.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/13/atkinson-prayers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b7e869a0324ed3b7d46f0301c3149702d47389f1d79196ec67256e2e9b553969","category":"Tech"}
