It is set to be introduced alongside new Apple Watch models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/apple-roadmap-2023-24-15-new-devices/\">this year</a>. Kosutami told <em>MacRumors</em> that the band is likely designed for the ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌, rather than the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>.
