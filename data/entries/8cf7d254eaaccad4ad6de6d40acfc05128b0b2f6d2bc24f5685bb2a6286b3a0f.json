Twenty years ago this small city was selected as the start location of the newly minted women’s edition of the race, and since 2012 it has also hosted the finish of both the men’s and women’s events. Little wonder that it is here, nestled in a corner just off the grand marketplace, that you will find the cycling hub and museum that is the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It all started with a book,’ Bo Decramer, one of the founders, tells <em>Cyclist</em> as we walk around the centre. Around 35 years ago, Decramer, who worked in PR, wrote a book on the Tour of Flanders along with Rik Vanwalleghem, a well-known journalist and author.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was a coffee table book about the history of the race: the atmosphere, the heroes, the routes, the landscapes,’ Decramer says. ‘It was the very first book with that level of detail.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With another colleague, Geert Vandenbon, on board as publisher, the book came out in 1990 in time to mark the 75th edition of the race the following year. It was well received and won the Kredietbank Sports Book Award, after which Decramer and his colleagues decided they wanted to construct something in recognition of the importance of the Tour of Flanders to the area.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>‘A few years later the provincial government of East Flanders decided they wanted to make this area known as a province of cycling. They wanted to increase tourism,’ Decramer says. ‘They asked if we had any ideas on doing something permanent about the Tour of Flanders. And so it started. We went everywhere here in the Flemish Ardennes to look at what we could do.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They visited cities, towns and villages across the area, where buildings would be presented by local authorities as possible locations – often old houses and farm buildings that would require extensive renovation work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But we didn’t want just a museum,’ Decramer says. ‘We wanted an experience alongside a museum, a place where you could hire bikes, change and take showers, with a shop and a cafe. We wanted a vibrant place dedicated to cycling in the area, not a dusty museum in a small, old house.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually it was decided to construct a new building, regenerating an area in the southwest corner of Oudenaarde’s marketplace. In 2003 the Centrum de Ronde van Vlaanderen opened its doors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>One race, many stories</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02-728x970.webp\" alt=\"Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02-1140x1520.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Kevin Faingnaert</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When <em>Cyclist</em> visits, the centre’s temporary exhibition space has been dedicated to the SD Worx team – formerly Boels-Dolmans. ‘It is very important that we have more attention for women’s cycling and this is the top team,’ says Decramer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After admiring a rainbow jersey signed by Lotte Kopecky and the collection of bikes and memorabilia showcasing SD Worx, we move on through the museum’s permanent exhibition. Here is assembled a wide-ranging collection, from bikes and jerseys through to trophies and bidons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are exhibits detailing how the media covers the race and the importance of the event to Flemish people. Highlights include a replica Peugeot 404 Flandria team car, a 1958 Groene Leeuw bike ridden by Arthur Decabooter (who won the 1960 race) and a large ‘vase of honour’ in Delft blue and featuring the Lion of Flanders that was given to two-time winner Alberic ‘Briek’ Schotte in celebration of his record 20 appearances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An interactive exhibit with a virtual reality headset allows visitors to follow in the pedal strokes of Paul Deman, the first winner of the race in 1913, who was later captured by German soldiers when using his bike to smuggle documents into the Netherlands during the First World War. Happily he survived, and won Paris-Roubaix in 1920.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Every time I come to the centre I feel proud. It’s incredible what we’ve made of it,’ Decramer said in 2023 for an article celebrating the centre’s 20th anniversary. It’s easy to see why: by late afternoon the exhibition areas are quiet, but cyclists are still arriving. There are people browsing the shop while others are sat in the cafe, discussing their rides over drinks and snacks. I overhear a cyclist talking with staff in English about a local route as mechanics wheel by recently serviced bikes, labelled and ready for collection by customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a real buzz of activity about the place, exactly the sort of vibrant space that Decramer and his colleagues envisaged more than two decades ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For more details on the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen visit <a href=\"https://www.crvv.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">crvv.be</a>.

Sunweb’s Ellen van Dijk initially led the chasing group of ten but Van der Breggen quickly gained a 25-second lead and disappeared into the distance. The chasing group, which featured many of the strongest riders in women’s racing at the time, slowed, letting the peloton come back to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 20km to go, the gap had grown to nearly a minute. Van der Breggen powered up the two final climbs – the Oude Kwaremont and the Paterberg with its 20% maximum gradient – to claim victory by 1min 8sec, adding the Ronde to the Strade Bianche win she had taken four weeks earlier.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04-728x970.webp\" alt=\"Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04-1140x1520.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Kevin Faingnaert</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Van der Breggen would go on to win Flèche Wallonne, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and the World Championships in what was an incredible season for the 28-year-old Dutchwoman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the bike that Van der Breggen rode into Oudenaarde that day. The 2018 Specialized S-Works Tarmac frame was customised with flashes of gold. This is a nod to Van der Breggen being the reigning Olympic champion at the time of her race-winning Flanders ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

It is a variant of the jersey the team’s riders more commonly wore that year, including Britain’s Tom Simpson, who was in his second season as a professional and about to burst onto the scene courtesy of a daring ride in the 1960 Paris-Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures from that race show Simpson wearing a long-sleeved Rapha-Gitane jersey with a similar design but different colouring than the one here, as he broke away from the peloton with some 45km to the finish. It was his first appearance at Paris-Roubaix but he held the lead until Pino Cerami and Tino Sabbadini, who would finish first and second respectively, caught him with around 5km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end Simpson finished ninth but he had captured the attention of the cycling press, with Jean Bobet writing that Simpson had demonstrated both ‘fight and ambition’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twelve months later Simpson made his debut in the Tour of Flanders, and the race went down in history. With around 55km to go he bridged across to a small breakaway group alongside Italy’s Nino Defilippis. Simpson and the Italian then went away on the finishing circuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong wind had blown down the finish banner, and while Defilippis sprinted for the first white line on the road Simpson crossed the actual line ahead to become the first and, to date, only British winner of the men’s race.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-cycling-koers-museum-flanders\">A history of cycling in 6 objects at the Koers Museum, Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-cobbled-climbs-flanders\">The best cobbled climbs in Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2025: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>3.

Of the 108 editions held to date, 69 have been won by home riders. Although that dominance is front-loaded – of the first 35 races only Heiri Suter of Switzerland and Italy’s Fiorenzo Magni broke the host nation’s stranglehold, with Suter claiming the 1923 edition and Magni winning three editions in a row between 1949 and 1951 – Belgium has remained the pre-eminent force in the race’s long history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next best performing country is the Netherlands with 13 wins, while Italy has 11 and Switzerland five. Three of those Swiss wins come courtesy of Fabian Cancellara, who used to come to the centre to shower and eat after his recon ride, something that was never announced to avoid crowds. French riders have claimed just three editions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the nations with a single win in the men’s edition is Norway. That came in 2015 when Alexander Kristoff of Katusha followed the attack of Etixx-QuickStep’s Dutch rider Niki Terpstra with 28km to the finish. In the build-up to the race Kristoff had dominated the Three Days of De Panne, claiming three of the four stages and becoming the first Norwegian to win the overall. Now, aiming for the biggest win of his career, he worked with Terpstra to stay away before taking the sprint in relatively straightforward fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is the bike Alexander Kristoff rode to his win in 2015,’ Decramer says of the Canyon Aeroad CF SLX the Norwegian used that day. ‘You can see the symbology of Norway on it,’ he continues, referring to the colours of the Norwegian flag on the frame and the image of an axe-wielding Viking on Kristoff’s Selle Italia saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three days later Kristoff continued his run of form by winning Scheldeprijs, once more getting Norway onto a race’s winner’s list for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven days, three races, three firsts for Norway. Quite a week of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

This was the year that the Koppenberg was introduced, a move that was controversial given its poor cobblestoned surface and gradients of more than 20%. Before the race, Freddy Maertens said that ‘no one will cross this hill by bike. We will all dismount and the race will be blocked.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it turned out, Maertens was one of the first over the top after his teammate, Marc Demeyer, attacked on the climb and forced a final selection of five riders, with Francesco Moser, Roger de Vlaeminck, Maertens and Planckaert joining Demeyer for the race’s finale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planckaert, who possessed a terrific sprint, did little to contribute to the break. Maertens and De Vlaeminck, in the midst of a bitter rivalry, watched each other and allowed the other three a gap. Demeyer looked back and gestured to Maertens to come across, only for his Flandria teammate to remain where he was. The resultant three-man sprint was won by Planckaert, who threw an arm up in celebration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The mayor of Ninove, where the finish was, had VIPs in his house,’ Decramer says. ‘He had 30 or 40 people in his home after the race and Walter came for some champagne. The mayor wanted to give him something and so he took this vase from his home and gave it to Walter. It doesn’t have any other relation to the race. The mayor just wanted to give the race winner something.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

Replacing the Road World Cup, the inaugural season would comprise 17 events, running from Strade Bianche through to the Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta. One-day Classics such as Flèche Wallonne and the Tour of Flanders would feature alongside stage races such as the Giro d’Italia Internazionale Femminile. There was even a team time-trial event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of a top-level series of races under the same UCI WorldTour branding as the existing men’s series was hailed as an important step in women’s cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inaugural series was dominated by the Boels-Dolmans team. First Lizzie Deignan (then Armitstead) won Strade Bianche in imperious fashion, riding strongly on the Santa Caterina climb to the finish in the Piazza del Campo ahead of breakaway companions Kasia Niewiadoma and Emma Johansson. Teammate Chantal van den Broek-Blaak won the next event, the Ronde van Drenthe. Deignan then took the Trofeo Binda, before Van den Broek-Blaak returned to the top of the podium at Gent-Wevelgem with Deignan taking the Tour of Flanders a week later. Five WWT races and five wins for Boels-Dolmans. And it was still only the first week of April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No surprise then that come the end of the season the very first WWT team trophy, pictured here, was won by Boels-Dolmans, whose riders had won ten of the 17 events, including that team time-trial in Sweden. American Megan Guarnier, another Boels-Dolmans rider, won three races including the Giro to claim the individual title.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

This is Belgium’s greatest sporting event, one that is engrained in the fabric of Flemish life. With that comes enormous pressure for the home riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Belgian professional and sports director José De Cauwer told <em>Cyclist</em> in 2018 that this was the race ‘where I lost the most sleep beforehand. I could do anything, have a few drinks, take a sleeping pill, but I always woke up at 4am.’ So just imagine what it must feel like to be a home favourite, the defending champion and be wearing the rainbow jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is exactly what Tom Boonen faced in 2006. Boonen was still in the first half of an already stellar career and had claimed the Flanders/Roubaix double and the World Championships in 2005. He went into the 2006 edition of the race as favourite, so when Discovery Channel’s Leif Hoste launched a move with 33km to go it was no surprise to see Boonen, wearing that rainbow jersey, jump straight onto Hoste’s wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two built a race-winning lead before the inevitable game of cat-and-mouse began in the final kilometre. Boonen was forced to the front as the pace dramatically slowed but Hoste’s attempt to get a jump on his compatriot with just over 300m to go proved fruitless. Boonen easily regained Hoste’s wheel before sprinting past to successfully defend his title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is his jersey,’ Decramer says as we look at the rainbow bands Boonen wore that day. ‘You can see it hasn’t been washed and you have the number one on the back.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jersey is on loan from Boonen and has been part of the museum’s collection for a couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I went to his parents to collect it the evening before the coronavirus closed things here in Belgium for the first time,’ Decramer says, explaining that riders and families are often happy to lend the museum memorabilia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We signed an agreement and assurances for the loan. We don’t want to own the collection; our task is not to collect items forever, but often families will say we can keep things for as long as we like.’   </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/centrum-ronde-van-vlaanderen\">Tour of Flanders history in 6 items at the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8cf7d254eaaccad4ad6de6d40acfc05128b0b2f6d2bc24f5685bb2a6286b3a0f","category":"Cycling"}
