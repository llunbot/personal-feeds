That lets J.Laverack offer full custom geometry, or stick to the stock geometry of their broad standard frame sizes (44-64cm). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset.jpg\" alt=\"J.Laverack AM64 3D-printed lugs of titanium bikes, GRiT AM64 frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_Grit-gravel-bike-frameset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The AM64 tech is now offered on all of J.Laverack’s models, which encompasses road, gravel, urban commuter, and mountain bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_headtube.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_headtube.jpg\" alt=\"J.Laverack AM64 3D-printed lugs of titanium bikes, 3d-printed ti headtube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_headtube.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_headtube-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_headtube-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_headtube-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/J-Laverack-AM64-3D-printed-lugs-of-titanium-bikes_headtube-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3D-printed 6Al-4V titanium elements are seamlessly welded to the matching ti tubes for the most part.
