But the Paint app as it stands in Windows 10 is barely changed from the Windows 7 version of the app, and Windows 7's biggest contribution to Paint was the adoption of the \"ribbon\" user interface introduced in the then-current Office 2007.</p>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-3-980x613.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          For reference, the Windows 10 version of the Paint app (shown here in the current Windows 11 preview) looked a lot like the Windows 7 version.

But the app was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/crap-artists-rejoice-ms-paint-is-getting-a-last-minute-reprieve/\">saved from the Recycle Bin</a> a couple of years later and given an under-the-hood update that improved screen reader support and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/saved-from-obsolescence-microsoft-is-now-making-paint-better/\">added keyboard controls</a>. The new update might not signal a renewed commitment to making Paint an actual heavy-duty image editor, but it does at least suggest that Microsoft will be less willing to let the current uncomfortable mix of Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10-era apps continue to coexist in the Windows 11 era. The updated Paint app will be going out to Windows Insiders \"soon.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788394\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788394&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9ec14a866fb05dc8a425e9f585761536f97ddbdfa16c2f9d2efe715b383a93c5","category":"Tech"}
