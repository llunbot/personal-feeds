Google says the new interface will begin with Android OS, but it will eventually expand across the full Google app ecosystem, bringing a more lively vibe to Gmail, Google Photos, and more.</p>\n<p>Material 3 Expressive won't be entirely unfamiliarâ€”it shares some basic design elements with the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/android-12s-beautiful-color-changing-ui-already-lives-up-to-the-hype/\">Material You system</a> Google launched four years ago.

Google claims people can find these important buttons four times faster than they can with older Material You interfaces.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-reveals-vibrant-material-3-expressive-coming-soon-to-a-pixel-near-you/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-reveals-vibrant-material-3-expressive-coming-soon-to-a-pixel-near-you/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1165f9cbc67f7b8bb47730af8e125d62d10d3f2e5fa5f7d750743a645f881de0","category":"Tech"}
