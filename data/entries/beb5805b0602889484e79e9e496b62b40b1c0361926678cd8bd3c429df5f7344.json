{"title":"This official Apple special-edition Watch band is down to just $14","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2334722/this-official-apple-special-edition-watch-band-is-down-to-just-14.html","date":1715799354000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like Apple Watches, extra Apple Watch bands can be rather pricey, so whenever one snaps, replacing it can burn your pocket for $50. Thankfully, we found a <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/789365129&amp;subid1=1-1-2334722-1-0-0\">fantastic model on clearance at Walmart that’s just $14</a>, good for $35 off the original MSRP and a great chance to grab an official Apple Watch for less than some third-party options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discounted model is the 40mm/44mm Black Unity Sports Band. This special edition watch band was created to celebrate Black history and culture and is inspired by the Pan-African flag, featuring the same beautiful combination of black, red, and green. The band also has an inscription that reads “Truth. Power. Solidarity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are 40mm and 44mm bands, but they will fit all larger Apple Watch models. More specifically, the 40mm option will fit 38mm, 40mm, or 41mm models, and the 44mm band will fit 42mm, 44mm, 45mm, and 49mm Ultra models.  That’s every Apple Watch series so no matter which watch you have, you’re good to go with this $14 bargain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this is a sports band, it’s made of synthetic rubber that’s durable and strong but also soft and comfortable to wear for long hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, Apple’s Sports Bands are available to purchase for $49, but since this one is on clearance due to the new 2024 Black Unity band arriving this month, grabbing one for a mere $14 is an absolute steal. We advise you to hurry up and place your order because such bargains vanish quickly. </p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/789365129&amp;subid1=1-1-2334722-7-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Black Unity Apple Watch Sports Band for $14 at Walmart</a></p>\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"beb5805b0602889484e79e9e496b62b40b1c0361926678cd8bd3c429df5f7344","category":"Apple"}
