But some of its most diverse and fascinating biomes are thriving in the darkness below.</p>\n<p>We used to think that the subsurface was a far-from-ideal place for living things. Habitats that can soak up light and warmth from the Sun have the energy to sustain many forms of life and so were viewed as the most diverse. That view is now changing.</p>\n<p>Led by Emil Ruff of the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Mass., new research has unearthed communities of underground microbes that are almost as—and sometimes more—diverse than even reefs and rainforests. Ruff and his team found that subsurface bacteria and archaea are flourishing, even at depths where the energy supply is orders of magnitude lower than enjoyed by organisms in habitats that see the sun.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/life-is-thriving-in-the-subsurface-depths-of-earth/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/life-is-thriving-in-the-subsurface-depths-of-earth/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed5dad1071d5c32a508068a8f0f690aae8ff89d36f8188e55d0c6a1a3ef7563b","category":"Tech"}
