With a flash of orange light, the rocket's nine kerosene-fueled Merlin engines ignited and propelled the Falcon 9 off the launch pad at 3:27 am EDT (07:27 UTC).</p>\n<p>The rocket headed northeast from the Florida coast to arc over the Atlantic Ocean and line up with the flight path of the International Space Station. About two-and-a-half minutes into the launch, the Falcon 9's first stage booster separated from the rocket's upper stage to begin thrusting back toward Cape Canaveral. The return maneuver culminated in an on-target vertical landing a few miles south of the launch pad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963575#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963575&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b84c010077c73c838a11ea08181a11ace8618dd6a4c29bcacbdec4ba961576d9","category":"Tech"}
