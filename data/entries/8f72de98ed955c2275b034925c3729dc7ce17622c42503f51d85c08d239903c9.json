The attacks began soon after the peloton left Puerto Lumbreras, but it took almost two hours and 70 km for an 11-strong breakaway to escape. Ineos Grenadiers took over at the front of the peloton and the race settled down a little, but the reprieve was brief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The break’s advantage was back to within 90 seconds on the lower slopes of the first-category Alto Collado Venta Luisa, the longest climb of the Vuelta. Feeling the peloton breathing down his neck, Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Victorious) accelerated away from his fellow escapees halfway up the 29.2 km mountain, and no one could follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos continued to lead the group of favourites around two minutes behind Caruso – who started the day 6:47 down on GC after losing time in the crosswinds on stage 6 – until about 40 km to go when they stopped riding. With the peloton stalling, Geoffrey Bouchard (AG2R-Citroën) attacked from its flank and rode his way up to the small chasing group, where he spent the remainder of the stage stuck in no man’s land. Meanwhile, Jumbo-Visma assumed control of the peloton and let the gap stretch out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the foot of the final 13.1 km climb, Caruso’s gap was 3:18 over the chasers and 5:15 over the red jersey group. The GC battle further down the mountain swept up the chasers and cut a good chunk out of his advantage, but Caruso stayed away to take a well-earned stage win. Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) was second to cross the line a little over a minute later, with Enric Mas (Movistar) just behind in third, the only favourite who could stick with the race leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič strengthened his lead on GC after weathering the repeated attacks on the final climb, and Mas moves up to second overall. Further down the standings, Mikel Landa (Bahrain-Victorious) all but dropped out of contention, finishing 5:04 behind his teammate, but Jack Haig’s leap up to fourth overall keeps Bahrain-Victorious in the GC race. Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) also seemed to struggle in the face of repeated attacks, some of them by his teammates. Even so, he only lost 1:05 to Roglič and remains the best-placed Ineos rider going into the first rest day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n    <div>\n\t\t            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLa Vuelta ciclista a España (2.UWT)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <span>Puerto-Lumbreras → Alto de Velefique</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=256619\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                        <img />\n\t\t\t\t\t                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">CARUSO Damiano</a>\n                                            <span>Bahrain -
