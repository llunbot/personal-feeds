{"title":"Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku model is now available on Amazon Bedrock","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-haiku-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/","date":1710368865000,"content":"<p>Last week, Anthropic announced their <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family\">Claude 3 foundation model family</a>. The family includes three models: <strong>Claude 3 Haiku</strong>, the fastest and most compact model for near-instant responsiveness; <strong>Claude 3 Sonnet</strong>, the ideal balanced model between skills and speed; and <strong>Claude 3 Opus</strong>, the most intelligent offering for top-level performance on highly complex tasks. AWS also announced the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-sonnet-foundation-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/\">general availability of Claude 3 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock</a>.</p> \n<p>Today, we are announcing the availability of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude\"><strong>Claude 3 Haiku on Amazon Bedrock</strong></a>. The Claude 3 Haiku foundation model is the fastest and most compact model of the Claude 3 family, designed for near-instant responsiveness and seamless generative artificial intelligence (AI) experiences that mimic human interactions. For example, it can read a data-dense research paper on arXiv (~10k tokens) with charts and graphs in less than three seconds.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/03/11/4baa611f-4c73-4a19-914c-ba1966eb6703.gif\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1138\" /></p> \n<p>With Claude 3 Haiku’s availability on Amazon Bedrock, you can build near-instant responsive generative AI applications for enterprises that need quick and accurate targeted performance. Like Sonnet and Opus, Haiku has image-to-text vision capabilities, can understand multiple languages besides English, and boasts increased steerability in a 200k context window.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Claude 3 Haiku use cases</u></strong><br /> Claude 3 Haiku is smarter, faster, and more affordable than other models in its intelligence category. It answers simple queries and requests with unmatched speed. With its fast speed and increased steerability, you can create AI experiences that seamlessly imitate human interactions.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/03/10/2023-claude3-haiku-bedrock-0-models.png\" width=\"1612\" height=\"1099\" />Here are some use cases for using Claude 3 Haiku:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Customer interactions: quick and accurate support in live interactions, translations</li> \n <li>Content moderation: catch risky behavior or customer requests</li> \n <li>Cost-saving tasks: optimized logistics, inventory management, fast knowledge extraction from unstructured data</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To learn more about Claude 3 Haiku’s features and capabilities, visit <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\">Anthropic’s Claude on Amazon Bedrock</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-claude.html\">Anthropic Claude models</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Claude 3 Haiku in action</u></strong><br /> If you are new to using Anthropic models, go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock console</a> and choose <strong>Model access </strong>on the bottom left pane.
