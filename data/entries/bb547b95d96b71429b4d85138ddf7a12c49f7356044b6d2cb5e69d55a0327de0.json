It has equipped them with new abilities to retire technical debt, modernize legacy systems, and build agile infrastructure to help unlock the value that is trapped in their internal data. However, many enterprises still rely heavily on legacy IT infrastructure, particularly mainframes and VMware-based systems. These platforms have been the backbone of critical operations for decades, but they hinder organizations’ ability to innovate, scale effectively, and reduce technical debt in an era where cloud-first strategies dominate. The need to modernize these workloads is clear, but the journey has traditionally been complex and risky.</p> \n<p>The complexity spans multiple dimensions. Financially, organizations face mounting licensing costs and expensive migration projects. Technically, they must untangle legacy dependencies while meeting compliance requirements. Organizationally, they must manage the transition of teams who’ve built careers around legacy systems and navigate undocumented institutional knowledge.</p> \n<p>AWS Transform directly addresses these challenges with purpose-built agentic AI that accelerates and de-risks your legacy modernization. It automates the assessment, planning, and transformation of both mainframe and VMware workloads into cloud based architectures, streamlining the entire process. Through intelligent insights, automated code transformation, and human-in-the-loop workflows, organizations can now tackle even the most challenging modernization projects with greater confidence and efficiency.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Mainframe workload migration<br /> </strong></span>AWS Transform for mainframe is the first agentic AI service for modernizing mainframe workloads at scale. The specialized mainframe agent accelerates mainframe modernization by automating complex, resource-intensive tasks across every phase of modernization — from initial assessment to final deployment. It streamlines the migration of legacy applications built on IBM z/OS, including COBOL, CICS, DB2, and VSAM, to modern cloud environments–cutting modernization timelines from years to months.</p> \n<p>Let’s look at a few examples of how AWS Transform can help you through different aspects of the migration process.</p> \n<p><strong>Code analysis</strong> – AWS Transform provides comprehensive insights into your codebase, automatically examining mainframe codebases, creating detailed dependency graphs, measuring code complexity, and identifying component relationships</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/14/mainframe-code-analysis-v2.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/14/mainframe-code-analysis-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"938\" height=\"404\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>Documentation</strong> – AWS Transform for mainframe creates comprehensive technical and functional documentation of mainframe applications, preserving critical knowledge about features, program logic, and data flows.

This is aggravated by the fact that the accumulation of technical debt typically creates complex, poorly documented environments managed by multiple teams, leading to vendor lock-in and collaboration challenges that hinder migration efforts further.</p> \n<p>AWS Transform is the first agentic AI service for VMware modernization of its kind that helps you to overcome those difficulties. It can offset risk and accelerate the modernization of VMware workloads by automating application discovery, dependency mapping, migration planning, network conversion, and EC2 instance optimization, reducing manual effort and accelerating cloud adoption.</p> \n<p>The process is organized into four phases: inventory discovery, wave planning, network conversion, and server migration. It uses agentic AI capabilities to analyze and map complex VMware environments, converting network configurations into AWS built-in constructs and helps you to orchestrate dependency-aware migration waves for seamless cutovers. In addition, it also provides a collaborative web interface that keeps AWS teams, partners, and customers aligned throughout the modernization journey.</p> \n<p>Let’s take a quick tour to see how this works.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Setting up<br /> </strong></span>Before you can start using the service, you must first enable it by navigating to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/transform/home\">AWS Transform console</a>. AWS Transform requires <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/\">AWS IAM Identity Center (IdC)</a> to manage users and setup appropriate permissions. If you don’t yet have IdC set up it will ask you to configure it first and return to the AWS Transform console later to continue the process.</p> \n<p>With IdC available, you can then proceed to choosing the encryption settings. AWS Transform gives you the option to use a default AWS managed key or you can use your own custom keys through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kms/\">AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/aws-transform-setup-encryption-setting-cropped.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/aws-transform-setup-encryption-setting-cropped.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1257\" height=\"347\" /></a></p> \n<p>After completing this step, AWS Transform will be enabled. You can manage admin access to the console by navigating to <strong>Users</strong> and using the search box to find them. You must create users or groups in IdC first if they don’t already exist. The service console will help admins provision users who will get access to the web app. Each provisioned user receives an email with a link to set password and get their personalized URL for the webapp.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/aws-transform-adding-users-or-groups.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/aws-transform-adding-users-or-groups.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1800\" /></a></p> \n<p>You interact with AWS Transform through a dedicated web experience. To get the url, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> where you can check your configurations and copy the links to the AWS Transform web experience where you and your teams can start using the service.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/aws-transform-setting-cropped.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/13/aws-transform-setting-cropped.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2822\" height=\"586\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Discovery<br /> </strong></span>AWS Transform can discover your VMware environment either automatically through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/\">AWS Application Discovery Service</a> collectors or you can provide your own data by importing existing RVTools export files.<span><strong><br /> </strong></span></p> \n<p>To get started, choose the <strong>Create or select connectors</strong> task and provide the account IDs for one or more AWS accounts that will be used for discovery. This will generate links that you can follow to authorize each account for usage within AWS Transform. You can then move on to the <strong>Perform discovery </strong>task, where you can choose to install <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/\">AWS Application Discovery Service</a> collectors or upload your own files such as exports from RVTools.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/14/vmware-discovery-summary.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/14/vmware-discovery-summary.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2077\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Provisioning<br /> </strong></span>The steps for the provisioning phase are similar to the ones described earlier for discovery. You connect target AWS accounts by entering their account IDs and validating the authorization requests which will then enable the next steps such as the <strong>Generate VPC configuration</strong> step. Here, you can import your RVTools files or NSX exports from <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/import-export-for-nsx\">Import/Export from NSX</a>, if applicable, and enable AWS Transform to understand your networking requirements.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/14/network-configuration-vmware.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/14/network-configuration-vmware.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3800\" height=\"1984\" /></a></p> \n<p>You should then continue working through the job plan until you reach the point where it’s ready to deploy your <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/\">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</a>.
