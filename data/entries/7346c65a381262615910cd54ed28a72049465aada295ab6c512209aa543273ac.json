Once a song has been identified, djay instantly loads it onto the virtual decks and plays the audio in sync with the external music source. The app's Automix feature can then create a mix with similar tracks. djay also saves previously identified songs to users' Shazam history in Control Center on iOS 15.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"Integrating Shazam into djay completely transforms the creative workflow of DJs,\" said Algoriddim CEO Karim Morsy. \"As a DJ you are constantly on the lookout for great new music to play at your next gig, but identifying a track and the process of getting it into your library has been a challenging task with no seamless way to do it. Now, whenever you hear a great song you can load it into djay's decks with the tap of a button.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple announced ShazamKit alongside iOS 15, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/19/when-is-ios-15-public-release/\">will be released later today</a>.
