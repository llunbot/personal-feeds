I have quested for ages to find an inflatable pillow that didn’t leave a kink in my neck every morning at camp. I needed a very thick pillow to keep my shoulder and neck from scrunching in. The distance from my shoulder to neck is about 6″, which makes it almost impossible to find pillows that tall (even the non-camping kind). I also toss around in my sleep, and my pillows would always slide off inflatable and non-inflatable pads alike. I needed a solution to keep my pillow from moving all over when I turned over during the night.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I used to sleep so soundly on just a stuff sack of my spare layers, until I started to find I was only packing some layers so I have something to use as a pillow. Possibly more useful to have layers than a pillow if something went awry, though it did start to become nonsensical. I started to carry a proper camp pillow eventually, but ran into the aforementioned issues of sliding and being too thin. Most camp pillows are at most 4″ thick, which is still thinner than I’d like, ideally.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Original Flextail Zero</h3>\n<p>I snagged the original version of the Flextail Zero pillow (non-thicc version) on the basis that it was 4″ thick, the same as my pillow at the time, and it had a small snap-on strap. That strap was crucial to keep the pillow from moving around. When I first tried the Zero pillow with my preferred Thermarest Ridgerest (I’ll do a Zrest vs Ridgerest rant someday), and was able to make two small slits for the strap pass through the pad. This allowed me to secure the pillow to my pad, which made for less rearranging mid-sleep.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Loss Provides an Opportunity</h3>\n<p>I lost my original Zero pillow a while ago, and when I went to replace it, there was now a “thick” version, to my delight. Adding an inch of height and some padding sounded great to my ears. There is a bit more weight added, but at this point, I’m not putting a few ounces before a good night’s rest. I immediately snagged a replacement. Some sock elf ran off with my old pillow just so I could find a better version!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-8.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-8.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Flextail_Zero_Pillow_Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Custom Sleep System Complete</h3>\n<p>With my Ridgerest “customized” to fit the Zero Pillow, I have nearly created my dream sleep setup. I use a large and long Ridgerest which, while not easy to carry on a bike, provides me plenty of room to stretch or curl up throughout the night. I also love that I never need to worry about popping my foam pad in the desert. The Zero pillow doesn’t budge throughout all my rolling around during the night. I wish I could find an inflatable pad that I slept better on, if only for simple packability, but I haven’t found it yet.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to sleep on your side, then I would highly recommend trying the thick version of the <a href=\"https://www.flextail.com/products/zero-pillow?variant=44021972074743\" target=\"_blank\">Flextail Zero Pillow</a>. It has helped me get a few better nights of sleep at camp lately and if it does the same for you, then it’s worth exploring!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/flextail-zero-pillow-review/\">Flextail Zero Pillow Review: My New Favorite Pillow For Side Sleepers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a30e56f6f948966e687eaad061b3839ccfd55bb064c76c615e4d0e58e6d13694","category":"Cycling"}
