On Friday, a software developer named Georgi Gerganov created a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp\">\"llama.cpp\"</a> that can run Meta's new GPT-3-class AI large language model, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-on-your-pc-meta-unveils-new-ai-model-that-can-run-on-a-single-gpu/\">LLaMA</a>, locally on a Mac laptop. Soon thereafter, people worked out <a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/22\">how to run LLaMA on Windows</a> as well. Then someone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thiteanish/status/1635188333705043969\">showed it running</a> on a Pixel 6 phone, and next came <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miolini/status/1634982361757790209\">a Raspberry Pi</a> (albeit running very slowly).</p>\n\n<p>If this keeps up, we may be looking at a pocket-sized <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/get-ready-to-meet-the-chat-gpt-clones/\">ChatGPT competitor</a> before we know it.</p>\n<p>But let's back up a minute, because we're not quite there yet. (At least not todayâ€”as in literally today, March 13, 2023.) But what will arrive next week, no one knows.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923645#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923645&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a21e9a69887df07c11870443bcb08fa7b6f7bce847945cae5e9b4aad848852c","category":"Tech"}
