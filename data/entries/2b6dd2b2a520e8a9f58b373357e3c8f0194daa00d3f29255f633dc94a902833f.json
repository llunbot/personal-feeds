They were showing a customer build that was a “gravel bike with randonneuring spirit.” The image of that bike stuck with me for its understated utility, clean lines, beautiful paint, and custom touches like 3D-printed dropouts.</p>\n<p>That same year, the duo impressed Petor at <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2022-concourse-de-machines-part-two-race-and-show/\" target=\"_blank\">Concourse de Machines</a> with a prototype road bike featuring their unique in-house-designed dropouts, replaceable stainless liners, and even more innovative 3D-printed parts than on the Bespoked build.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-29.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-29.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-29.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-13.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-13.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-13.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>We saw Avalanche again at <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2023-bespoked-gallery-3/\" target=\"_blank\">last year’s Bespoked</a>, where they displayed a “neorandonneur” that was part road, part gravel, and another part travel bike. This was one of the rare times I’ve seen a truss fork on a drop bar bike, and I instantly wanted to set out on tour with it, traversing cobbled and dusty central European roads.</p>\n<p>While their show bikes have been head-turners, Marie and Laurent are wonderful folks – kind, humble, and inviting. We’ve had a running conversation about my connection to their home base of Paris and how I wanted to travel back to the city after a long time away. So they were at the top of my list to visit when I found out I’d be returning.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-7.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-7.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-7.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.avalanche-cycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Avalanche Cycles</a></h3>\n<p>The Avalanche workshop is located in Montreuil, a suburb (known in France as a commune) about a five-mile cycle from where we stayed in Paris’ 9th arrondissement.</p>\n<p>Outside the Boulevard Périphérique, it’s not a part of the city I’d typically think to ride to. But the experience of navigating over there was quite enjoyable. It provided some nice rolling terrain, views of eclectic architecture, and a number of locations we passed by that I plan to return to someday.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-28.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-28.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-28.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-28.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-28.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Marie and Laurent’s approach to building bikes stems from their background as professional industrial designers. Before founding Avalanche, they spent over ten years designing products for brands, primarily in the luxury and furniture sectors.</p>\n<p>Back in their design school days, they were accustomed to making things rather than letting them sit idle on paper or forgotten on a hard drive somewhere. To reconnect with the design-build methodology, they turned to bicycles and now fabricate steel, stainless steel, and titanium frames, forks, racks, and components.</p>\n<p>It’s important to point out that Marie and Laurent share all responsibilities at Avalanche – from customer evaluation to the finished frameset. As a woman, she is often mistaken as “just a painter” or “just a designer.” But you can find her and Laurent each divvying up their time across aspects of the process – from mitering tubes to welding, painting, and assembly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-14.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-14.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-14.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-8.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-8.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-8.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-11.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-11.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-16.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-16.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-16.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-30.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-30.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-30.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> </p>\n<p>In Marie’s words:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“We founded Avalanche to bring us closer to a universe and an object that is more in line with our values. We love the untold history of the bike, and the way it’s made hasn’t changed in decades. We want to use this strong legacy and classic aesthetic with more contemporary techniques like 3D-printing. This is why we like to work on frames with classic connections but by precisely drawing the connections and printing them in 3D.</em></p>\n<p><em>We use the same process for other classic parts, like the truss fork. From the start, we wanted to design our own dropout, fittings, yoke, to make each bike specific and recognizable. We paint all our bikes ourselves to push the customization of each machine as far as possible.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-46.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-46.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-46.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-46.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-46.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Titanium Gravel Bike with Truss Fork</h3>\n<p>Marie’s personal titanium gravel bike exemplifies the design and construction methods Avalanche is putting out these days. It contains various 3D-printed parts designed and printed explicitly for Avalanche’s titanium models. The dropouts, on which the Avalanche mountain branding silhouette can be discreetly seen, allow internal integration of the rear derailleur and dynamo lighting cables. Additionally, the printed seat cluster hides an integrated bolt for tightening a seat post.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-43.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-43.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-43.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-43.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-40.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-40.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-40.jpg?resize=1200,1799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-40.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-40.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-49.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-49.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-49.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-49.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-49.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Then there’s the titanium truss fork. Taking cues from classic truss forks, Avalanche designed and printed key junction sections, which they then connected with titanium tubing to obtain elegant lines in a contemporary form. Functionally, the truss concept balances hard braking forces in loaded or steep-and-fast scenarios while also offering a compliant ride quality for gravel and long road tours alike.</p>\n<p>All paint work was also done in-house. Marie commented that this one was particularly meticulous, both in choosing shades of natural colors and then matching with colors of accompanying componentry. The build ultimately came together with the addition of a greenish Ingrid crankset and ochre Nova Ride bottom bracket.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-50.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-50.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-50.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-50.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-50.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Steel / Stainless Lugged Neoclassic Randoneur</h3>\n<p>Laurent had just put the finishing touches on this gorgeous customer build as we visited the workshop. A fairly new direction for Avalanche, they designed the 316L stainless steel lugs 3D-printed to fit Columbus HSS Spirit tubes. Unlike the constraints of building with traditional lugs, 3D printing allows them to design a fully custom geometry around any combination of tubing profiles and componentry standards. This includes the custom 3D-printed stainless steel dropouts that accommodate UDH compatibility.</p>\n<p>The fork and racks are also fully custom-made in stainless steel. They’re designed specifically for a bag set selected by the customer. The paint, also done in-house, is inspired by the customer’s admiration for vintage Citroën 2CV Delage autos.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/ENSEMBLE-01-BD.jpg?fit=1200,1200&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/ENSEMBLE-01-BD.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/ENSEMBLE-01-BD.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/ENSEMBLE-01-BD.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/ENSEMBLE-01-BD.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-39.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-39.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-39.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-39.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-25.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-25.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Avalanche-Cycles-25.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://avalanchecycles.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cargo Cages</a> and More</h3>\n<p>Marie and Laurent have been prototyping a few made-in-house components, which they will roll out over the next few months.
