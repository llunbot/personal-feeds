An updated suspension layout with more travel. Slacker, lower geometry. More integration, including all-new internal frame storage. All-in-all, there are tons of updates to create a properly all-new carbon Lux Trail. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All-new Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, CFR\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_CFR.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Canyon)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-lux-trail-downcountry-bike-gets-new-front-triangle-slacker-geo-more-travel/\">only 2 years</a> since Canyon added a slightly longer travel light trail variant of their cross-country <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=canyon+lux\" target=\"_blank\">Lux</a> mountain bike family. But that one was just an updated front triangle to tweak the Lux’s geometry and travel for more trail riding prowess. Now, this new Canyon Lux Trail takes it a step further with a completely new frameset designed specifically as a fast trail bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, all the changes to the Lux Trail seem like relatively tiny steps. But while it’s definitely more evolution than revolution, the new Lux Trail is now a purpose-made all-rounder mountain bike, without losing that fast XC inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, marathon racing downhill\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_ultra-distance-marathon-racing.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspension-wise, the new 29er Lux Trail bumps up with 5mm of extra rear wheel travel. Now it’s a 115mm travel bike, paired to 120mm forks. That’s pretty short on today’s trail bike standards. We’ve even seen plenty of World Cup-level XC bikes that offer as much or more travel. But Canyon thinks that just solidifies the Lux Trail as a race-worthy mountain bike that can transition smoothly from technical XC racing, to long distance marathon XC racing, to just lightning-fast singletrack trail shredding too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of smoothness, the new Lux Trail does get a slightly refined suspension layout, too. It’s still a single-pivot with flex seatstays and a linkage-driven shock. But compared to the standard Lux, the new Lux Trail now hangs that short shock link from under the toptube in a move that promises increased small bump sensitivity. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1086\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio-800x1086.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, revised leverage ratio 115mm suspension kinematics\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio-800x1086.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio-221x300.jpg 221w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio-88x120.jpg 88w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio-768x1042.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio-1132x1536.jpg 1132w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_new-leverage-ratio.jpg 1400w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon says this completely flips the leverage ratio compared to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2022-canyon-lux-world-cup-carbon-xc-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Lux World Cup</a> XC bike. The result is said to make the bike feel like it has much more travel than its cross-country origins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Material-wise, the new carbon bike is available in two different specs. New to the Lux Trail is a top-tier CFR-level frame with a claimed weight of 1937g. Of pick from a more affordable CF carbon spec for a frame at 2101g. (<em>Both DIN claims for a painted frame with hardware.</em>) Interestingly, that’s still a tiny bit heavier than the old Lux Trail, even though it was only a CF-level frame. But the new bike promises a much more capable ride, plus new integration…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More MTB Integration</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, LOAD internal storage frame cutaway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_cutaway-LOAD-in-frame-storage.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything integrated is certainly the buzz-worthy trends these days. And Canyon’s latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/speedmax-cfr-moonshot-triathlon-bike/\">triathlon</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-canyon-endurace-road-bike-gets-storage-inside-and-ultralight-cfr-treatment/\" target=\"_blank\">road</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-canyon-grail-carbon-gravel-race-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel</a> bikes have already started adding in-frame storage. Now, the new Lux Trail is their first mountain bike to add internal LOAD in-frame storage. Much like the new Grail, the Lux Trail adds a glovebox door above the regular water bottle cage mount at the top of the downtube. And inside, you can slide a neoprene sleeve with all the spares you need for a trailside fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage-800x421.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, what's inside LOAD in-frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage-800x421.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage-297x156.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage-120x63.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage-768x404.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage-1536x808.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_whats-in-side_internal-frame-storage.jpg 1900w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that CO2, levers &amp; spare tube inside, Canyon also adds a few easier-access tools for quicker fixes. In the bar ends, they’ve partnered with Sahmurai for a collab set of v2 tubeless tire plug <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mini-reviews-sahmurai-sword-v2-fox-d30-pads-proviz-jacket-specialized-d30-gloves/\" target=\"_blank\">Swords</a>. Probably <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-sahmurai-sword-bar-end-tubeless-plugs-seal-tires-fast-easy/\" target=\"_blank\">my personal favorite</a> for their simplicity &amp; usability. Then, a simple flat mini multi-tool clips securely under the toptube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More integration comes from internal cable routing through the upper headset cup. Mountain bike haven’t gone fully hidden with integrated cables just yet (thankfully.) But tucking rear derailleur, dropper, and rear shock lockout cables inside does tidy the cockpit up quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tweaked geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, old vs. new geo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_old-vs-new-geo.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing the evolution concept. the new Canyon Lux Trail features gently tweaked geometry, as well. Up front, the headtube is just a 1/2° slacker, now at 67° for more confident descending. And it gets a 1.5° steeper seattube angle to 76° for better forward weight distribution while climbing. They are a bit shorter too, for improved standover and the option for longer dropper posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise the geometry is mostly the same. Same chainstay length, bottom bracket drop, and the same frame Reach as before. But all of the bikes get a slightly lower fit thanks to 2mm lower Stack across the board, as the upper headset cup is dropped slightly below the top of the toptube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry-800x296.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, updated geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry-800x296.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry-120x44.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry-768x284.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry-1536x568.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One really big geometry improvement though, is an additional frame size. Adding an extra-small opens up the light trail bike to more riders with a new 5 size, XS-XL range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Lux Trail – Pricing, Options &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Lux Trail carbon downcountry mountain bike, CFR LTD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-Canyon-Lux-Trail-carbon-downcountry-mountain-bike_top-Lux-Trail-CFR-LTD.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>2023 Canyon Lux Trail CFR LTD</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ground-up redesigned Canyon Lux Trail is available in 2 top-tier CFR builds and 4 more affordable CF carbon spec options.
