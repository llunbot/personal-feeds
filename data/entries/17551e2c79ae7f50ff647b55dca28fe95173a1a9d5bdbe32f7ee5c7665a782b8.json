Their highlights appear to be a soft but secure fit dialed in with a single Boa Li2, a wide grippy Vibram sole, reasonably light weight for a nylon-soled shoe, and simple good looks.

The new shoes inherit key fit tech from their latest top-tier <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-tempr-cfr-shoe-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Tempr CFR</a> shoes, but the new Scamprs prioritize comfort on-bike and walkability off-the-bike, all at half the cost of those carbon XC racing shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Scampr all-rounder walkable gravel eMTB mountain bike shoes, hike-a-bike creek crossing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_gravel-hike-a-bike-capable-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s really the wrap-around PerformFit Wrap floating strap design that comes from the Temprs. The idea seems to be a softer, more comfortable fit thanks to a well-ventilated bootie-like stretch mesh upper that you just slip your foot into. Then, the stiffer and more supportive PerformFit microfiber straps wrap over and cinch your instep down and “locks-in” your heel. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Asymmetric, single Boa retention</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_top-asymmetric-view-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_top-asymmetric-view-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Scampr all-rounder walkable gravel eMTB mountain bike shoes, gray top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_top-asymmetric-view-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_top-asymmetric-view-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_top-asymmetric-view-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_top-asymmetric-view-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-mountain-bike-shoes_top-asymmetric-view-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The asymmetric and overlapping design of the 3 straps is secured with a single Boa Li2 dial on the outside of the shoe, pulling a single zig-zag of woven fiber lacing through webbing lace guides. The middle strap appears to pull more around the midfoot of the sock-like upper from the instep, while the top &amp; bottom straps pull all the way around the foot from attachment points at the heel &amp; toe of the sole.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Scampr all-rounder walkable gravel eMTB mountain bike shoes, wbike trail ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-mountain-bike-shoes_eMTB-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having tried this shoe in particular, my experience with similar Boa solutions suggests that instep &amp; heel lock security should be solid. However fine adjustment of forefoot tension will likely be harder to achieve. But I’d be curious to see how the overlapping strap layout impacts the fine fit control you will naturally sacrifice with a single dial pulling across 3 sets of lace loops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Scampr all-rounder walkable gravel eMTB mountain bike shoes, Alpine ebike ride with mom\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_NeuronON-ebiking-with-mom-and-a-cow-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon says the new Scampr is “<em>the ultimate go-anywhere do-anything shoe for every adventurer</em>“, developed to “<em>navigate rough, uneven and technical terrain with a stable yet walkable sole no matter where or how far off the map you’re riding and walking</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Scampr all-rounder walkable gravel eMTB mountain bike shoes, gray pair agled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Canyon-Scampr-all-rounder-walkable-gravel-eMTB-mountain-bike-shoes_gray-pair-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>single BOA Li2 dial retention</li>\n\n\n\n<li>BOA Lifetime Guarantee on dial &amp;
