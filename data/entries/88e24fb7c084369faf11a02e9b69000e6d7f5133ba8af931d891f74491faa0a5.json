It sits between the crown of the fork and the bottom of the headtube, and the top of the headtube and the stem.</p>\n<p>There are almost as many variants of headset as there are types of bike, and making sense of which headset your bike uses, how it works and how to buy a replacement one is not a simple task.</p>\n<p>Here’s our guide to help you get to grips with the humble headset.</p>\n<h2>What are the parts of a headset, and how do they work?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bearings generally sit with a sliding fit in headset cups.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There are a few different types of headset available, but they all function in a similar way.</p>\n<p>The two bearings at either end of the head tube are what make things work. Traditionally, these have been held in pressed ‘cups’, but modern bikes also see bearings fitted directly into the frame.</p>\n<p>The cups (or integrated assembly) provide the interface that locates the bearings in the frame.</p>\n<p>The fork steerer slides into these bearings.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Older loose bearings rolled directly on the hardened steel race.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A crown race at the base of the steerer mates with the bottom bearing.</p>\n<p>The conical shape of the race is centred on the fork steerer. This means it is self-centring on the bearing and, when preload is applied, the angled shape ensures it supports both axial and lateral loads. A top race performs the corresponding duties for the upper bearing.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the axial load experienced by the fork during riding will be carried by the lower bearing, because this is effectively sitting on top of the fork.</p>\n<p>The top bearing carries only the axial load exerted by the preload that’s applied to hold the fork in place securely.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the interface between bearing and fork is called the race (crown race and top race) because it originally acted as the raceway, with the bearing balls in the headset rolling directly on it.</p>\n<p>However, describing this component as a race on modern bikes is, strictly speaking, incorrect.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is the upper bearing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The ubiquity of cartridge bearings (sealed units that contain all the rolling elements) means it should be more correctly defined as a ‘seat’ or ‘mating surface’.</p>\n<p>Because the cartridge bearing comes as a pre-assembled unit, the crown race doesn’t have to support the ball bearings, these are contained inside the bearing assembly itself.</p>\n<p>Finally, preload must be applied to the bearings to ensure everything is secured and remains in place. The general rule is that preload should be enough to prevent any rocking or movement of the steerer tube, while still allowing the fork to rotate freely.</p>\n<h2>What type of headset do I have on my bike?</h2>\n<h3>What is a threaded headset?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’ll likely find a threaded headset on older or more traditional builds.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Velo Orange</i></span></div>\n<p>These days, you’re unlikely to find threaded headsets outside of budget bikes, some track and touring bikes, or on retro builds. However, given they were the standard for many years, they’re still worth talking about.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This schematic shows how a threaded headset works.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Br_threadedheadset.png\"><strong>Wikipedia Creative Commons Thewinch</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>On a threaded headset, the bearings sit in cups that are pressed into the top and bottom of the head tube. A race sits on the fork crown, completing the bearing assembly at the bottom of the head tube.</p>\n<p>The steerer tube of the fork is threaded and a threaded race is screwed into the top of the fork to snug up against the top bearing.</p>\n<p>The top race will generally incorporate a bearing cap with seals to shield the bearings from debris and the elements. Tightening this allows you to set the preload. This assembly is then secured with a locknut, holding the fork in place.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A quill stem is held in place with an expanding bung or wedge.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The stem – known as a quill stem – attaches separately, sliding inside the steerer tube. It is secured by tightening the top bolt, which engages an expanding wedge at its base to clamp the stem in place.</p>\n<p>Depending on the length of the quill, you can adjust the height of the stem easily by sliding it further up or down inside the steerer and fixing it in the correct position.</p>\n<p>However, the threaded design brings with it a few complications.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fork must be matched precisely to the head tube length of the frame – it’s important that the steerer of the fork is just long enough to provide enough engagement for the threads of the locknut, without the locknut bottoming out on the top of the steerer.</p>\n<p>The adjustment of a threaded headset also requires specific spanners sized to (the large dimensions of) the threaded race and locknut – not something you would necessarily want to take with you on rides.</p>\n<p>Threaded headsets can sometimes have an annoying tendency to undo themselves due to a phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_(mechanical)\" target=\"_blank\">precession</a>. Regular care and maintenance can combat this, but still, it can be an issue.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> On the right bike, a quill stem can give a really elegant overall look.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://velo-orange.com/collections/headsets\"><strong>Velo Orange</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>Because threaded headsets comprise multiple overlapping components, they have increased weight over modern threadless designs, which are now more commonplace.</p>\n<p>However, you’ll still get a few misty-eyed romantics lamenting the loss of the elegant lines of a threaded headset. As a result of this nostalgia, threaded headsets are going through a bit of a resurgence in the custom-bike market.</p>\n<h3>What is a threadless / A-headset?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A typical external threadless headset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The threadless headset is a much simpler and arguably superior design. It’s quicker and easier to service, which can be done with standard tools – hex or Torx keys in most cases.</p>\n<p>As with the threaded headset, bearings are fitted at the top and bottom of the head tube. A crown race sits at the bottom of the steerer tube and mates with the lower bearings.</p>\n<p>But, unlike the threaded design, the fork is not captive to the headset and is only held in place by a stem clamped to the steerer extending through the head tube.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This schematic shows how a threadless headset is put together.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Br_aheadset.png\"><strong>Wikipedia Creative Common Thewinch</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>The stem is clamped to the outside of the steerer tube, and its height can be adjusted with spacers.</p>\n<p>Before tightening the stem, preload must be applied through the top cap, with a bolt that ‘pulls’ on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fit-a-star-nut/\" target=\"_blank\">a star nut</a> or bung fixed inside the steerer tube.</p>\n<p>Star nuts are only really used with metal steerer tubes. The two rows of ‘star-shaped’ teeth are curved so they bend back when pressed into the steerer, but bite into place when a preload is applied, pulling against the direction of the teeth.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A star nut on the left, and an expander on the right.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For carbon forks (with a carbon steerer), an expander (also known as a bung) is installed, which spreads the load across a wider area inside the steerer.</p>\n<p>Expanders also mitigates against crush injuries of the carbon steerer, as they provide a ‘solid’ element to support the carbon when the stem is clamped in place.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tightening the top cap applies preload to the headset bearings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The preload force is transmitted via the stem (and spacers), which sit slightly proud of the steerer tube at the top (around a 2–3mm gap is ideal), ‘pulling’ the steerer tube up, applying preload and seating the fork properly in the bearings.</p>\n<p>The conical crown race locates the steerer with respect to the lower bearing at the base of the head tube.</p>\n<p>The top bearing interfaces with a slotted conical compression ring. As preload is applied, the compression ring effectively gets wedged between the top bearing and the steerer tube, tightening around the steerer as preload is applied and the slot closes.</p>\n<p>This secures the steerer tube with respect to the top bearing. Unlike the threaded steerer, where the threaded race provides a direct connection with the steerer tube, here the compression ring is required to take up any ‘slop’ between the steerer and the bearing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The split compression provides the interface between steerer and top bearing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On high-end headsets, the compression ring is often a captive element of the headset cap that sits on top of the headset to seal it from the elements. With preload applied, the stem can be tightened, clamping things in place.</p>\n<p>Once the stem has been tightened, the top cap doesn’t serve any purpose. It’s just there to apply the initial preload before the stem secures the whole assembly.</p>\n<p>There are a few different types of threadless headset available, but they all follow the same basic assembly principle. The differences are mainly in how the bearings are fitted into the frame.</p>\n<h2>What is an external threadless headset?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An external headset is the original threadless design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This is the original threadless design. The bearings sit in external bearing cups, and the bearing cups are pressed into the top and bottom of the head tube.</p>\n<p>The bearings are generally a transition fit inside the headset cups. That means that while they can still be removed by hand with some force, they sit snugly inside their seat.</p>\n<p>The bearings generally have a conical interface with the cup, which helps secure and locate the bearing inside the cup when preload is applied.</p>\n<p>Some manufacturers (such as Chris King) choose to press-fit the bearings inside the headset cups.</p>\n<p>This improves the security of the bearing and prevents movement, but does mean the bearings can’t (officially) be removed for servicing and have to be cleaned and serviced in situ.</p>\n<h2>What is an internal / semi-integrated headset?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A semi-integrated headset sits within the headtube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Josh Patterson / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As above, the bearings sit in cups, but these, in turn, sit inside, rather than proud of, the head tube, with only a small lip protruding to locate the cup and prevent it being pressed all the way inside the head tube.</p>\n<p>In order to accommodate the bearings inside the cup, the head tube has a larger overall diameter.</p>\n<p>A side-effect of this is that larger diameter tubing can be used, resulting in increases in stiffness of the frame in this area.</p>\n<h2>What is an integrated headset?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An integrated headset creates a clean look (if you clean your bike).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>An integrated headset does away with the bearing cups, with the bearings dropped into pre-shaped seats at either end of the head tube – the head tube takes over the duties of the bearing cups.</p>\n<p>The bearings actually sit loose within these seats – they aren’t fitted with the press fit that you might expect from components, such as press-fit bottom-brackets.</p>\n<p>Instead, the head tube is bored with conical seats. When preload is applied, these angled seats result in the bearings self-aligning, as well as securing them in place, creating a rigid assembly.</p>\n<p>It has been claimed this configuration is a cost-saving measure on behalf of manufacturers. Rather than pressing a bearing cup into the frame, the bearing can simply be dropped in during assembly.</p>\n<p>It also appears to allow slightly more relaxed manufacturing tolerances, though it is critical the two bores are machined concentrically and on the same axis for good fitting of the headset.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bearings just drop in to preformed seats, and are held in place by the preload</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The standard angle for the conical bore is 45 degrees. 36 degrees is now considered obsolete, but may occasionally be found on older frames.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the seats may be machined out square with respect to the head tube and inserts can then be pressed in with the required contact angle.</p>\n<p>Conceptually, the zero stack and integrated bearing arrangements could also be adapted to threaded headsets as well.</p>\n<h2>Mixing headset standards</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Manufacturers will often choose to mix different types of headset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some head tubes use a mix of different designs, for example, an external cup at the bottom and a semi-integrated design at the top.</p>\n<h2>What is a crown race?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The crown race supports the cycling load.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Apart from the interface with the frame, the headset must also interface with the steerer tube.</p>\n<p>Forks have traditionally been fitted with a crown race near the crown of the fork. Originally, loose ball bearings were used for the headset, and this provided a hardened and precisely machined surface for the balls to roll on.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, nowadays, with the common use of cartridge bearings, this part is strictly speaking a seat (given that the races are integral to the cartridge bearing). However, the term ‘race’ has carried over, in this case it means a surface for the bearing to mate with.</p>\n<p>Crown races are often headset specific, with many different variations of the precise dimensions and interface with the bearings. Therefore, if you are swapping a headset, you will probably need to swap the crown race on the fork.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A split fork race is easier to install and remove.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cartridge bearings also allow for split crown races to be used, easing installation. Because the crown race acts as a seat, it can be slotted without negative impact, allowing it to be opened up to loosen the fit when installing or removing it.</p>\n<p>The use of cartridge bearings has also allowed for the development of integrated crown races. Because the load is spread by the outer seat of the bearing (rather than hard bearing balls rolling directly on the seat), softer materials, such as carbon fibre, can be used to construct the ‘race’.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An integrated crown race (this one isn’t removable) interfaces directly with the headset bearings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>An integrated crown race is simply a steerer tube that has been shaped to mate precisely with the outer race of the headset bearing. This takes over the duties of the crown race that would have been installed before.</p>\n<p>Integrated crown races typically come in two different angles – 36 or 45 degrees.</p>\n<h2>What are the common steerer diameters?</h2>\n<p>The other key part to consider is the steerer diameter. The standard sizes are 1 inch, 1 1/8 inch, 1.25 inch and 1.5 inch steerers.</p>\n<p>You may occasionally come across a 1-inch threadless steerer, but you’re more likely to find a threaded steerer in this size. 1 1/8 inch threaded steerers are, however, quite common.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tapered steerers are widespread on modern bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tapered steerer tubes are the most common arrangement on modern bikes. This attempts to provide the best of both worlds, with a wide crown that provides improved steering stiffness, with a tapered top section that saves a little weight. This is found on both mountain bikes and road bikes.</p>\n<p>The corresponding shape of the head tube (known as a ‘frustum’ in engineering circles) also allows frame design to be optimised, with the larger lower section providing a larger surface area to connect with the down tube.</p>\n<p>This allows designers to increase stiffness here, with the top tube kept relatively skinny to improve riding comfort and reduce weight.</p>\n<h2>SHIS Standards: ZS, IS, EC. What does it all mean?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It was once all so simple with only a few headset standards on the market.

The number is given in whole millimetres, but does not always correspond exactly to the dimensions of the bore.</p>\n<p>It should be considered as a code for the different sizes, with each number uniquely identifying a head-tube diameter.</p>\n<h3>SHIS for external cup (EC) headsets</h3>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Common name</th><th>SHIS name</th><th>Bore inside diameter (mm)</th><th>Cup outside diameter (mm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 in JIS</td><td>EC29</td><td>29.85 – 29.9</td><td>30 – 30.1</td>        </tr><tr><td>1 in Pro</td><td>EC30</td><td>30.05 – 30.1</td><td>30.2 – 30.3</td>        </tr><tr><td>1 in BMX</td><td>EC33</td><td>32.6 – 32.7</td><td>32.8 – 32.9</td>        </tr><tr><td>1-1/8 in external</td><td>EC34</td><td>33.9 – 33.95</td><td>34.05 – 34.15</td>        </tr><tr><td>1-1/4 in external</td><td>EC37</td><td>36.9 – 36.95</td><td>37.05 – 37.15</td>        </tr><tr><td>1.5 in external</td><td>EC44</td><td>43.95 – 44</td><td>44.1 – 44.15</td>        </tr><tr><td>1.5 in external</td><td>EC49</td><td>49.57 – 49.61</td><td>49.7 – 49.75</td>        </tr><tr><td>1.5 in external</td><td>EC56</td><td>55.9 – 55.95</td><td>56 – 56.05</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>The bore depth for an external headset should be at least 15mm.</p>\n<h3>SHIS for semi-integrated/zero-stack (ZS) headsets</h3>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Common name</th><th>SHIS name</th><th>Bore inside diameter (mm)</th><th>Cup outside diameter (mm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 in semi-integrated</td><td>ZS41</td><td>41.35 – 41.4</td><td>41.45 – 41.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>1-1/8 in semi-integrated</td><td>ZS44</td><td>43.95 – 44</td><td>44.05 – 44.1</td>        </tr><tr><td>1-1/2 in semi-integrated</td><td>ZS49</td><td>49.57 – 49.61</td><td>49.7 -

This is particularly relevant for integrated crown races, where the angle is fixed at either 36 or 45 degrees.</p>\n<p>As an example, a traditional 1-1/8in external threadless headset with a straight steerer would be defined as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>The upper cup would be <strong>EC34 </strong>with a <strong>28.6 </strong>steerer. This is written as <strong>EC34/28.6.</strong></li>\n<li>The lower cup would also be <strong>EC34</strong> but with a <strong>30 </strong>crown race. This is written as <strong>EC34/30.</strong></li>\n</ul><ul><li>These two codes are combined as <strong>EC34/28.6 | EC34/30</strong> to fully define the upper and lower stack of the headset.</li>\n</ul><p>Headset manufacturers may also choose to specify the stack height for the upper and lower bearing stack by adding an ‘H’ followed by the stack height in millimetres.</p>\n<p>In our experience, this measurement is unlikely to vary much between headset designs, and any differences are likely to be negligible.</p>\n<h2>Special and unusual headsets</h2>\n<p>Defining the SHIS code will tell you what kind of headset will fit the bike, but there are also some additional choices you can make.</p>\n<p>Special-purpose headsets can significantly change your ride and are becoming more popular in mountain biking as a cheaper way to tune your geometry.</p>\n<h3>Angle headset / AngleSet</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cane Creek AngleSet angles the steerer in the head tube to modify your geometry.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Popularised by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-fit-an-angled-headset-to-adjust-your-bikes-head-angle/\" target=\"_blank\">Cane Creek under the AngleSet name</a>, this headset allows you to tune a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\" target=\"_blank\">bike’s head angle</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of the steerer tube running vertically through the head tube, an angled headset makes use of the ‘spare space’ inside, to angle the steerer by up to 2 degrees.</p>\n<p>Slackening the head angle in this way can lead to improvements in the handling of a mountain bike and doesn’t affect the seat angle and bottom-bracket height as it would with offset shock bushings</p>\n<h3>Reach-adjust headset</h3>\n<p>Similarly, a <a href=\"https://www.workscomponents.co.uk/reach-adjust-headsets-21-c.asp\" target=\"_blank\">reach-adjust headset</a> allows you to fine-tune the reach of a bike. Rather than adjust the angle of the steerer, the whole steerer is offset within the head tube.</p>\n<h3>ViscoSet</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ViscoSet uses keyed washers, which together with a fluorocarbon grease offer steering damping.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One interesting headset we’ve come across is <a href=\"https://www.canecreek.com/product/viscoset/\" target=\"_blank\">Cane Creek’s ViscoSet</a>.

Suspension provides more than enough damping to reduce the forces going into the headset.</p>\n<p>With that said, you should look for ample sealing, good availability of spare parts and, if it’s important to you, low weight.</p>\n<h2>All about bearings</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cartridge bearings contain all the bearing parts in one unit, making assembly a lot simpler.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bicycle-bearings-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">Bearings</a> come in two flavours.</p>\n<p>In the past, loose balls were sometimes held in place in bearing cages. That has changed, with the majority of headsets now using cartridge bearings.</p>\n<p><span>High-end cartridge bearings can also be serviced, but in many cases, it’s just as easy to swap them out for new ones. </span><span>Because the bearing assembly in contained in one unit, it’s an easy drop-in replacement.</span>Because the headset has to deal with complex loading, with force transmitted along the axis of the steerer as well as laterally, it should be fitted with angular contact bearings that are able to support load in both these directions.</p>\n<h2>How to maintain and fix a headset</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like other components, headsets need to be serviced.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>If your headset feels gritty or horrible, it might be time to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-service-a-headset-and-replace-headset-bearings/\">service your headset and/or replace your headset bearings</a>.</p>\n<p>At that point, take the fork out of the head tube and check the bearings. They may need replacing or cleaning and regreasing. It’s an easy enough job that doesn’t require many tools.</p>\n<p>You should also regularly check headsets for play, which could indicate wear or a loose headset. We recommend applying the front brake and rocking the bike back and forward while grappling the crown of the fork.</p>\n<p>If there’s any play of the fork in the steerer tube, or any knocking or clunking noises, check the headset for tightness. If that doesn’t rectify the issue, some servicing is likely due.</p>","author":"Benedict Pfender","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"88e24fb7c084369faf11a02e9b69000e6d7f5133ba8af931d891f74491faa0a5","category":"Cycling"}
