The second public iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas come almost a month after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-1/\">released the first betas</a>. Note that while Apple is calling these the third betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, there was technically never a second public beta. Apple had to pull the second developer betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, and opted to go straight to the third beta rather than releasing an updated public beta version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nPublic beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the \"Beta Updates\" option, and toggling on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta.

With this turned on, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> authentication is required for viewing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Keychain passwords, turning off Lost Mode, erasing an ‌iPhone‌'s contents, using saved payment methods in Safari, and more. There is no passcode entry option should ‌Face ID‌ or ‌Touch ID‌ fail.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCertain actions, such as changing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> password, updating a device passcode, turning off <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>, and removing ‌Face ID‌ require authentication and also a one-hour security delay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also adds <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/\">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> subscribers build playlists with friends, family members, and others who share their musical tastes.
