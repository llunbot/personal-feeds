Coming in at $5 billion, Europa Clipper will try to help scientists answer a bold question commensurate with its eye-popping cost: Are there places below the surface of Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life?</p>\n<p>Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon and is significantly more interesting to scientists searching for life. The icy world harbors a vast global ocean of liquid water underneath a frozen crust. Clipper will sail past Europa nearly 50 times, coming as close as 16 miles (25 kilometers) from its icy surface to interrogate the moon with a sophisticated suite of nine instruments.</p>\n<p>Jordan Evans, who leads the team developing Europa Clipper at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told Ars on Tuesday the mission is on track to depart for Jupiter during a 21-day planetary launch window opening on October 10, 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975039#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975039&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"611c3cd9d8931718f3d0654f147ea8e415a0c558b63b20c2a8677cd35d0e76c2","category":"Tech"}
