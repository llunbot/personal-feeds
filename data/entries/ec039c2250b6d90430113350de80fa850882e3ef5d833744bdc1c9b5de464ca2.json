Shoppers have until 11:59 p.m. PST on December 2 to take advantage of this offer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdditionally, if you just want Hulu (with ads), you can get it for $0.99 per month for a year, down from $9.99 per month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Paramount+</h2>\r<br />\nYou can get either <a href=\"https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/153062/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F\"><strong>Paramount+ Essential or Paramount+ with Showtime</strong></a> for $2.99 per month for your first two months this Black Friday.
