{"title":"★ The Sordid Tale of Rudy Giuliani’s Yankees World Series Rings","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/the_sordid_tale_of_rudy_giulianis_yankees_world_series_rings","date":1729639049000,"content":"\n<p>The <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/22/giuliani-getting-his\">aforelinked piece</a> on Rudy Giuliani losing his possessions to pay the two Georgia election officials he was convicted of defaming made reference to the dispute regarding his four World Series rings, from the Yankees championships during his time as mayor, in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000. The current dispute is over Giuliani’s deeply suspicious claim that he gave the rings to his <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/andrew-ruins-rudy-giulianis-inaugural-address-cold-open/2860970\">nitwit son</a> Andrew in 2018, so they’re no longer his for the court to take.</p>\n\n<p>But how did Rudy get them in the first place? It’s generally reported that these rings were gifts from the Yankees, given to him, while mayor of New York, after each win. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.mensjournal.com/news/world-series-rings-rudy-giuliani-defamation-lawsuit\">a report today from the AP</a> that just glosses over their provenance.</p>\n\n<p>The real story is — shocker — a scandal. An embarrassment for the Yankees, but almost certainly a crime on Giuliani’s part. That he received the rings in the first place seemingly wasn’t publicly known until 2007, during his ill-fated run for president, when he campaigned while wearing one of them. The whole sordid saga was exposed by reporter Wayne Barrett for The Village Voice in May 2007, in a 6,000-word feature under the headline “<a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/the-yankees-clean-up-man/\">The Yankees’ Clean-Up Man</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Giuliani has been seen on the campaign trail wearing a World\nSeries ring, a valuable prize we never knew he had. Indeed, the\nYankees have told the Voice that he has <em>four</em> rings, one for every\nworld championship the Yankees won while he was mayor. Voice calls\nto other cities whose teams won the Series in the past decade have\ndetermined that Giuliani is the only mayor with a ring, much less\nfour. If it sounds innocent, wait for the price tag. These are\ncertainly no Canal Street cubic zirconia knockoffs.</p>\n\n<p>With Giuliani’s name inscribed in the 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000\ndiamond-and-gold rings, memorabilia and baseball experts say they\nare collectively worth a minimum of $200,000. The Yankees say that\nGiuliani did pay for his rings — but only $16,000, and years\nafter he had left office. Anyone paying for the rings is as\nunusual as a mayor getting one, since neither the Yankees nor any\nother recent champion have sold rings to virtually anyone. The\nmeager payment, however, is less than half of the replacement\nvalue of the rings, and that’s a fraction of the market price,\nespecially with the added value of Giuliani’s name.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more troubling is that Giuliani’s receipt of the rings may\nbe a serious breach of the law, and one that could still be\nprosecuted. New York officials are barred from taking a gift of\ngreater than $50 value from anyone doing business with the city,\nand under Giuliani, that statute was enforced aggressively against\nothers. His administration forced a fire department chief, for\nexample, to retire, forfeit $93,105 in salary, and pay a $6,000\nfine for taking Broadway tickets to two shows and a free week in a\nski condo from a city vendor. The city’s Conflicts of Interest\nBoard (COIB) has applied the gift rule to discounts as well,\nunless the cheaper rate “is available generally to all government\nemployees.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Needless to say, World Series rings were not available for purchase by anyone else, at any price.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Four sources, two from the manufacturer and two from City Hall,\nhave told the Voice that a ring was made with Giuliani’s name on\nit in 1996 or early 1997. The City Hall sources also recall him\nreceiving the ring at that time. In addition, one of these\nsources, joined by two other ex–Giuliani staffers, says the mayor\ndid not take possession of the three additional rings until much\nlater. The best recollection of these aides is that he got these\nrings as a package near the end of his term in 2001, just as his\nadministration closed a number of critical deals with the Yankees.\nWhile the Yankees could offer no explanation for why he paid for\nthree rings in one year and the 1996 ring a year later, the\nchronology cited by the sources suggests one. He paid for the\nthree he received together, and then later remembered to pay for\nthe one he’d gotten long before. He paid $2,000 less for the 1996\nring than he did for the others — another indication of how\ndisconnected from market factors this reputed sale was, since many\nring experts believe the 1996 ring, which ended a nearly\ntwo-decade Yankee drought, is the most valuable of the four.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve quoted quite a bit here from Barrett’s reporting, but there’s so much more, all of it crooked as hell — a sordid tale of both large-scale graft and petty grift. It’s an extraordinary example of investigative reporting. <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/the-yankees-clean-up-man/\">Read it and laugh</a> at now-disgraced Giuliani’s expense. Barrett’s report concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those who know Giuliani well say that when he thinks he’s in love,\nhe waives all the rules of acceptable conduct. But the story of\nhim and his team is not just a saga of disturbing infatuation and\nself-absorption. It is an object lesson in what kind of a\npresident he would be, a window into his willingness to lend\nhimself to a special interest, to blur all lines that ordinarily\nseparate personal and public lives. It is not so much that he\nidentified with the Yankees. It was himself that he was serving.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Turns out, we eventually got exactly that kind of president, and might get him again. It’s just that his name isn’t Giuliani.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3ff5f04a792bb8c48cca51afadb2c3c0915e80ba40540d2bb6d1e9c775682c07","category":"Tech"}
