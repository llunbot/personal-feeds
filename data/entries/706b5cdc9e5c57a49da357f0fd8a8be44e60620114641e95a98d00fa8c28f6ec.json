The initial report of this feature was made on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/1at8g93/apple_music_470beta_1359_for_android_apple/&amp;xcust=1-1-2242439-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Reddit by _22cm_</a> and has been confirmed by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-music-testing-playlist-import-feature/&amp;xcust=1-1-2242439-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshots provided by _22cm_show the overall user interface in Italian, but the transfer feature appears in English in the app’s Library and Settings sections. However, the feature doesn’t work yet; _22cm_ said it hangs when attempting to select a service.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-music-android-transfer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Music Android playlist transfer\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-music-android-transfer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2385w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-music-android-transfer.jpg?resize=300%2C220&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-music-android-transfer.jpg?resize=768%2C563&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-music-android-transfer.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-music-android-transfer.jpg?resize=1536%2C1126&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-music-android-transfer.jpg?resize=2048%2C1502&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"880\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/1at8g93/apple_music_470beta_1359_for_android_apple/&amp;xcust=1-1-2242439-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit/_22cm_</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other users responded to the Reddit post, stating that they don’t see the transfer feature in the betas they are using. This could indicate that Apple is performing A/B testing to gauge performance and usability, where some beta users see the feature and others don’t. Apple could be testing on the Android app to help limit the number of users in the beta test. Apple has not commented on the feature, and there is no word on whether this feature will become available in the iOS Apple Music app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature seems to be done in partnership with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.songshift.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2242439-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">SongShift</a>.
