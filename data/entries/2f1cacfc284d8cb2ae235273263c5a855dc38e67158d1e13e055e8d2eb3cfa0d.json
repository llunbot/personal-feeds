The first, titled <em>Boundless</em>, launches tonight at 9 pm ET. More will follow in the coming weeks and months.</p>\n<p>The announcement follows a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/apple-debuts-first-new-3d-video-content-for-vision-pro-in-two-months/\">long, slow period</a> for new Vision Pro-specific video content from Apple. The headset launched in early February with a handful of Immersive Video episodes ranging from five to 15 minutes each. Since then, only three new videos have been added.</p>\n<p>On March 28, Apple released a highlight reel of Major League Soccer plays from the season that had ended months prior. A second episode of <em>Prehistoric Planet</em>, Apple's Immersive Video dinosaur nature documentary, went live on April 19. Likewise, a new episode of the <em>Adventure</em> series titled \"Parkour\" landed on May 24.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037983#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037983&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f1cacfc284d8cb2ae235273263c5a855dc38e67158d1e13e055e8d2eb3cfa0d","category":"Tech"}
