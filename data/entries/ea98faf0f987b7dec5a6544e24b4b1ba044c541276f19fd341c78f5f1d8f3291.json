The Ultrawide setting is equivalent to two 4K displays side-by-side, and it is a notable improvement over the current Mac Virtual Display that's available in visionOS 2.1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Mac Virtual Display allows the Vision Pro to be connected to a Mac with the Vision Pro serving as the display for the machine. The virtual Mac desktop works just like a standard desktop with an external display, but Vision Pro does not support multiple displays. As a solution, Apple has added the option for a wider display to maximize space.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-seeds-visionos-2-2-beta-2/\">Apple Seeds Second Beta of visionOS 2.2 to Developers With Ultrawide Mac Virtual Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-visionos-2-2-to-developers-with-ultrawide-mac-virtual-display.2442782/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ea98faf0f987b7dec5a6544e24b4b1ba044c541276f19fd341c78f5f1d8f3291","category":"Apple"}
