The telephoto camera has a folded glass structure below the lens, which Apple refers to as Tetraprism technology. It reflects light four times over, allowing for a longer focal length of 120mm. The ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will both offer 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple uses 3D sensor-shift optical image stabilization for the Telephoto lens in the Pro Max, and because it is able to move in three directions, it delivers twice as many micro-adjustments as before for crisp photos even when zoomed all the way in.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen initial stock is spent, which is expected to be around the fourth quarter, Apple will reportedly use its secondary vendors Foxconn and Cowell to manufacture the folded zoom module as well to drive down costs. Meanwhile, Sharp is not expected to supply any camera modules for any iPhones launching the year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/iphone-16-pro-telephoto-lens-both-models/\">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models to Use Telephoto Lens From Same Supplier</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/both-iphone-16-pro-models-to-use-telephoto-lens-from-same-supplier.2434402/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b3dfbc7136399769faddc87bf9d75e6fa56ad663e57479874bd299d83c60231","category":"Apple"}
