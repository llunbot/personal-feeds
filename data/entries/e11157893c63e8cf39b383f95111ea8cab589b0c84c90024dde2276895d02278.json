Things are mostly quiet here at the Ars Orbiting HQ—the gift shop on the mess deck is still selling <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/store/\">mugs and other merch</a>, if anyone wants some Ars stuff!—but the e-commerce communications panel is beeping and it says we've got more deals to show you guys for Cyber Monday!</p>\n<p>Cyber Monday is the thing that happens <em>after</em> Black Friday, where the deals keep going past the weekend and erupt into the next week, like some kind of out-of-control roller coaster of capitalism careening off the rails and into the crowd. Headphones! Power stations! Tablets! More board games! We've got so many things for you to buy!</p>\n<p>A couple of quick notes: First, we're going to continue updating this list throughout Monday as things change, so if you don't see anything that tickles your fancy right now, check back in a few hours! Additionally, although we're making every effort to keep our prices accurate, deals are constantly shifting around, and an item's actual price might have drifted from what we list. <em>Caveat emptor</em> and all that.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2024/12/its-black-friday-and-here-are-the-best-shopping-deals-we-could-find/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2024/12/its-black-friday-and-here-are-the-best-shopping-deals-we-could-find/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e11157893c63e8cf39b383f95111ea8cab589b0c84c90024dde2276895d02278","category":"Tech"}
