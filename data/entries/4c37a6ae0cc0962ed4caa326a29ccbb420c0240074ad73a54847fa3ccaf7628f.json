Legal experts told the Times this could be a way for TikTok to dodge arbitration claims filed en masse that can cost companies millions more in fees than they expected to pay through individual arbitration.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most significantly, TikTok also added a section to its terms that mandates that all legal complaints be filed within one year of any alleged harm caused by using the app. The terms now say that TikTok users \"forever waive\" rights to pursue any older claims. And unlike a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230531234951/https:/www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/terms-of-service/en\">prior version</a> of TikTok's terms of service archived in May 2023, users do not seem to have any options to opt out of waiving their rights.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991450#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991450&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c37a6ae0cc0962ed4caa326a29ccbb420c0240074ad73a54847fa3ccaf7628f","category":"Tech"}
