According to new renders, Apple will be substantially reducing the bezels on the iPad Pro resulting in a near full-screen design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/leaksapplepro/status/1770485308804534473&amp;xcust=1-1-2275788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">an image posted by LeaksApplePro</a> on X (formerly Twitter), the new iPad Pro will have a similar shape to the existing model with smaller bezels all around. The current models have a bezel width of about 9mm and haven’t changed since the 3rd-generation arrived in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A separate post by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://weibo.com/5143897135/O5VxfdQGB&amp;xcust=1-1-2275788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a> (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/20/ipad-pro-bezels-to-get-even-smaller-this-year-rumor-says/&amp;xcust=1-1-2275788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">via 9to5Mac</a>) claims the bezels will shrink to about 7mm, a reduction of about 20 percent. The same source also reported that the iPad Pro will get a new non-glossy nano-texture glass option like the Studio Display, which “scatters light to further minimize glare while delivering outstanding image quality in workspaces with bright light sources.” Apple charges an extra $300 for that option when buying a Studio Display.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Pro 2024 render with skinnier bezels\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The upcoming iPad Pro will reportedly have much skinnier bezels.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad Pro 2024 render with skinnier bezels\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The upcoming iPad Pro will reportedly have much skinnier bezels.</p></figcaption></figure><p>LeaksApplePro/X</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad Pro 2024 render with skinnier bezels\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ipad-pro-render-leak.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The upcoming iPad Pro will reportedly have much skinnier bezels.</p></figcaption></figure><p>LeaksApplePro/X</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>LeaksApplePro/X</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Likely contributing to the change is Apple’s expected move to OLED displays, which allows for smaller bezels due to the lack of backlighting. OLED displays emit their own light and individual pixels can be turned on and off, which eliminates light bleeding from the edges of screens and the need for bezels with a specific thickness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also evident in the image is a front camera on the wider landscape edge of the screen. Apple has long positioned the front camera on the short portrait edge of the iPad Pro, making it somewhat awkward for FaceTime calls and Face ID authentication when docked in landscape mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Pro has been rumored to be getting a new design, but Apple likely has some more changes in store as well. However, even with just smaller bezels, it represents the first noticeable design upgrade for the iPad Pro in five and a half years. The iPad Pro is expected to get several other upgrades, including an M3 processor, better cameras, and an upgraded Magic Keyboard. It may launch as early as next week and begin shipping in early- to mid-April.
