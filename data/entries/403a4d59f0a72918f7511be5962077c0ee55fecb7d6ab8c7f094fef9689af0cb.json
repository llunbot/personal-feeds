{"title":"AWS Week in Review – Updates on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, AWS Lambda, eksctl, Karpetner, and More – July 17, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-updates-on-amazon-fsx-for-netapp-ontap-aws-lambda-eksctl-karpetner-and-more-july-17-2023/","date":1689622596000,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-series-data-centered-eastern-oregon\">Data Centered: Eastern Oregon</a>, a five-part mini-documentary series looking at the real-life impact of the <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/committed-to-our-communities-the-economic-impact-of-awss-15-6-billion-investment-in-oregon\">more than $15 billion investment AWS has made in the local community</a>, and how the company supports jobs, generates economic growth, provides skills training and education, and unlocks opportunities for local businesses suppliers.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Last week, I watched a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-helped-me-learn-how-to-build-a-computer-from-scratch-heres-how-you-can-do-the-same\">new episode</a> introducing the <a href=\"https://www.bluecc.edu/academics/programs/data-center-technician\">Data Center Technician training program</a> offered by AWS to train people with little or no previous technical experience in the skills they need to work in data centers and other information technology (IT) roles. This video reminded me of my first days of cabling and transporting servers in data centers. Remember, there are still people behind cloud computing.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Last Week’s Launches</u></strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-fsx-for-netapp-ontap-now-supports-worm-protection-for-regulatory-compliance-and-ransomware-protection/\"><strong>Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP Updates</strong></a> – Jeff Barr introduced Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP support for <a href=\"https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/\">SnapLock</a>, an ONTAP feature that gives you the power to create volumes that provide write once read many (WORM) functionality for regulatory compliance and ransomware protection. In addition, FSx for NetApp ONTAP now supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/amazon-fsx-netapp-ontap-ipsec-encryption-data-transit/\">IPSec encryption</a> of data in transit and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/amazon-fsx-netapp-ontap-additional-monitoring-troubleshooting-capabilities/\">two additional monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities</a> that you can use to monitor file system events and diagnose network connectivity.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/aws-lambda-detects-recursive-loops-lambda-functions/\"><strong>AWS Lambda detects and stops recursive loops in Lambda functions</strong></a> – In certain scenarios, due to resource misconfiguration or code defects, a processed event might be sent back to the same service or resource that invoked the Lambda function. This can cause an unintended recursive loop and result in unintended usage and costs for customers. With this launch, Lambda will stop recursive invocations between Amazon SQS, Lambda, and Amazon SNS after 16 recursive calls. For more information, refer to our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-recursion.html\">documentation</a> or the launch <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/detecting-and-stopping-recursive-loops-in-aws-lambda-functions/\">blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2023/07/05/Email-notification.png\" alt=\"Email notification\" width=\"634\" height=\"514\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/amazon-cloudfront-3072-bit-rsa-certificates/\">Amazon CloudFront supports for 3072-bit RSA certificates</a></strong> – You can now associate their 3072-bit RSA certificates with CloudFront distributions to enhance communication security between clients and CloudFront edge locations. To get started, associate a 3072-bit RSA certificate with your CloudFront distribution using console or APIs. There are no additional fees associated with this feature. For more information, please refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-requirements.html#https-requirements-size-of-public-key\">CloudFront Developer Guide</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/aws-codebuild-github-actions/\"><strong>Running GitHub Actions with AWS CodeBuild</strong></a> – Two weeks ago, AWS CodeBuild started to support GitHub Actions. You can now define GitHub Actions steps directly in the BuildSpec and run them alongside CodeBuild commands. Last week, the AWS DevOps Blog published the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/running-github-actions-in-a-private-subnet-with-aws-codebuild/\">blog post</a> about using the <a href=\"https://github.com/liquibase-github-actions\">Liquibase GitHub Action</a> for deploying changes to an Amazon Aurora database in a private subnet. You can learn how to integrate AWS CodeBuild and nearly 20,000 GitHub Actions developed by the open source community.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2023/07/06/image005-2.png\" alt=\"CodeBuild configuration showing the GitHub repository URL\" width=\"1612\" height=\"1314\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/dynamodb-local-version-2-0/\"><strong>Amazon DynamoDB local version 2.0</strong></a> – You can develop and test applications by running <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html\">Amazon DynamoDB local</a> in your local development environment without incurring any additional costs. The new 2.0 version allows Java developers to use DynamoDB local to work with Spring Boot 3 and frameworks such as Spring Framework 6 and Micronaut Framework 4 to build modernized, simplified, and lightweight cloud-native applications.</p> \n<p>For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">What’s New at AWS</a> page.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Open Source Updates</u></strong><br /> Last week, we introduced new open source projects and significant roadmap contributions to the Jupyter community.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/weaveworks-and-aws-joining-forces-to-maintain-open-source-eksctl/\"><strong>New joint maintainership between Weaveworks and AWS for eksctl</strong></a> – Now the <code>eksctl</code> open source project has been moved from the Weaveworks GitHub organization to a new top level GitHub organization—<a href=\"https://github.com/eksctl-io\">eksctl-io</a>—that will be jointly maintained by Weaveworks and AWS moving forward. The <a href=\"https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl\">eksctl project</a> can now be found on GitHub.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/aws-karpenter-windows-containers/\"><strong>Karpenter now supports Windows containers</strong></a> – Karpenter is an open source flexible, high-performance Kubernetes node provisioning and management solution that you can use to quickly scale Amazon EKS clusters.
