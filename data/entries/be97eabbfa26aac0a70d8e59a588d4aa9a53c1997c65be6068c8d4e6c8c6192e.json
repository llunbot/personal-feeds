{"title":"Shhhh! A Quiet Place: Day One trailer is anything but quiet","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001640","date":1707334273000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>Lupita Nyong'o stars as Sam in <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>. </p></div>\n<p>The 2018 post-apocalyptic horror film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place\"><em>A Quiet Place</em></a> deservedly won critical raves and an Oscar for sound editing. Sound, and often the absence thereof, was used to build suspense and create extremely effective jump scares. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_Part_II\">2021 sequel</a> followed the same basic rules. So it's a bit jarring that the official trailer for the new spinoff film, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place:_Day_One\"><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em></a>, is rife with the sounds of New York City streets. It's written and directed by Michael Sarnoski, who co-wrote the original film with John Krasinski.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers below for the first two films.)</strong></p>\n<p>As I've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/start-the-new-year-right-with-terrifying-trailer-for-a-quiet-place-part-ii/\">written previously</a>, <em>A Quiet Place</em> had a simple premise: in early 2020, sightless extraterrestrial creatures wiped out most of the humans and animals on Earth. They hunt by sound thanks to their hypersensitive hearing and are difficult to kill because they sport tough armored skin. The film centered on the Abbott family, struggling to survive a few months after the initial invasion. Dad Lee (John Krasinski) was an engineer focused on keeping his family alive each day. Wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) was a doctor, pregnant with their fourth child.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001640#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001640&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be97eabbfa26aac0a70d8e59a588d4aa9a53c1997c65be6068c8d4e6c8c6192e","category":"Tech"}
