The code also suggests that the app will integrate with iCloud, with a web version on iCloud.com also a possibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app apparently taps into Apple's previously unused GroupKit daemon, which handles database models for groups of people. Little else is known about the app â€“ it could be standalone, or it could be an integration with existing apps. Whatever it is, the Invites app sounds like it will offer more event-related features than those found in Calendar, which currently manages event invites through a rather simplistic interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe beta code references reportedly first appeared in one of the iOS 18.2 betas, before being removed from the final release. Now they're back in iOS 18.3 beta 2, but that doesn't guarantee that Apple will release the app. The company could just be experimenting with an idea that is ultimately nixed from iOS 18.3, or Apple could decide to hold it over for a succeeding software update. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple seeded the second betas of iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 to developers on Tuesday for testing purposes. There are no new Apple Intelligence features in the updates, which will likely focus primarily on bugs and small software refinements. Additional Apple Intelligence functionality is coming in later iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/apple-working-on-new-invites-app/\">Apple Seemingly Working on New 'Invites' App to Manage Events</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seemingly-working-on-new-invites-app-to-manage-events.2447035/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa29489c8b4063df51a56166a50ab09ed51b562e1ec32f84d8c986fdec4cf3d5","category":"Apple"}
