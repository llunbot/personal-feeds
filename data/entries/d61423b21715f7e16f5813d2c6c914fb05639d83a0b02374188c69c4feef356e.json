Users can access Santa by tapping a snowflake icon next to the prompt bar or through voice settings. The feature works on iOS and Android mobile apps, chatgpt.com, and OpenAI's Windows and MacOS applications. The Santa voice option will remain available to users worldwide until early January.</p>\n<p>The conversations with Santa exist as temporary chats that won't save to chat history or affect the model's memory. OpenAI designed this limitation specifically for the holiday feature. Keep that in mind, because if you let your kids talk to Santa, the AI simulation won't remember what kids have told it during previous conversations.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-introduces-santa-mode-to-chatgpt-for-ho-ho-ho-voice-chats/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-introduces-santa-mode-to-chatgpt-for-ho-ho-ho-voice-chats/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d61423b21715f7e16f5813d2c6c914fb05639d83a0b02374188c69c4feef356e","category":"Tech"}
