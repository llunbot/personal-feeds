It's based on the bestselling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)\">role-playing gaming franchise</a> set in a satirical, 1950s-style future post-nuclear apocalypse. There's plenty for gaming fans to be pleased about, judging by the trailer, but casting national treasure Walton Goggins (<em>Justified</em>) as a gunslinging Ghoul was quite simply a stroke of genius.</p>\n<p>The first <em>Fallout</em> RPG was released in 1997, followed by several sequels and spinoffs. According to the game's lore, modern civilization is destroyed in 2077 by a global nuclear war between the US and China. Survivors live in various underground vaults (fallout shelters). Each iteration of the game takes place somewhere across a post-apocalyptic US metro area and features a Vault Dweller—someone born and raised underground—as the protagonist. The first game takes place in 2161 and features a Vault Dweller from Vault 13, deep in the mountains of Southern California. The Vault Dweller must complete various missions to save the residents of Vault 13, which takes said protagonist to in-world places like Junktown; a merchant city called the Hub; and Necropolis, filled with Ghouls, i.e., humans badly mutated by exposure to nuclear radiation. </p>\n<p>The series <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/amazons-fallout-tv-series-gets-a-2024-release-date/\">was announced</a> in July 2020, with <em>Westworld</em> writers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy serving as executive producers. In January 2022, it was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/amazons-fallout-tv-series-is-about-to-enter-production/\">revealed</a> that Nolan would direct the first three episodes but that two other writers—Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner—would be the showrunners. Todd Howard, who directed several games in the franchise, is also an executive producer <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/11/fallout-first-look\">and has said</a> the series is not an adaptation of any particular game, but it is set within the same continuity.
