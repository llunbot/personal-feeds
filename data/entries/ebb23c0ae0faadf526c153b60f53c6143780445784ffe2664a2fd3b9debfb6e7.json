Need a chain? Cassette? A suspension fork??? Ha ha, good luck with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Groupsets may be particularly hard to find, but it’s important to remember there are more options than just Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo. Are off-brands like Microshift truly diamonds in the rough, or is it yet another example of you-get-what-you-pay-for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nerds also chat about how the most recent Strava updates might help prevent bike thefts, an encouraging new way to buy refurbished cycling clothing, and the pros and cons of $30 socks. Last — but certainly not least! — we reveal the banging new jingle for our Ask a Mechanic segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/c74257e0-deda-49fc-b2ea-551819ac9483.gif\" />     SUBSCRIBE TO THE ‘NERD ALERT’ PODCAST</strong><br />Never miss an episode.
