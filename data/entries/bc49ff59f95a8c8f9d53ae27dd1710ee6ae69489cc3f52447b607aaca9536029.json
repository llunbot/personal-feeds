It's the type of horror story that rarely happens, yet once is enough to make you second-guess the smart home products you bring into your personal spaces forever.</p>\n<p>That's why I was so intrigued by Thursday's announcement of Matic. It's an upcoming robot vacuum and mop that has been in development for six years by ex-Google Nest engineers Mehul Nariyawala and Navneet Dalal. It stands out from other consumer options because of the privacy it offers. The device doesn't require a connection to the Internet or cloud and performs all processing on-device.</p>\n<h2>Cloud-free cleaning</h2>\n<p>All of the mapping Matic does occurs on the device's hardware, which Dalal told <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/mantics-robot-vacuum-maps-spaces-without-sending-data-to-the-cloud/?guccounter=1\">TechCrunch</a> has computing power comparable to that of an iPhone 6. Other robot vacuums can work without the cloud, but then their mapping features won't work.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980960#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980960&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc49ff59f95a8c8f9d53ae27dd1710ee6ae69489cc3f52447b607aaca9536029","category":"Tech"}
