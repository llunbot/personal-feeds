And while you may not think of earbuds and headphones as the types of products that would be updated with new features on a regular basis, Apple does a great job of integrating them into its ecosystem, and new versions bring more functionality. Here’s what we know about the next AirPods releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 AirPods: The latest rumors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 18:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/545298/apples-third-generation-airpods-are-finally-here.html\">Third-gen AirPods</a> arrived at Apple’s “Unleashed” event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>June 30:</strong> Ming-Chi Kuo reports (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/30/airpods-pro-2-to-debut-in-2022-kuo-says&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via AppleInsider</a>) that the <strong>second-gen AirPods Pro won’t arrive until 2022</strong>, a bit later than they were initially expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 AirPods Pro (2nd generation)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Availability: </strong>Apparently, Apple had planned on shipping the second-generation AirPods Pro this year, but Bloomberg <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> in May 2021 that it won’t ship until 2022. Ming-Chi Kuo<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/30/airpods-pro-2-to-debut-in-2022-kuo-says&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"> echoed that timeline</a> in a note to investors in late June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design:</strong> Bloomberg <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that the next AirPods Pro will not have any stems and could look a lot like the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348693/apple-takes-on-airpods-pro-with-150-beats-studio-buds-noise-canceling-earbuds.html\">Beats Studio Buds</a> that were recently unveiled, with a design that sits flush with the ear.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/beats-studio-buds.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>The next AirPods Pro could take design cues from the Beats Studio Buds.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Beats</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong> Apple will continue to differentiate the AirPods Pro with noise cancellation after the third-gen AirPods arrived without it. According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Bloomberg</a>, the next AirPods Pro will focus more on fitness tracking and have updated motion sensors as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> No reports of price have been made. The current model is $249, but they are frequently on sale. The new Beats Studio Buds are $150, so it’s possible Apple could do a small price reduction. Apple technically reduced the price of the 3rd-gen AirPods to $179 (the 2nd-gen model with the wireless charging case was $199) but eliminated the lower-cost option with the wired case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2022 AirPods Max</strong> (2nd generation)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max was released in late 2020, so it’s unlikely that a new model will launch until late 2022, based on Apple’s AirPods cadence. However, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">reported</a> in May that while Apple is not working on any design or feature updates, Apple could release new colors to refresh the product mid-cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 AirPods: Apple Music Lossless</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple launched Lossless Audio and Lossless High-Res Audio for Apple Music in June, but due to the limitations of Bluetooth and the AAC codec, none of the current AirPods are able to stream the higher-quality tracks. However, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://Looking%20for%20a%20few%20final%20deals%20during%20the%20last%20few%20hours%20of%20Prime%20Day?%20We&amp;#039;ve%20put%20together%20must-have%20bundles%20of%20our%20favorite%20discounted%20gear%20for%20Mac,%20iPhone,%20and%20iPad%20users.&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Jon Prosser reported</a> that Apple is working on a new audio codec that would allow lossless streaming over AirPods, which could get an introduction alongside the new models. It’s unclear whether such a new feature would be limited to new AirPods, but if Apple opts to use Wi-Fi and AirPlay 2 to enable Lossless audio, that would require new hardware. All AirPods models are able to enjoy Spatial Audio for music and video</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ae4a7b05f2214ec88a2e2d828fa7d1793a1f5f204234d25a0abc2a80e82dd1c1","category":"Apple"}
