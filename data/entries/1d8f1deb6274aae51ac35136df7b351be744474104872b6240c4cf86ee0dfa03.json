For 2024, the Specialized Factory Team was a winning mobile test lab, experimenting with new XC rim shapes, carbon/titanium spokes, and updated hub designs. As a result, the new Roval Control World Cup Wheels were designed directly with the Specialized Factory Racing Team athletes and the design team.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner.webp\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels Banner\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner.webp 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Banner-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Working cooperatively to get the wheelset as light as possible without sacrificing durability and handling, the new feather-weight wheels tip the scales at a scant 992g/pair <em>with</em> valves and tape.

The main differences would be the rim and hubset. The Roval SL Team Edition used the same Roval rim as others in the XC line; this new wheelset is another layup and design altogether. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4.webp\" alt=\"2025 Roval Control WC-4\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Roval-Control-WC-4-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did they Save the Weight? </strong>The new design reduces weight by over 250g compared to previous models.

Carbon spokes with titanium fittings are 1.7g lighter and 63% stronger than steel (weighing about 3g per spoke, including nipple), chopping a massive 101.6g while boosting overall strength and longevity.  After nine months of testing, spoke reinforcement, ply overlaps, and fiber angles were all fine-tuned, eliminating 18 plies and shedding another 36g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-logo--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How’s the Durability? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Light and “World Cup race ready” don’t scream longevity to the average consumer.

Optimized torsional stiffness allows the rim to flex with the terrain, keeping control high and fatigue low—something we’ve seen on rims like the new ENVE MTB line and Reserve wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels freehub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-freehub--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Updated Hubs and Spokes </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized says the new Roval LF hub (swapped out from the DT-240 straight-pulled design) and carbon spokes went through 25 iterations, all to dial in the perfect balance of acceleration, braking precision, and overall smoothness. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels internals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-internals--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no mention of hub internals, but based on the free hub design, it’s very close to the ones used on the Team Edition Wheels.

They narrowed the scope of their cross-county offerings slightly and looked to get as efficient as possible. To Specialized, a lean line means two tires, two treads, available in two casing designs to suit your cross-country needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels Air Trak logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-logo-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Air Trak – Maximum Speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Air Trak is a fast-looking tire. Its tread takes the fast-rolling tread cluster from the Renegade it replaces. It boasts a dual GRIPTON T5/T7 compound and Flex Lite casing. This tire is built to be the fastest off the line and through the turns on hardpack tracks. The updated tread design has strategically placed, and sized knobs shave 60g compared to the Renegade, which weighs in just 575g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the trails and races you frequent aren’t ski resort clean or super fast clay, don’t worry. The Air Trak comes available in two casing options; </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flex Lite: </strong>The ultimate lightweight XC casing for minimal weight and max speed. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Grid Lite: </strong>The same supple ride but with added protection against pinch flats and sidewall cuts, with additional weight.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels Air Trak side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Specialized Air Trak Details: </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Terrain: </strong>Hardpack</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Casing:</strong> 60TPI Flex Lite </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compound:</strong> GRIPTON T5 center strip, GRIPTON T7 shoulders</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Type: </strong>Tubeless</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Size Available: </strong>29 x 2.35</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>605g</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $65.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels on the trail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-trail--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Fast Trak: The Do-It-All XC Weapon</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fast Trak is standard when the course has varied terrain. Think wet roots, rocks, some damp sections—or you just want that extra push in corns. This tire offers control, speed, and lightweight performance. It’s a personal favorite of mine, and I’m excited to see this update. Specialized says it’s been refined to deliver the most well-rounded, high-performance XC tire you can ride, but we’ll judge that later. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels Mino knobs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, here are the updated tech details. The design team updated the tread slightly with Block-In-Block outer knobs for better predictable handling in mixed conditions. The compact center knobs have a GRIPTON T5 center strip to lower rolling resistance without sacrificing grip. It arrives in both Flex Lite or Grid Lite casings and 2.25″ and 2.35″ sizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> Mixed XC Terrain</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compound:</strong> GRIPTON T5 center strip, GRIPTON T7 shoulders</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Casing:</strong> 60TPI Flex Lite or Grid Lite with sidewall protection</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compound: </strong>GRIPTON® T5/T7</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> Tubeless</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Size &amp; Weight: </strong>29×2.2 Flex Lite – 605g, 29×2.35 Flex Lite – 615g, 29×2.2 Grid Lite – 676g, 29×2.35 Grid Lite – 690g</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $65</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels on the bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-on-the-bike--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Impressions: Roval Control World Cup Wheels and Updated XC tires</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roval Control World Cup Wheels arrived in a box similar to the Team Edition wheels but in a slightly less grand package.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-bags--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels arrive with a premium bag (each wheel arrives with its own bag), replacement spokes (each 304mm), and nipples in case of trail mishaps.

First off, the Roval Control World Cup Wheels felt excellent and balanced on the road, and the tires rolled very efficiently. The new tires have a nice round shape, no flattop over exposed side knobs. They felt perfectly paired with the Control World Cup Wheels, as they should. I inflated them to 18/19 PSI to start my journey and felt confident that this pressure would be OK for most of the riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels front hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>On the Bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My route to the trailhead is lumpy, riddled with quick climbs that come out of the blue. On these climbs, I could feel the springiness of the Control World Cup Wheels. The lightness adds another dimension to climbing (at least to me). They spin up fast and hold the speed over the terrain, like a nice mid-depth (30mm) road wheel. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels Air Trak\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the trails, everything clicked. The tires and the wheels (the fact that I haven’t been on the trails that much this season) all felt great. The first impression was, <em>“These are light,” </em>and then, <em>“These are fast.”</em> Of course, the first impression is the weight, but the second is the tires. The trails were frozen, with some ice and ruts. I could hook up on the trail and rumble over the ruts without feeling squirmy. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels top fast trak\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I mounted the Fast Trak on the front and the Air Trak on the rear, and it was the right move for the conditions. The Fast Trak could dig into the trail confidently when diving downhill, and the Air Trak had enough bite to claw up the frozen single track. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-full-rim--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-full-rim--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels full rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-full-rim--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-full-rim--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-full-rim--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-full-rim--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-full-rim--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-inner-rim--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-inner-rim--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels inner rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-inner-rim--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-inner-rim--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-inner-rim--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-inner-rim--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-inner-rim--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight of the wheels transfers to the overall feeling of the bike—the hopping, the wheeling over obstacles, the small vibration damping—everything. <em>But what do you expect from a $3,000 World Cup race-level wheelset? </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-ari-track-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-ari-track-weight--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Roval Control World Cup Wheels ari track weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-ari-track-weight--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-ari-track-weight--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-ari-track-weight--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-ari-track-weight--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-ari-track-weight--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fast-Trak-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fast-Trak-weight--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Fast Trak weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fast-Trak-weight--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fast-Trak-weight--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fast-Trak-weight--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fast-Trak-weight--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fast-Trak-weight--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m still feeling out of the Control World Cup Wheelset and the Fast/Air Trak combo, but I’m excited. The wheels will be a true asset to the race and performance-focused riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What about the price?</em> </strong>Well, it’s about $3/gram for the Control World Cup Wheels at $3,000 per set. Their closest production (big box) competitor is the Bontrager RSL (1200g) at $2,700 and the DT Swiss XRC 1200 (1,300g) at $2,900 for the set. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stay Tuned</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We plan on testing these this season with lots of racing (my hip willing), and we’ll report back soon. Until then, we can confidently say these wheels are light, fast, and expensive. But it could be worth it if you’re on a quest for a Stars and Stripes jersey or to build the ultimate XC race rig. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/cycling-gear/bike-parts/bike-wheels?page=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=US_Branded_Search_%20Wheels_ROI&amp;utm_id=21317042552&amp;utm_content=162464120359&amp;utm_term=roval%20wheels&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiArKW-BhAzEiwAZhWsICELTElWVIxxVajmhMyZ_mozKB3eUV7W0vQqI_hFIY-9YbUuRWhVuhoCuUsQAvD_BwE\">www.Specialized.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-roval-control-world-cup-wheelset-air-trak-xc-tire/\">Roval Releases 992g World Cup Wheelset and Updated XC Tires </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1d8f1deb6274aae51ac35136df7b351be744474104872b6240c4cf86ee0dfa03","category":"Cycling"}
