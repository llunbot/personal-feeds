According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 15 Pro models will support \"at least\" USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3. For comparison, the iPad Pro features a Thunderbolt port for transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps, while the entry-level iPad’s USB-C port is limited to just 480 Mbps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the higher-specification data transfer speed, iPhone 15 Pro models will therefore be able to transfer video and other file types much more quickly than the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>New iPhone 15 USB C Cable Info Confirmed <br />1.6M long<br />16Pins <br />Thicker and more resistant<br />USB 2.0 20V3A <br />No MFI <a href=\"https://t.co/WV4unodWPg\">pic.twitter.com/WV4unodWPg</a></p>— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1694463233183101216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nEach iPhone 15 will include a braided USB-C charging cable in the box that is thicker (i.e. more durable) and 50% longer than the Lightning cable that comes with current iPhone models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-longer/\">according to reports</a>.
