Lockdowns may be a thing of the past, but video calling still remains popular and is here to stay. And, of course, many of us are still working from home the majority of the time, continuing to use business-oriented apps such as Skype or Microsoft Teams to set up video calls with colleagues and clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro, all Macs have one of Apple’s FaceTime cameras already built in, so you don’t necessarily need to buy a new webcam for video calls. However, the webcams on older Macs offer embarrassingly low resolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an alternative to a webcam you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/817000/how-to-continuity-camera-iphone-webcam-for-your-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">use your iPhone as a Mac webcam</a> (Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/817000/how-to-continuity-camera-iphone-webcam-for-your-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">improved this functionality</a> in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-rumors-features-compatibility-release-date-beta.html\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 16</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678251/macos-13-update.html\" target=\"_blank\">macOS Ventura</a>) so we’ve included some products here that help make your iPhone into your main Mac webcam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Business users in particular will want to pick something better in order to project a more professional image to colleagues and clients, while many artists and musicians vlog and promote their work on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Almost all Mac owners could benefit from upgrading to something that can provide a sharper image than their machine’s default camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, here’s our guide to some of the best webcams for use with your Mac, complete with links to buy.

It’s more expensive than previous models, at $199.99/£219.99, but Logitech claims that it has a more sensitive camera – based on an 8.5MP Sony Starvis sensor for photography buffs – that provides an even sharper image. </p>\n\n<p>It also includes the inevitable AI features, including auto-light-correction designed to improve detail in low-light conditions and to focus the image directly on your face for improved visibility. We certainly couldn’t disagree with that, as the MX Brio produced a very sharp, detailed image that was particularly noticeable for its well-balanced and natural-looking light levels. The MX Brio can display 4K video at 30 frames per second, and that image quality will work well for video calls with clients or colleagues. You also have the ability to switch to 1080p resolution at 60fps to provide smooth motion for broadcasting, although this will depend on the camera controls that are provided by individual broadcasting or conferencing apps.</p>\n\n<p>The design of the camera is impressive too, with a sturdy aluminum body – available in pale or dark grey – and an adjustable stand that lets you attach it to your computer screen or sit it flat on a desk. You can also attach it to a standard ¼-inch tripod, and there’s a manual privacy shutter, along with two noise-reducing microphones. </p>\n\n<p>As always, Logitech provides better Mac support than most webcam manufacturers. You can plug the MX Brio into your Mac using its USB-C cable, and it will work automatically, like any other USB webcam. However, I already had Logitech’s Options+ app installed on my MacBook for testing the MX Keys S keyboard, and the app automatically recognized the MX Brio as soon as I plugged it in, and asked if I would like to download a software update. The Options+ app also includes additional controls, such as manual focus and exposure settings, and the ability to adjust brightness and contrast, color balance and saturation. You can save your own image presets as well, perhaps using different presets for business calls, presentations, or just chatting with friends.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

It doesn’t cut many corners, though, providing a bright sharp image that is clearer and more detailed than the 720p FaceTime camera on my aging office iMac. It provides 95-degree viewing angle, with fixed-focus to ensure that the entire image remains in focus at all times (which is handy if you need to move around during a presentation). </p>\n\n<p>The adjustable stand can rest on your desk or attach to your computer screen, and allows you to tilt and rotate the camera to get the right viewing angle. It includes twin microphones with noise-cancelling features to reduce background noise, and there’s a privacy shutter on the front of the camera too. The only thing to watch out for is that the W1050 uses an older USB-A interface—which is fine for my old iMac, but you’ll need an adaptor for newer Macs that only have USB-C.</p>\n\n<p>Like any USB webcam, the W1050 works automatically with Macs when connected via USB, but you will need Catalina (10.15.4) or later if you also want to use Kensington’s Konnect app. This provides additional controls for adjusting brightness, contrast and other settings, but its most useful feature is the ability to create and save profiles with settings that are suitable for different locations or lighting conditions. And, if you’re really serious about setting up a studio for video calls, conferencing or podcasting, then Kensington also has a range of accessories for use with its webcams, such as ring lights, and extendable mounts and stands.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

But, like most recent webcams, it now uses a USB-C interface, so you’ll need a spare USB-C port on your Mac in order to use it properly.</p>\n\n<p>Available in a variety of colors, and using almost 50% recycled plastic, the Brio provides 70-degree viewing angle, which is fine for simple head-and-shoulders shots when you’re making a video call. Along with 1,920×1,080 resolution, the Brio includes automatic light correction that is designed to cope with changing lighting conditions throughout the day, and a noise-reducing microphone that damps down background noise in case the kids are getting a bit rowdy while you’re talking to the boss. </p>\n\n<p>The image quality is certainly brighter and less grainy than the 720p webcam on my MacBook Pro – although, oddly, it seems to work better in low-light conditions with the auto-exposure option turned off.</p>\n\n<p>The adjustable stand can sit flat on your desk, or be attached to the top of a monitor, and the 5ft USB cable gives you plenty of room to move it around and get the right viewing angle. There’s also a privacy shutter on the camera for when you want to go offline. Most USB webcams work with Macs automatically, but may only provide limited control over the camera settings. However, Logitech is one of the few manufacturers that makes a Mac version of its Tune app, which allows Mac users to manually adjust settings such as contrast.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.

MagSafe iPhones (12/13/14) attach magnetically to the mount in either portrait or landscape orientation. The connection was strong, but we felt safe using the phone without va case, for the most secure magnetic clamp.</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone Mount with MagSafe for Mac laptops also features a ring grip for for handheld or kickstand usage. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.

It’s a shame that Razer’s Synapse app isn’t Mac-compatible—meaning you’ll be missing out on some current features and won’t be able to update it when new firmware arrives—but the Kiyo itself still works well as a standard USB webcam without needing any additional software and has a number of other useful features that will come in handy for video chats with friends and even for business calls.</p>\n\n<p>The Kiyo provides a nice sharp 1080p lens (1920×1080), with 81.6 degrees viewing angle, and can record video at 30fps, or capture still images at 2,688×1,520.</p>\n\n<p>The adjustable stand can clip to the top of a computer screen or fold flat to sit on your desk. You can tilt the camera lens to get just the right viewing angle, and the Kiyo’s USB cable is 1.5m long so that you can adjust the position freely. There’s also a tripod mount on the base of the stand as well—although you have to use your own tripod.</p>\n\n<p>Like many webcams, the Kiyo has an autofocus function so it can keep your picture nice and clear when you’re moving around, but the main feature that sets it apart is its built-in ‘lighting ring’. The circular outer rim that surrounds the camera lens lights up as soon as you select the Kiyo as a video source in your video apps, and you can turn the ring like a dial to adjust the brightness level up or down.

The original Kyio (above) is still available and has recently had a price cut, so that’s a good option if you just want an affordable 1080p upgrade. However, the latest model is the Kiyo Pro Ultra, which steps up to 4K resolution and includes a number of advanced features that are very much aimed at podcasting, streamers and other professional or semi-pro content creators.</p>\n\n<p>It’s usually $299.99/£299.99, but as well as providing 4K resolution, Razer claims that the Kiyo Pro Ultra uses the “largest sensor ever in a webcam”, which helps it to perform particularly well in low-light conditions. The webcam also includes auto-focus and auto-exposure features to quickly adjust the image quality, and it certainly worked well on a gloomy summer morning in London, producing a bright and sharply detailed image when used with my MacBook Pro. The webcam has a USB-C interface, but Razer also includes a USB-A cable for older PCs and Macs as well.</p>\n\n<p>Like all USB webcams, the Kiyo Pro Ultra works automatically when connected to a Mac, but Razer’s Synapse app is only available for Windows PCs, which means that Mac users won’t be able to use the additional controls and settings that are available in that app. You can still use it with third-party video apps, though, such as the popular open-source OBS (open broadcaster software), which is now available for Macs with both Intel and Apple Silicon processors (obsproject.com).</p>\n\n<p>Home users who just want a good webcam for simple video calls may be better off with a less expensive webcam that provides a native app for use with Macs. However, the Razor Kiyo Pro Ultra will still be a good choice for content creators who are already familiar with streaming apps such as OBS, and who are prepared to pay a bit extra for a really high-quality webcam.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7.

There’s also an impressive 94-degree field of view, which provides the user with a large canvas for cropping and zooming without noticeable loss in detail.</p>\n\n<p>That’s where the AverMedia CamEngine comes in. CamEngine is a vital utility and is essentially required to get the most out of the Cam 513—which doesn’t have drivers, you need to use their software. The software allows you to tweak the image using advanced features such as Snapchat-style filters and AI-powered camera cropping.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding those AI-related capabilities, it can crop in and track your face as you move around – good news if you move around a lot while on video calls. It’s not always flawless in performance, however – we found it sometimes cropped into something that vaguely looked like a face, but you’ve also got the option of manually setting up each crop for different shots and angles.</p>\n\n<p>Shots can be programmed to hotkeys, allowing for extreme zooms and dramatic ultra-wide shots on the fly during streams and video calls.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also find a privacy-focused shutter built in which will cover the webcam sensor when not in use.</p>\n\n<p>The adjustable stand will attach to most displays. The camera plugs into your Mac via USB-C—the cable isn’t built-in but we don’t think that is a disadvantage (it means you can replace it with a shorter or longer USB-C cable depending on how you want to set it up.)</p>\n\n<p>It’s a great 4K webcam—the only real annoyance is that we could hear a faint ticking noise coming from the webcam during use.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>What to look for in a Mac webcam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve picked out eight webcams worthy of recommendation above, but here’s some more general advice on what to look for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The FaceTime cameras included on all MacBook laptops and most iMac models are limited to just ‘720p’—which generally means a resolution of 1280×720 (although the FaceTime camera on my office iMac only seems to record at 1080×720). That’s pretty basic in these days of HD and 4K video, so in recent months many people have decided to upgrade to a higher-quality webcam that supports HD resolution of 1920×1080, or even one of the latest 4K webcams.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Useful features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as providing a sharper, high-resolution video image, other useful features to look out for when buying a new webcam include autofocus, which can keep the image clear and sharp even if you need to move around a little, and brightness adjustment for when gloomier days. A wide-angle lens can be useful too, allowing you to fit more than one person into the image, or allowing business users to step back from the camera while giving a presentation or using a whiteboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Framerates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also check to make sure that the webcam can record smooth video with a framerate of 25 or 30 frames per second (fps). Some webcams can even record at 60fps, although that’s mainly for specialist tasks such as gaming and e-sports on Twitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Connection standards</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s certainly plenty of choice these days, and most modern webcams will work with your Mac automatically as they just use a standard USB connection—generally USB 3.0, although USB-C is now starting to appear on some new webcams too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once it’s plugged in, a USB webcam should then be able to work with any suitable video software on your Mac, such as FaceTime, Zoom or Skype (although it’s a shame that Apple never got around to releasing a Windows version of FaceTime, as that puts it at a real disadvantage against its video-chat rivals). The webcam’s microphone will also appear as an audio input in the Sounds control panel in System Preferences on your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some manufacturers also provide their own apps with their webcams, which can help with features such as brightness and autofocus, so it’s worth checking to see if the webcam provides its own Mac app as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to improve lighting for Zoom, Google Meet and Teams calls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best webcams can shine some light on your face to improve lighting, but depending on your room environment and natural/artificial light sources even the greatest webcam will struggle to show you in the, ahem, best light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some video-conferencing apps include a low-light feature that will automatically lighten your appearance. Zoom’s is called “Adjust for low light”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to ensure that there is light is in front of you to properly illuminate your face and appear naturally well-lit.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Ring lights to improve Zoom calls lighting\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=300%2C135&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=768%2C345&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=1200%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=1536%2C690&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"539\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Ring lights to improve Zoom calls lighting\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=300%2C135&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=768%2C345&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=1200%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=1536%2C690&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"539\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Amazon</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Ring lights to improve Zoom calls lighting\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=300%2C135&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=768%2C345&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=1200%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lights-to-improve-Zoom-calls.jpg?resize=1536%2C690&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"539\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Amazon</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just pointing a bright desk lamp at your face could overwhelm your webcam and make you look like your are facing the a bright star.
