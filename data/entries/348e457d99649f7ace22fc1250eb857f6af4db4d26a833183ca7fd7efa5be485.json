This move\nresponded to longstanding <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/10/1/tyad020/7590463\">expert consensus</a>, and a global coalition\nof hundreds of preeminent computer security experts who patiently\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Aeex72MtFBjKhExRTooVMWN9TC-pbH-5LEaAbMF91Y/edit\">weighed in</a> to explain the serious dangers of the approaches on the\ntable — approaches that aimed to subject everyone’s private\ncommunications to mass scanning against a government-curated\ndatabase or AI model of “acceptable” speech and content.</p>\n\n<p>There is no way to implement such proposals in the context of\nend-to-end encrypted communications without fundamentally\nundermining encryption and creating a dangerous vulnerability in\ncore infrastructure that would have global implications well\nbeyond Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of accepting this fundamental mathematical reality, some\nEuropean countries continue to play rhetorical games. They’ve come\nback to the table with the same idea under a new label. Instead of\nusing the previous term “client-side scanning,” they’ve rebranded\nand are now calling it “upload moderation.” Some are claiming that\n“upload moderation” does not undermine encryption because it\nhappens before your message or video is encrypted. This is untrue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but it’s a great idea to let these same EU bureaucrats design how mobile software distribution should work.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/19/signal-eu-encryption-upload-moderation\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"348e457d99649f7ace22fc1250eb857f6af4db4d26a833183ca7fd7efa5be485","category":"Tech"}
