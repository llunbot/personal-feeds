Family co-founded speaker company Syng alongside former Apple design team member Christoper Stringer. Syng is known for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/christopher-stringer-syng-cell-alpha-speaker/\">super expensive Cell Alpha</a>, which boasts \"triphonic\" audio technology that's able to create an immersive, dynamic sound field.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has struggled to get the ‌HomePod‌ to catch on since its launch in 2018. The initial version of the speaker was priced at $350 and boasted higher-quality audio than competitors, but it was just not as popular as much more affordable smart speaker options from Samsung and Google.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe original ‌HomePod‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">was discontinued</a> earlier this year with Apple instead opting to focus on the $99 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, which is smaller and much more appealing due to its lower price tag.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoing forward, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/\">plans to create</a> a combined ‌HomePod‌, ‌Apple TV‌, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> device that will serve as an all-in-one entertainment option. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, such a device could be released as early as 2023.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/14/apple-new-audio-software-lead-homepod/\">Apple Aims to Boost HomePod Sales With New Audio Software Lead</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-aims-to-boost-homepod-sales-with-new-audio-software-lead.2316975/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Zyw9uCsgR0k:Tb936BvBv9I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Zyw9uCsgR0k:Tb936BvBv9I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Zyw9uCsgR0k\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7becf372fd0f4eece348e8658de844b2ad6790131fc7d25ee869a8be0d68e593","category":"Apple"}
