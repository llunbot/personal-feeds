may have noticed more riders than ever are adopting extreme cockpit setups.</p>\n<p>While much of the talk at this year’s race has been of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/why-was-1x-used-2023-tour-de-france/\">1x drivetrains</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-tyre-tech/\">wide tubeless tyres</a> and riders switching to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2023-tour-de-france-bike-weights/\">(slightly) lighter bikes</a>, it’s easy to overlook the changing nature of pro front ends.</p>\n<p>Pro riders are often cited as being fairly conservative when it comes to new bike tech, but preferences on handlebar widths appear to have shifted rapidly in recent years.</p>\n<p>So, with the dust settling on another <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France</a>, let’s take a look at the front-end setups of some of the biggest names in the bunch, and consider what they might tell us about where things are heading with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">road handlebars</a>.</p>\n<h2>Have the pros been reading my articles?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a road bike with narrow handlebars\" title=\"RussellBurton_20210628_2DX2404\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Simon has filled many column inches with his thoughts on narrow handlebars.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Given the frequency and volume with which I’ve evangelised about the benefits of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/narrow-handlebars/\">narrow handlebars</a>, it’s tempting to wonder if the pros have been frequenting leading multi-discipline cycling website BikeRadar in recent years.</p>\n<p>While I hope they have, it’s more likely they’ve instead been paying attention to the growing number of performance engineers and consultants many pro teams now employ.</p>\n<p>The likes of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/dan-bigham-hour-record-pinarello/\">Dan Bigham</a> (performance engineer at Team Ineos-Grenadiers), <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-tech-israel-premiertech/\">Dr Ciarán O’Grady</a> (performance coach at Israel-PremierTech) and Casper von Folsach (performance coach at Team Uno-X), for example, are tasked with helping riders be as fast as possible on the bike.</p>\n<p>Typically, these roles encompass overseeing a broad spectrum of rider performance, from training, recovery and nutrition, through to optimising equipment and working with team sponsors to develop new products.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Brands work closely with pro teams and riders to develop new equipment and bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With narrow handlebars having become mainstream in track cycling in recent years (they were <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tokyo-2020-olympic-track-cycling-tech/\">a key trend at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics</a>, for example), it’s no surprise to see the likes of Bigham and Folsach – both of whom were previously involved with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/danish-track-team-shin-tape-update/\">Danish Olympic track cycling team</a> – bringing these ideas into road racing.</p>\n<p>While the demands of road racing are undoubtedly different from those of track racing, the desire to ride as fast as possible crosses over neatly, after all.</p>\n<p>And with experts such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/drxavierdisley/\">Dr Xavier Disley</a> of AeroCoach saying the savings amount to around 2 watts per 10mm narrower you go (according to his testing at 45kph), it’s clear there were some easy gains available for many riders.</p>\n<h2>Cockpit setups at the 2023 Tour de France</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long and narrow cockpits were a clear trend among the top riders at this year’s race.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Just as with<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-2022-tech-trends/\"> last year’s race</a>, there appears to have been a clear trend towards long and narrow cockpit setups within the pro peloton.</p>\n<p>In fact, the most common handlebar widths we saw were 36cm and 38cm.</p>\n<p>There didn’t appear to be a correlation between rider height and bar width, either, as we see with bikes sold to consumers (where bar width typically increases according to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/bike-sizes/\">frame size</a>).</p>\n<h3>Narrow bars dominate</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"36cm handlebar on Ben

sported a 36cm handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>AG2R-Citroen’s 1.88m-tall GC rider, Ben O’Connor, for example had a 36cm-wide handlebar paired with a 140mm stem on his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/prototype-bmc-aero-bike/\">prototype BMC aero bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Alexis Renard, of Cofidis, also relatively tall at 1.84m, was using a 38cm-wide handlebar paired with a 140mm stem on his new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/alexis-renards-look-795-blade-rs/\">Look 795 Blade RS</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img

of the star names at this year’s race don’t appear to mind the potential trade-off.</p>\n<p>Yellow jersey winner, Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo–Visma), and his great rival Tadej Pogačar (UAE–Team Emirates), had 38cm-wide and 36cm-wide handlebars on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/vingegaard-cervelo-s5-versus-pogacar-colnago-v4rs/\">their respective bikes</a>, for example.</p>\n<p><a

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/bike-fit-explained-what-is-a-bike-fit-and-should-you-get-one/\">bike fit</a> tricky and/or expensive for everyday riders.</p>\n<p>With a range of

abandoned, the question remains – have we reached peak narrow handlebars?</p>\n<p>Given quite a few riders were running 36cm-wide bars at this year’s race, it might be tempting to conclude that we’re nearly there.</p>\n<p>After all, that’s only 1cm off the recently mandated, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/2023-uci-rule-changes/\">UCI minimum handlebar width of 35cm</a> for road racing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tour de France 2023 handlebar tech\" title=\"Tour de France 2023 handlebar tech\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some handlebars at the Tour pushed up against the UCI’s minimum width.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>However, as we noted at the time of the rule’s introduction, this regulation leaves room for brands and riders to push the envelope even further.</p>\n<p>A handlebar needs only to be 35cm wide outside-to-outside, which leaves the possibility to have a flared handlebar with 35cm-wide drops, but a much narrower position at the brake hoods.</p>\n<p>Notably, a few brands are already taking advantage of this.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

more standard options.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AeroCoach Ornix Handlebar\" title=\"AeroCoach Ornix Handlebar\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> AeroCoach’s Ornix

save a rider 4.7 watts versus <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/enves-angled-in-aero-road-bar-now-di2-integrated/\">ENVE’s SES aero handlebar</a> (in its narrowest 35cm width), when riding at 45kph, and an enormous 21.4 watts compared to a standard, round 42cm-wide handlebar.</p>\n<p>Of course, sponsorship restrictions, as well as the fact that some pro bikes (such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/canyon-aeroad-cfr-di2-review/\">Canyon Aeroad CFR</a>) simply aren’t compatible with third-party handlebars, mean we might not see this exact handlebar used at the Tour anytime soon.</p>\n<p>We wouldn’t be surprised if the big manufacturers take inspiration from progressive designs such as this one, though, especially if their sponsored teams are requesting similar designs.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jasper Stuyven's Trek Madone SLR\" title=\"Jasper Stuyven's Trek Madone SLR\"

aero road bike, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/tadej-pogacar-enve-handlebar-tour-de-france/\">ENVE confirmed its new integrated handlebar</a> was designed with input from Pogačar
