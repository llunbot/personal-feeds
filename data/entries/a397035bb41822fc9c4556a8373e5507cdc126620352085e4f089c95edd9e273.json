The 5.34-petaflop supercomputer ranked as the <a href=\"https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne\">20th most powerful</a> in the world at the time of its installation in 2016. Bidding started at $2,500, but it's price is currently $27,643 with the reserve not yet met.</p>\n\n<p>The supercomputer, which officially operated between January 12, 2017, and December 31, 2023, at the <a href=\"https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-wyoming-supercomputing-center\">NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center</a>, was a powerful (and once considered energy-efficient) system that significantly advanced atmospheric and Earth system sciences research.</p>\n<p>\"In its lifetime, Cheyenne delivered over 7 billion core-hours, served over 4,400 users, and supported nearly 1,300 NSF awards,\" writes the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) on its official Cheyenne <a href=\"https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne\">information page</a>. \"It played a key role in education, supporting more than 80 university courses and training events. Nearly 1,000 projects were awarded for early-career graduate students and postdocs. Perhaps most tellingly, Cheyenne-powered research generated over 4,500 peer-review publications, dissertations and theses, and other works.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020861#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020861&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a397035bb41822fc9c4556a8373e5507cdc126620352085e4f089c95edd9e273","category":"Tech"}
