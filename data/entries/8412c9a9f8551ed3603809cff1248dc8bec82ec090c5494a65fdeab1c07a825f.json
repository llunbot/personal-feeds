T-Mobile was offering a mobile service for people age 55 and over, with an \"Un-contract\" guarantee that it would never raise prices.</p>\n<p>\"I thought, wow, I can live out my days with this fixed plan,\" Odean, a Rhode Island resident who is now 70 years old, told Ars last week. Odean and her husband switched from Verizon to get the T-Mobile deal, which cost $60 a month for two lines.</p>\n<p>Despite its Un-contract promise, T-Mobile in May 2024 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/\">announced</a> a price hike for customers like Odean who thought they had a lifetime price guarantee on plans such as T-Mobile One, Magenta, and Simple Choice. The $5-per-line price hike will raise her and her husband's monthly bill from $60 to $70, Odean said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033962#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033962&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8412c9a9f8551ed3603809cff1248dc8bec82ec090c5494a65fdeab1c07a825f","category":"Tech"}
