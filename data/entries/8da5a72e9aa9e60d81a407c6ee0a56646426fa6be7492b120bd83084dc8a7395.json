Capturing the details of hand movement can provide a more intuitive and vivid human-machine UI (for example, detecting the user's hand from a clenched fist to open and the balloon [image] in hand flying away).\r\n<br />\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\nKuo describes the ability for the headset to detect both hand gestures and movements to provide the user with an immersive experience where the user could open their hand to let go of a virtual balloon. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to accomplish this impressive feat, Apple is expected to incorporate four sets of 3D sensors which are of higher quality and specifications than the current iPhones.  Kuo sees the quality of this human-machine user interface as the key to the success of Apple's upcoming AR headset. According to Kuo, these interface abilities include gesture control, object detection, as well as eye tracking, iris recognition, voice control, skin detection, expression detection, and spatial detection.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/04/apple-reveals-more-about-mixed-reality-headset-guis-how-to-control-menus-with-eye-tracking-in-air-micro-gesturing.html\">Patently Apple</a> pointed out a patent application from Apple which details this same concept. <blockquote> Different movements and locations of the micro-gestures and various movement parameters are used to determine the operations that are performed in the three-dimensional environment. Using the cameras to capture the micro-gestures to interact with the three-dimensional environment allow the user to freely move about the physical environment without be encumbered by physical input equipment, which allows the user to explore the three-dimensional environment more naturally and efficiently.\r\n<br />\r\n</blockquote>That patient is titled \"Devices, Methods, and Graphical User Interfaces for Interacting with Three-Dimensional Environments\".<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-ar-vr-hand-gesture-interface/\">Apple AR Glasses to Offer an Advanced Hand Gesture User Interface and Object Detection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ar-glasses-to-offer-an-advanced-hand-gesture-user-interface-and-object-detection.2326773/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QTg68gphG6s:dCuClHUBk3E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QTg68gphG6s:dCuClHUBk3E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8da5a72e9aa9e60d81a407c6ee0a56646426fa6be7492b120bd83084dc8a7395","category":"Apple"}
