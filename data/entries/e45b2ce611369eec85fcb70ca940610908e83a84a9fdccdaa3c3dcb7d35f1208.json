Again, there’s a new route promised specifically for the event, as well as racing along the existing Coastal Causeway in Watopia. Alongside the racing, there’s a community event, which Zwift says may lead to the Epic event being the largest-ever cycling e-sports event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there’s the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/whats-it-like-to-ride-a-hill-climb\" target=\"_blank\">Hill Climb</a> Championship, which will take on the Alpe du Zwift. Again, there’s a community challenge event running alongside the main competition, with different Zwift climbs if you don’t want to take on the Alpe. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More details in December</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/07112038/zwift_esports-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"zwift_esports\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/07112038/zwift_esports-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/07112038/zwift_esports-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/07112038/zwift_esports-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/07112038/zwift_esports-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/07112038/zwift_esports.jpg 1000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Games qualification races will take place in February, with the Elite Finals in the first two weeks of March 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the open competition, Zwift will also host exhibition races, which it says will showcase the latest innovations in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/racing-on-zwift-turbo-training-as-computer-game\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift racing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for more details of the competition, the community events, global broadcasting and how much the prizes are worth to the winners, you’ll need to wait until next month when Zwift will unveil more.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zwift-games-2024\">Zwift teases its ‘largest ever’ Zwift Games in 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e45b2ce611369eec85fcb70ca940610908e83a84a9fdccdaa3c3dcb7d35f1208","category":"Cycling"}
