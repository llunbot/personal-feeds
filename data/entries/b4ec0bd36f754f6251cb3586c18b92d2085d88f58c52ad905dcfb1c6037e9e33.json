People with even minimal access to such a network—say a paying customer, a low-level employee, or an attacker who has already gained limited entry—can exploit the vulnerabilities to infect connected devices with a malicious UEFI.</p>\n<p>Short for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</a>, UEFI is the low-level and complex chain of firmware responsible for booting up virtually every modern computer. By installing malicious firmware that runs prior to the loading of a main OS, UEFI infections can’t be detected or removed using standard endpoint protections. They also give unusually broad control of the infected device.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996543#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996543&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4ec0bd36f754f6251cb3586c18b92d2085d88f58c52ad905dcfb1c6037e9e33","category":"Tech"}
