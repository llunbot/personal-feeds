href=\"https://itrade.gov.il/hongkong/2022/07/12/israel-is-in-the-front-line-of-the-cloud-computing-era/\">Israel Ministry of Economic Industry</a>, Israel is in the front line of the cloud computing era and “is known to be the ‘start-up nation’ of the number of global start-ups being produced. Over the past decade, Israel has produced over 2,000 start-ups, the majority of these start-ups are driven by software as a service (SaaS). Israeli cloud technology remains a strong promise in the market as new start-ups are continuously penetrating the market.”</p> \n<p>AWS began supporting startups in Israel in 2013 through its <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/activate/\">AWS Activate</a> program. In Israel, AWS works with accelerator organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.eisp.org.il/\">8200 EISP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.f2vc.com/\">F2 Venture Capital</a> – <a href=\"https://www.f2vc.com/thejunction\">thejunction</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/tel-aviv\">TechStars</a> as well as venture capital firms like <a href=\"https://entreecap.com/\">Entrée Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/\">Bessemer Venture Partners</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pitango.com/\">Pitango</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vertexventures.co.il/\">Vertex Ventures Israel</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.viola-group.com/\">Viola Group</a> to support the rapid growth of their portfolio companies.</p> \n<p>Back in 2014, we opened an AWS office and a research and development (R&amp;D) center in Israel. Since then, Amazon has expanded its R&amp;D presence in the country, which now includes <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/prime-air\">Prime Air</a> and <a href=\"https://jobs-us-east.amazon.com/en/business_categories/alexa-and-amazon-devices\">Alexa Shopping</a>.</p> \n<p>In 2015, AWS acquired <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/annapurna%20labs\">Annapurna Labs</a>, an Israeli microelectronics company, which has developed advanced compute, networking, security, and storage technologies for AWS—such as AWS-designed <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/\">Graviton processors</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/\">AWS Inferentia</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/\">AWS Trainium</a> chips, and the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a>.</p> \n<p>In 2018, we <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/press-lounge/amazon-launches-its-new-tel-aviv-office-and-floor28\">expanded to new offices in Tel Aviv</a>, including <a href=\"https://aws-experience.com/emea/tel-aviv/\">AWS Experience Tel Aviv on Floor28</a> to support the growth of Israeli startups, enterprises, and government customers through technology-focused events and educational activities. Now, AWS Experience Tel Aviv on Floor28 is an education hub where anyone interested in AWS can attend industry events, workshops, and meetups, and receive free, in-person technical and business guidance from AWS experts.</p> \n<p>In 2019, we launched the first AWS infrastructure in Israel, opening an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront\">Amazon CloudFront</a> edge location. In 2020, we brought <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/outposts\">AWS Outposts</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\">AWS Direct Connect</a> to Israel, providing Israeli organizations with the ability to run AWS technology in their own data centers and establish dedicated connections back to the AWS Cloud.</p> \n<p>In April 2021, the government of Israel announced that it had selected AWS as its primary cloud provider as part of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/contract-center/aws-nimbus/\">Nimbus contract</a>. The Nimbus framework will enable government departments—including the ministries, education, healthcare, and municipalities—to accelerate their digital transformation by using AWS technologies.</p> \n<p>AWS continues to invest in upskilling local developers, students, and the next generation of IT leaders in Israel through programs such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/\">AWS Educate</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/\">AWS Academy</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/\">AWS re/Start</a>, and other <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/\">Training and Certification</a> programs.</p> \n<p>AWS Educate and Academy programs are providing free resources to accelerate cloud-related learning and preparing today’s students in Israel for the jobs of the future. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/member-list/#israel\">Israel colleges</a> already participating in the AWS Academy program include the Bar Ilan University, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Holon Institute of Technology, Jerusalem College of Technology, and University of Haifa. We also launched AWS re/Start to focus on helping unemployed or underemployed individuals to launch a new cloud career. You can now apply to AWS re/Start programs through <a href=\"https://www.aws.appleseeds.org.il/\">Appleseeds</a>, <a href=\"https://sigmalabs-jrs.tech/aws-courses/\">Sigma Labs Jerusalem</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.analiza.org.il/aws-restart-details\">Analiza Cyber Intelligence</a> in Israel.</p> \n<p><strong><u>AWS Customers in Israel</u></strong><br /> We have many amazing customers in Israel who are doing incredible things with AWS, for example:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/AI21-case-study-p4d/\"><strong>AI21 Labs</strong></a> – AI21 Labs offers access to its state-of-the-art proprietary language models through AI21 Studio for businesses to build their own generative artificial intelligence applications, as well as its consumer product, <a href=\"https://www.wordtune.com/\">Wordtune</a>, the first AI-based writing assistant to understand context and meaning. AI21 Labs scaled to hundreds of GPUs efficiently and cost effectively to build the <a href=\"https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j2\">Jurassic-2</a> family of language models. These models were trained with distributed and parallelized infrastructure based on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/\">Amazon EC2 P4d instances</a> 400 Gbps high-performance networking supported by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/\">Elastic Fabric Adaptor (EFA)</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/bankleumi-eksa-case-study/\"><strong>Bank Leumi</strong></a> – Leumi is one of the leading banks in Israel and has over 200 branches across the country and dedicated teams using AWS to build an advanced banking services marketplace.
