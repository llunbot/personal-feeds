That’s why they developed their new Black Gravel Dropper with 125mm travel, 27.2 diameter, remote actuator, and cable kit included. These sleek and minimal droppers retail for $479.95 and are in stock now at <a href=\"https://www.bikethomson.com/product/black-gravel-dropper/\" target=\"_blank\">Thomson</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d96f9c65ff4fd1793e0f00cc8dc3bdc98b595baca8962c491582811e171e6c8e","category":"Cycling"}
