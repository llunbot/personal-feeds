Sales of the device were lackluster and Snap stopped all plans for further work on the device after a four month period. Still, Snap sold 71,000 of the devices, but now it's <a href=\"https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us\">recalling all of them</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/pixy-drone-snapchat.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058119/snap-recall-pixy-drone-refund\">The Verge</a></em>, the batteries in the Pixy are a fire hazard and Snap has <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/Snap-Recalls-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Sold-for-Pixy-Flying-Cameras-Due-to-Fire-Hazard\">issued a recall</a> in partnership with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Pixy's battery can overheat, and there have been four reports of battery issues. One incident resulted in a minor battery fire, and a second resulted in a minor injury.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Pixy was sold on Snapchat's Pixy website and on Amazon between May 2022 and December 2023, with prices ranging from $185 to $250. Snap also sold extra batteries for $16 to $20.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the recall notice, customers who purchased a Pixy Flying Camera should remove the battery and stop charging it. Snap is providing refunds for all customers who bought a Pixy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo get a refund, customers will need to <a href=\"https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us\">visit the Pixy support site</a> and follow the instructions. Pixy cameras must be returned to Snap, and batteries must be safely disposed of.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/snap/\">Snap</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/snap-recalling-pixy-drones/\">Snap Recalling and Refunding All Pixy Drones Due to Fire Risk</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/snap-recalling-and-refunding-all-pixy-drones-due-to-fire-risk.2418075/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51fdfb2030f53683ca4ae1a46e98c63203cd4dd508b9f11a99dd1e2841017f95","category":"Apple"}
