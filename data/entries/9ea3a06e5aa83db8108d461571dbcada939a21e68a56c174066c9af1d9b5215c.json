However, the growth in demand for GPU capacity has outpaced industry-wide supply, making GPUs a scarce resource and increasing the cost of securing them.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> grows, we work hard to lower our costs so that we can pass those savings back to our customers. Regular <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/price-reduction/\">price reductions on AWS services</a> have been a standard way for AWS to pass on the economic efficiencies gained from our scale back to our customers.</p> \n<p>Today, we’re announcing up to 45 percent price reduction for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) </a>NVIDIA GPU-accelerated instances: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/\">P4</a> (P4d and P4de) and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p5/\">P5</a> (P5 and P5en) instance types. This price reduction to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/\">On-Demand</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/\">Savings Plan</a> pricing applies to all Regions where these instances are available. The pricing reduction applies to On-Demand purchases beginning June 1 and to Savings Plan purchases effective after June 4.</p> \n<p>Here is a table of price reductions percentage (%) from May 31, 2025 baseline prices by instance types and pricing plans:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance type</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>NVIDIA </strong><strong>GPUs</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>On-Demand</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EC2 Instance Savings Plans</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Compute Savings Plans<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>1 year</td> \n   <td>3 years</td> \n   <td>1 year</td> \n   <td>3 years</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>P4d</td> \n   <td>A100</td> \n   <td>33%</td> \n   <td>31%</td> \n   <td>25%</td> \n   <td>31%</td> \n   <td>–</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>P4de</td> \n   <td>A100</td> \n   <td>33%</td> \n   <td>31%</td> \n   <td>25%</td> \n   <td>31%</td> \n   <td>–</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>P5</td> \n   <td>H100</td> \n   <td>44%</td> \n   <td>–</td> \n   <td>45%</td> \n   <td>44%</td> \n   <td>25%</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>P5en</td> \n   <td>H200</td> \n   <td>25%</td> \n   <td>–</td> \n   <td>26%</td> \n   <td>25%</td> \n   <td>–</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offer low prices on compute usage, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1- or 3- year term. We offers two types of Savings Plans:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/compute-pricing/\">EC2 Instance Savings Plans</a> provide the lowest prices, offering savings in exchange for commitment to usage of individual instance families in a Region (for example, P5 usage in the US (N. Virginia) Region).</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/compute-pricing/\">Compute Savings Plans</a> provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs regardless of instance family, size, Availability Zones, and Regions (for example, from P4d to P5en instances, shift a workload between US Regions).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To provide increased accessibility to reduced pricing, we are making at-scale On-Demand capacity available for:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>P4d instances in the Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Canada (Central), and Europe (London) Regions</li> \n <li>P4de instances in the US East (N. Virginia) Region</li> \n <li>P5 instances in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), and South America (São Paulo) Regions</li> \n <li>P5en instances in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Regions</li> \n</ul> \n<p>We are also now delivering <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p6/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon EC2 P6-B200 instances</a> through Savings Plan to support large scale deployments, which <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-p6-b200-instances-powered-by-nvidia-blackwell-gpus-to-accelerate-ai-innovations/\" target=\"_blank\">became available</a> on May 15, 2025 at launch only through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/capacityblocks/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\" target=\"_blank\">EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML</a>. EC2 P6-B200 instances, powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, accelerate a broad range of GPU-enabled workloads but are especially well-suited for large-scale distributed AI training and inferencing.</p> \n<p>These pricing updates reflect the AWS commitment to making advanced GPU computing more accessible while passing cost savings directly to customers.</p> \n<p>Give Amazon EC2 NVIDIA GPU-accelerated instances a try in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon EC2 console</a>.
