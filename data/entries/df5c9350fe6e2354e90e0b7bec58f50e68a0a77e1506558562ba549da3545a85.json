Doing so is supposed to lead to better aerodynamic efficiency, reduced hip flexion, improvement of power balance, or being able to maintain a higher cadence over longer durations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has led brands like 5DEV to develop shorter cranks, like their new 155mm and 165mm crank arm lengths for Road, Gravel, and XC.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-first-pic-e1742501764315.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-first-pic-e1742501764315.webp\" alt=\"5DEV New Sizes for Titanium Cranks first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-first-pic-e1742501764315.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-first-pic-e1742501764315-297x132.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-first-pic-e1742501764315-120x53.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-first-pic-e1742501764315-768x342.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / 5DEV)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all of 5DEV’s products, these new cranks are designed and manufactured in their San Diego, California HQ. 5DEV uses a combination of cutting-edge engineering, precision CNC machining, and robotic laser welding. They are crafted using hollow, laser-welded titanium, and finished on a 5-axis CNC machine. They weigh in at a claimed 460g (165mm with the 118mm road spindle)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cranks are now available in 155mm, 160mm, 165mm, 170mm, and 175mm lengths. The spindle options are 118mm, 122mm WIDE, 130mm Boost, and 136 DUB Wide 55mm Chainline for customizable Q-Factor, and compatibility with various drivetrains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new cranks use SRAM 8 Bolt Interface making them compatible with Quarq Power Meters and SRAM 1x and 2X chainrings. They also integrate with the Quarq DFour DUB Power Meter for Shimano 2x, along with 5DEV’s custom 8-Bolt Spider for Shimano Dura-Ace rings. Also, 5DEV’s new 42T and 52T Aero chainrings can be used. And, 5DEV has a new Shimano GRX spider that will be launching in late Spring 2025 (maybe we’ll see it at Sea Otter).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5DEV Ti Cranks Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-black-e1742501791609.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"736\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-black-e1742501791609.webp\" alt=\"5DEV New Sizes for Titanium Cranks black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-black-e1742501791609.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-black-e1742501791609-297x182.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-black-e1742501791609-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5DEV-New-Sizes-for-Titanium-Cranks-black-e1742501791609-768x471.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $1,199 (raw titanium), $1,299 (LSD Black)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5DEV</strong> <strong>Claimed</strong> <strong>Performance Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Aerodynamic Efficiency</strong>: With a narrower, more aerodynamic profile than other popular cranks, our design saves between 1.3 to 4.4 watts based on CFD analysis at 24mph.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>Low Profile Aero Tip</strong>: Reduces rock strikes while improving airflow.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>Hollow Laser Welded Design</strong>: Engineered for maximum rigidity and weight reduction, this design innovation ensures superior power transfer and durability.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>Vibration</strong> <strong>Absorption</strong>: Reduces leg fatigue on long rides for improved comfort and performance</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out all 5DEV has to offer by hitting the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://5dev.com/\" target=\"_blank\">5DEV.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/5dev-155-160mm-titanium-crank-arms-road-gravel-xc/\">5DEV Machines 155 &amp;160mm Ti Crank Arms to Add to Road/Gravel/XC Crank Lineup</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"df5c9350fe6e2354e90e0b7bec58f50e68a0a77e1506558562ba549da3545a85","category":"Cycling"}
