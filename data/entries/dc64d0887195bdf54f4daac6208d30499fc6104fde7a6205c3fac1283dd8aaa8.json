After 30 years of continuous\ndevelopment, Script Debugger has been retired and will no longer\nbe available for sale. <a href=\"https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/retiring-script-debugger\">Please see this post for more\ninformation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few months we have received a wonderful outpouring\nof well wishes and stories from our customers describing how\nScript Debugger has helped them over the years, via email and on\nour <a href=\"https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/retiring-script-debugger/5071\">forum</a>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Script Debugger is now a free download. Links to all versions of\nScript Debugger from 8.0 to 4.0, along with registration numbers,\nare available on the <a href=\"https://latenightsw.com/sd8/download/\">Downloads page</a>. These free versions\nof Script Debugger are provided AS-IS and without warranty,\nmaintenance or support.</p>\n\n<p>Those seeking a version of Script Debugger for the Classic MacOS\n<a href=\"https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7327-script-debugger-3-0-9\">should go here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That last paragraph speaks to what an incredible run this has been. 30 years ago was 1995 — which was so solidly in the classic Mac era that the OS was still named “System 7”, not “Mac OS 7”. I forget when I first started using Script Debugger, but it was definitely in the classic Mac era. The oldest license number I still have is for Script Debugger 3.0 in 2005, but I’d been using it for years at that point.</p>\n\n<p>Script Debugger isn’t just a spectacularly good Mac developer tool. (Indispensable, I would say. A lot of the problems many scripters have with AppleScript aren’t just mitigated by using Script Debugger instead of Apple’s free Script Editor — they go away.) It has also always come with spectacularly thorough and exceedingly well-written documentation — a good user manual describes <em>what</em> a product does, but a great one also <a href=\"https://latenightsw.com/sd7/support/\">explains <em>how</em> to use it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But even better than that, the product always fostered a community of users. You could email tech support for help and get world-class expert personal assistance, or, you could participate in their (still vibrant!) <a href=\"https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/retiring-script-debugger\">user forum</a>. Late Night Software always was a small team — Mark and Shane Stanley for the last decade or so, big contributions from Matt Neuburg, and, for a long (but not long enough) while prior to that, Mark’s late wife <a href=\"https://markalldritt.com/?page_id=795\">Gerry Tubin</a> — whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Macworld Expos of yesteryear. Late Night Software never felt like a “company” per se. It always felt like a team. They exemplified all of the ideals of the indie Mac developer community and culture. At this point, it’s fair to say Late Night Software helped <em>define</em> those ideals.</p>\n\n<p>But all good things come to an end. I haven’t really spent much time thinking about “apps” retiring, even while at the top of their game, but here we are. To Mark and Shane, I offer my profound thanks and sincere congratulations. What a run. Script Debugger is going out on top.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/02/script-debugger-retired\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc64d0887195bdf54f4daac6208d30499fc6104fde7a6205c3fac1283dd8aaa8","category":"Tech"}
