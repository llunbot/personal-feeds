Now 34 and with Team TotalEnergies, his best days are certainly behind him but he fought on.</p>\n<p>Alongside a host of fans running beside him, keeping their distance but pushing him on, he came in more than an hour behind Kuss, 35 minutes after the last rider, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish</a>, and over 25 minutes outside the time cut.</p>\n<p>Chapeau Eddie.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the best pictures of a great stage from Cyclist's photographer on the scene Chris Auld:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9868/tour-de-france-2021-stage-15-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 41</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_15_photos_01.jpg?itok=r3ZzHGNE\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>41</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9868/tour-de-france-2021-stage-15-gallery\">Tour de France 2021 Stage 15 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>12 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9868%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2015%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9868%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2015%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9868%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2015%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9868%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9868/tour-de-france-2021-stage-15-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 41</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_15_photos_01.jpg?itok=r3ZzHGNE\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0e020c03f7bfaae28d4ad2944693aafe4d42bb8ab28a8ca15bebc7990fb1e4c6","category":"Cycling"}
