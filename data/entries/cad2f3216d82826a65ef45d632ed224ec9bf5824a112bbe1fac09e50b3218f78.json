This sale is just a couple of cents off from the lowest price we've ever seen on this accessory, and it's one of the best prices available online this week. It's also being <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MagSafe-Charger%2F233730734\">matched at Walmart</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone12magsafe.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

It also maintains compatibility with Qi charging, so any iPhone 8 or later device can still use it, as well as AirPods with a Wireless Charging Case and AirPods Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$9 OFF</div>MagSafe Charger for $29.98</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor optimal charging, Apple recommends using a 20W USB-C Power Adapter with the MagSafe Charger, but it's sold separately. However, Costco members this week can <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/magsafe-charger-%2b-20w-usb-c-power-adapter.product.100760848.html\"><strong>save on both of these accessories when bundled together</strong></a>, priced at $39.99. Individually, the 20W USB-C Power Adapter costs $19.00 and the MagSafe Charger costs $39.00, so you're essentially getting the Power Adapter at no extra cost with this deal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, you'll need to be a Costco member to see the deal and be able to purchase it. You'll have until September 10 before the sale ends, and there is a limit of two per member.
