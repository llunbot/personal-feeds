The advanced display technology offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are \"painted\" atop the glass.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYesterday, a Weibo leaker reported that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/next-major-apple-watch-upgrade-to-be-microled/\">next worthwhile upgrade</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra users will be Apple's custom microLED display technology. Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/\">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter initially placing the device's launch in 2024, Young moved his forecast to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/\">second-half of 2025</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>, on the other hand, reported a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/apple-custom-displays-microled-apple-watch/\">2024 time frame</a> earlier this year. TrendForce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/\">claims</a> that Apple's first microLED display will launch on a new Apple Watch Ultra model in 2026, due to supply chain adjustments. With Young and Pu, as well as leaks on Weibo, now pointing to a launch in 2025, the ‌microLED Apple Watch‌ Ultra may launch sooner than previously expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/\">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products.
