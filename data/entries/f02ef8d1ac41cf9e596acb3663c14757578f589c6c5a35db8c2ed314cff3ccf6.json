Pu did not provide any additional details about the lens, or how it will interface with the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 15 Pro models have 48-megapixel main, 12-megapixel ultra wide, and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses. Starting with iOS 17.2, these devices can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/spatial-videos-on-vision-pro-first-impressions/\">record spatial video</a> with 3D depth for playback on the Vision Pro. When held in landscape orientation, the main and ultra wide lenses combine to record spatial video with added depth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this year, Pu said iPhone 16 Pro models would feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/\">48-megapixel ultra wide lens</a>, so the iPhone 17 Pro Max might be the first iPhone model to have a rear camera system entirely with 48-megapixel lenses. Higher megapixels allows for photos to have more detail, which can be useful for cropping and printing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 17 Pro models are expected to launch in September 2025, so they are still nearly two years away, and Apple's plans might not be finalized.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/\">iPhone 17 Pro Max Rumored to Feature 48MP Telephoto Lens</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-max-rumored-to-feature-48mp-telephoto-lens.2413836/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f02ef8d1ac41cf9e596acb3663c14757578f589c6c5a35db8c2ed314cff3ccf6","category":"Apple"}
