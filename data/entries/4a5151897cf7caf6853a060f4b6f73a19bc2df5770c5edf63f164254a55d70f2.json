And of course, some new colors too that are noticeably brighter than last year’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max:</strong> The high-end phones get larger screens (6.32 inches and 6.9 inches), a faster chip (A18 Pro), and better cameras. And the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s enhanced zoom lens should be coming to the smaller model as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Series 10:</strong> The Glowtime event is being held on September 10, exactly 10 years after the Apple Watch made its debut at the iPhone 6 event, so it’s no secret that Apple is planning one of the biggest updates ever. Rumors say the first-ever redesign could be on the way, with larger screens, a thinner body, and flatter edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch SE 3:</strong> After four years of basically the same watch, the 3rd-gen SE looks to be a major overhaul, with a plastic body and a lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 3:</strong> Not much new is expected other than a new chip and maybe a second color option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods:</strong> All of Apple’s AirPods are long overdue for an update and several are candidates for this event. A new budget model could replace the ancient 2nd-gen model with a lower price; a 4th-gen update could bring noise-cancellation and a new design; and an AirPods Max refresh could also be on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad mini: </strong>Not much new is expected from the next mini update other than a new chip and more RAM to make it Apple Intelligence-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Glowtime event: Live blog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the event kicks off, we’ll be updating live as everything is announced. In the meantime, stay tuned for any news and rumors we get ahead of the event:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Store Scandinavia grand opening:</strong> Apple has announced that its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/se/retail/mallofscandinavia/\" target=\"_blank\">newest store in the Mall of Scandinavia</a> will have its grand opening on Friday, September 20, a strong indication that the iPhone 16 will launch on that day.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4a5151897cf7caf6853a060f4b6f73a19bc2df5770c5edf63f164254a55d70f2","category":"Apple"}
