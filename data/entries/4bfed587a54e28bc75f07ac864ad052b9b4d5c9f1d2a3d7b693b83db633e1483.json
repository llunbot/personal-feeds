{"title":"Chip Details of 16 Upcoming Apple Devices Revealed","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed/","date":1709300440000,"content":"The chip details of 16 new Apple devices have been discovered, according to technical information posted on X earlier today by a private account with a proven track record of sharing accurate information about Apple's plans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nEight unreleased Apple devices with the A14 Bionic, A17 Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chips were among the list of chip identifiers (CPIDs). There are two upcoming A14 Bionic and A17 Pro devices, and four upcoming ‌M2‌ devices. <em>MacRumors</em> believes they relate to the following products:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li><strong>A14 Bionic</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> (11th-generation) in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations. The model number does not correlate to what the ‌iPad‌ (11th-generation) is expected to have, so it may be a modified ‌iPad‌ (10th-generation) in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations instead, or potentially a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> with a display.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>A17</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> (seventh-generation) in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations. This may be the A17 Pro chip or an A17 variant.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>M2</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> (sixth-generation) in 10.9- and 12.9-inch display sizes and in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf they relate to a new entry-level ‌iPad‌ model, the chip identifiers suggest that the device will not receive a chip upgrade in its next incarnation. The current, 10th-generation ‌iPad‌ already contains an A14 Bionic chip. The chances of this device being a ‌HomePod‌ with a display are slim due to model number trends, but the possibility cannot be ruled out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current, sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ model contains the A15 Bionic and some previous speculation suggested that the device would be most likely to feature the A16 Bionic in its next generation, so an A17 chipset would be a significant upgrade. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere were also eight more identifiers for two unreleased chips that likely relate to the four models in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup and the next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> in 11- and 13-inch display sizes. The next-generation ‌iPad Pro‌ is widely rumored to launch later this month and feature the M3 chip that Apple first introduced in October 2023. However, the sequence of identifiers raises the unexpected possibility of the ‌iPad Pro‌ containing the M4 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe information suggests that the entire ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup will feature the same A18 chip, corroborating <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/\">previous reports</a>. The source who posted the information told <em>MacRumors</em> that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will still likely feature a chip branded as an \"A18 Pro,\" even though the entire lineup of chips features the same CPID. The standard \"A18\" chip in the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus may have some binned or disabled modules to differentiate it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this week, the source posted which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ipados-18-compatible-ipads-rumor/\">iPad</a> models will be supported by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>. The account prefers to keep a low profile, but much of its previously posted information and many of its claims have been proven to be true.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed/\">Chip Details of 16 Upcoming Apple Devices Revealed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed.2420792/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4bfed587a54e28bc75f07ac864ad052b9b4d5c9f1d2a3d7b693b83db633e1483","category":"Apple"}
