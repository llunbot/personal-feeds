This initiative allows developers and public beta testers to gain access to the updates before they’re released, so they can help test for bugs and give any new features a thorough workout before they’re unleashed on the general public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will reveal the details of the next round of operating system updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a>), which kicks off with a keynote on Monday June 9 at 10am PT. Soon after the keynote closes the first developer betas of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2766625/ipados-19-release-date-compatilbity-features-beta.html\">iPadOS 19</a>, watchOS 12, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 16</a> will arrive and anyone who wants to install them will be able to test them out ahead of the public release in September. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we explain how to get involved with testing the betas, but also point out some of the reasons why you may wish to give it a pass and wait for the final versions to arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When will the Apple betas come out?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first developer betas will arrive just after the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC</a> keynote on June 10, around noon PT. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first public betas are likely to arrive in early July.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developer beta vs public beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The developer beta is, as the name suggests, intended for developers only, but Apple does offer a beta testing program for members of the public who would like to try out new features and find bugs. The public beta is slightly safer to use than the developer beta, but we would still suggest caution: don’t install the beta on your only iPhone or your work Mac just in case you encounter problems.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developer Beta:</strong> Meant for developers who need to get their apps working on the new operating system. The developer beta arrives immediately following the keynote and usually a day or two before subsequent public betas. You need to be a member of Apple’s developer program to install developer betas, but you don’t need to pay the annual $99 fee anymore to get the beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Public Beta:</strong> Usually a few steps behind the developer beta, which essentially means that the public beta will be slightly more stable. There is usually a slightly longer wait until the first version of the public beta arrives, but once the programs are underway there are usually only a few days between the developer beta being released and the public version arrives.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Beta-test-Apple-Mac-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple beta Mac and iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Beta-test-Apple-Mac-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Beta-test-Apple-Mac-iPhone.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Beta-test-Apple-Mac-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Beta-test-Apple-Mac-iPhone.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Test that your apps work on the upcoming Apple software.</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Apple’s beta program free?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s beta program is a chance for volunteers to download a beta version of the new operating system for their device and test it out. Best of all, it’s completely free because even the developer beta no longer requires paid membership. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be necessary for developers to sign up for the full <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/\">Apple Developer Program</a>, which costs $99/£79 a year, but since 2023 you can get the developer beta with a free developer account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to join Apple’s beta program</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple runs a <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com\">Beta Software program</a> via which you can get beta copies of its operating system software before they are released to the public. The beta testing runs up to the launch of the operating system and then continues with further approximately monthly updates introducing even more new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to join the program, and you aren’t concerned that the beta software could have bugs that could render your iPhone, iPad, Mac or other Apple product useless, joining Apple’s beta program is really easy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining Apple’s developer beta program is a little more complicated than the public beta because you need to register for a free developer account. We’ll run through how to get both the public and developer betas below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get a free Apple developer account</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to get a free Apple developer account is to follow these steps. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>On an iPhone download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-developer/id640199958\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Developer app</a> from the iOS App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the Apple Developer app on your iPhone and tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>Sign In</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get to the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are signed in on the developer app follow these steps to see the latest developer beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on <em>Software Update</em> and you should see Beta Updates as an option.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you don’t automatically see a bata to download, tap on Beta Updates and select the Developer Beta. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies to iPadOS, macOS and Apple Watch. Just go to the Software Update section and you will see the available beta versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">How to get the macOS beta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">How to get the iOS beta</a> for more advice and details of the latest beta version.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ios 18 developer beta\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5344w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-developer-beta.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get the public beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The free public beta testing program is open to anyone with a valid Apple ID (iCloud accounts qualify) who goes to the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Beta Software Program page</a> and signs up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sign up for public betas you’ll need to go to the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Beta Software Program</a> site.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select <em>Sign Up</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in with your Apple ID</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow the prompts to register.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have registered, getting the beta on your device is easy:</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ios 18 public beta\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5344w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ios-18-public-beta.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get the iOS/iPadOS beta</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Got to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em>.

If you rely on your device for work, we recommend waiting until the full version is released in the fall, but otherwise, beta updates are a personal choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few reasons why becoming a beta tester for the next version of iOS or macOS might seem attractive. First and foremost, they let you try out new features before they’re released, and sometimes features that are never released. Occasionally, Apple will pull a feature that was beta-tested before the general release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a beta tester also gives you a chance to shape the development of the software. Your feedback, while not necessary, could be invaluable in stopping a bug or just generally improving the quality of the software on your Mac or iPhone. You will be providing a service to others in ensuring that all bugs are ironed out before the final release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, beta software, by its very nature, is unstable and it’s worth noting that participating in Apple’s Beta Software Program could cause serious problems with your device. You should consider whether it’s right for you before downloading and installing the pre-release software, which is bound to have bugs and issues that could cause things to go spectacularly wrong. This won’t be helped by the fact that Apple does not offer official support for pre-release software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that we would heavily advise against putting it on a device upon which you’re reliant. Bugs in the code could see the device stop working at any moment or in rare cases it could actually “brick” your machine until the next beta update arrives. It’s best to install the beta on an older device if you have one. If you don’t have a spare Mac on hand you should consider <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672589/how-to-dual-boot-mac-run-macos-together.html\">installing the macOS beta on a separate volume</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672585/how-to-install-macos-on-an-external-drive.html\">running it on an external drive</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The threat of bugs and other stability issues is a good reason to think carefully about whether you want to take the risk of using the beta. If you do decide to install the beta software, make sure that you <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">create a full backup</a> beforehand. Check out our list of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668696/best-mac-backup-software.html\">best backup software for Mac</a> for some great options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What does being an Apple beta tester mean?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of the beta program is to provide Apple with feedback about the upcoming release. Expect there to be bugs and general issues—software offered through the beta program are not finished products, by installing it you are agreeing to become a tester and helping Apple to iron out these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you encounter bugs or other issues, you can report them using the Feedback Assistant app. The app will let you provide information about what you were doing at the time of the crash so Apple can diagnose the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main purpose of a beta tester is to locate bugs, but you can also provide feedback on interface oddities and other UI issues. Apple may change things if enough people have problems with the way something is designed—much like <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350064/safari-ios-15-interface-address-bar-tab-groups-gestures-refresh.html\">Safari</a> in iOS 15.  You can also provide feedback on third-party apps that aren’t working as they should.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I leave the beta program?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If, at any point, you decide that you’d like to end your participation in the beta software program, simply turn off beta updates on your device and the next available full release will install once it arrives.
