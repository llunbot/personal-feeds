{"title":"Production on 15-Inch MacBook Air Components Underway, WWDC Launch Looking Likely","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/15-inch-macbook-air-component-production/","date":1681148820000,"content":"Panel production on the larger-screened 15-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> started in February and increased in March, with another ramp up planned for April, respected display analyst Ross Young said today in a tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1645454528031096833\">shared with subscribers</a>. With production underway, Young said that he doesn't know the \"precise launch timing\" but assumes that it could happen in \"late April/early May.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/m2-macbook-air-pink.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nYoung previously suggested that the 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/15-inch-macbook-air-april-ross-young/\">could launch in April</a>, but his estimated launch timeline may be a little too early. At this point, it looks like a spring Apple event is not going to happen, and it seems unlikely that Apple would introduce a new iteration of the ‌MacBook Air‌ via press release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith WWDC coming in less than two months, it perhaps makes the most sense for Apple to introduce the 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ at the Worldwide Developers Keynote on June 5, with a launch following shortly thereafter in June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEither way, it sounds like a larger ‌MacBook Air‌ is coming in the first half of the year, with the machine set to join the 13.6-inch version. Rumors suggest that the ‌MacBook Air‌ could feature a 15.5-inch display, which would make it around the size of the now-discontinued 15.4-inch MacBook Pro. It would be sized between the 13.6-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ and the 16-inch MacBook Pro, giving those who want a slimmer, lighter, and more affordable machine with a larger display size an option that is not a \"Pro\" notebook.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDesign wise, the 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ is expected to feature the same design as the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> model, which could also see a refresh alongside the new 15-inch version. Exactly which chip the ‌MacBook Air‌ will use remains to be seen, but it could include the current-generation ‌M2‌ and ‌M2‌ Pro chips, or the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a> chip series, if it is ready for launch by WWDC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore information on Apple's plans for the 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/15-inch-macbook-air/\">found in our 15-inch MacBook Air guide</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/15-inch-macbook-air-component-production/\">Production on 15-Inch MacBook Air Components Underway, WWDC Launch Looking Likely</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/production-on-15-inch-macbook-air-components-underway-wwdc-launch-looking-likely.2386459/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2912d4c0f7a281141f6aec62261d2d21ed90bf9d966470cd6af1e5918d717199","category":"Apple"}
