Apple updated the 13-inch MacBook Pro at WWDC 2022 with an M2 processor but kept the same design despite introducing a redesigned MacBook Air and larger MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman doesn’t state whether Apple will redesign the 13-inch MacBook Pro, but it seems unlikely. Apple already has a 13-inch MacBook Air and a 14-inch MacBook Pro, so another model that looks similar would only add confusion and redundancy to the lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, for the same reasons, it’s surprising that Apple would update the 13-inch MacBook Pro at all. It’s the only model to use Apple’s older laptop design with a Touch Bar instead of a function row, and doesn’t have a Liquid Retina display or 1080p FaceTime camera. Yet it still starts at $1,299, $100 more than the entry-level M2 MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presumably, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro would get an M3 processor, but the timing of that chip is unclear. Gurman says the next-gen chip isn’t ready for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC 2023</a>, which likely means a late fall or early 2024 unveiling.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d149acd737f88f84ce871d8a43392622d99a3bafa26bd72b9f29cac3b3521013","category":"Apple"}
