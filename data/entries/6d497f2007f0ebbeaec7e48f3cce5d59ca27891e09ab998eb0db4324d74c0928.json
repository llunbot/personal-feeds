All 3 share the same low profile hooked tubeless carbon rim, with their differences coming in carbon layup and how fancy a wheel build you want to pay for. Weights tip the scales as low as 1251g at the most premium end of the spectrum. While pricing at the entry-level is as low as $1450, while still not even giving up a couple hundred grams in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Reynolds 25mm deep lightweight carbon road wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_BlackLabel-rim-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_BlackLabel-rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Reynolds 25mm ultralight carbon road bike climbers wheels, Blacklabel rim detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_BlackLabel-rim-detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_BlackLabel-rim-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_BlackLabel-rim-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_BlackLabel-rim-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Reynolds)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Any way you look at it, a new set of Reynolds 25mm deep carbon climbers’ wheels will help you crush your local climbs and set some new best times.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Reynolds 25mm ultralight carbon road bike climbers wheels, riding mountains\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_mountain-road-climbing.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero may be everything on the flats and rolling terrain, but roadies who ride in the mountains know that an ultralight climbers’ wheelset simply feels different.

With a max 30mm external width to pair well with wide modern road bike tires – optimized for 28mm tires. The wheels are low-profile, but Reynolds assures that the shape has been aerodynamically optimized, to claw back any of those incremental aero gains possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they all stick with hooked tubeless beads for compatibility with all types – and tube-type or tubeless setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples.jpg\" alt=\"Reynolds 25mm ultralight carbon road bike climbers wheels, internal nipples\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_blacklabel-internal-nipples-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rim difference being that the two top BlackLabel wheels are built with a carbon rim featuring Reynolds’ premium CR6, higher modulus carbon layup. And, they are built for internal spoke nipples. Then the AR wheelset uses a slightly heavier, slightly less stiff CR3 layup and sticks with conventional external nipples. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_I9-Torch-hub-blacklabel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_I9-Torch-hub-blacklabel-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Reynolds Blacklabel 25 Pro hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_I9-Torch-hub-blacklabel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_I9-Torch-hub-blacklabel-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_I9-Torch-hub-blacklabel-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_I9-Torch-hub-blacklabel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_I9-Torch-hub-blacklabel.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Reynolds Blacklabel 25 Pro hub</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_Ringle-Super-Bubba-X-hub-blacklabel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_Ringle-Super-Bubba-X-hub-blacklabel-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Reynolds Blacklabel 25 Expert hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_Ringle-Super-Bubba-X-hub-blacklabel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_Ringle-Super-Bubba-X-hub-blacklabel-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_Ringle-Super-Bubba-X-hub-blacklabel-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_Ringle-Super-Bubba-X-hub-blacklabel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_Ringle-Super-Bubba-X-hub-blacklabel.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Blacklabel 25 Expert hub</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_SUNRingle-SRX-hub-AR.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_SUNRingle-SRX-hub-AR-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Reynolds 25mm ultralight carbon road bike climbers wheels, SUN Ringle hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_SUNRingle-SRX-hub-AR-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_SUNRingle-SRX-hub-AR-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_SUNRingle-SRX-hub-AR-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_SUNRingle-SRX-hub-AR-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reynolds-25mm-deep-lightweight-carbon-road-wheels_SUNRingle-SRX-hub-AR.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Reynolds AR 25 hub</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hub spec is the other big point where the different wheelsets diverge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-tier goes with Industry Nine Torch hubs with 6° engagement from 3 pawls.
