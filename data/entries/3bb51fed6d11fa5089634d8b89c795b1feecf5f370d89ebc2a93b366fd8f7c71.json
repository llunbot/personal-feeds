That victory declaration comes despite the fact that no human player has yet to clear \"Trimming the Herbs\" (TTH), the ultra-hard level that gained notoriety this month as what was thought to be the final \"uncleared\" level in the game.</p>\n<p>This strange confluence of events is the result of an admission by Ahoyo, the creator of Trimming the Herbs, who came clean Friday evening regarding his use of <a href=\"https://tasvideos.org/WelcomeToTASVideos\">automated, tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) methods</a> in creating the level. That means he was able to use superhuman capabilities like slow-motion, rewinding, and frame advance to pre-record the precise set of perfectly timed inputs needed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siz4oB4CGKo\">craft the \"creator clear\"</a> that was necessary to upload the level in the first place.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Ahoyo's video of a \"creator clear\" for Trimming the Herbs, which he now admits was created using TAS methods. </p></div>\n<p>\"I’m sorry for the drama [my level] caused within the community, and I regret the ordeal,\" Ahoyo <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/394519186610847754/1220808827621085294/1220844130947563541\">wrote on the Team 0% Discord</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ahoyoo_Twitch/status/1771286936944099483\">social media</a>. \"But at least it was interesting.
