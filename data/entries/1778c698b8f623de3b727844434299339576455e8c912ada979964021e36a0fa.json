While the Rule 9(b) pleading requirements are less stringent here, where Tesla allegedly engaged in a systematic pattern of fraud over a long period of time, LoSavio alleges, plausibly and with sufficient detail, that he relied on these representations before buying his car.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tesla previously won a significant ruling in the case when a different <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/judge-upholds-tesla-arbitration-agreement-that-drivers-called-unconscionable/\">judge upheld the carmaker's arbitration agreement</a> and ruled that four plaintiffs would have to go to arbitration. But LoSavio had opted out of the arbitration agreement and was given the option of filing an amended complaint.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024945#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024945&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1778c698b8f623de3b727844434299339576455e8c912ada979964021e36a0fa","category":"Tech"}
