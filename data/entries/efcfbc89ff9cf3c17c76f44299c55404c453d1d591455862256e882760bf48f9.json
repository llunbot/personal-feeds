That turned out to not be entirely correct, since Google had neglected to consider the storage available to supercomputers; if that were included, the quantum computer's lead shrank to just a matter of days.</p>\n<p>Adding just a handful of additional qubits, however, would re-establish the quantum computer's vast lead. Recently, however, a draft manuscript was placed on the arXiv that points out a critical fact: Google's claims relied on comparisons to a very specific approach to performing the calculation on standard computing hardware. There are other ways to perform the calculation, and the paper suggests one of those would allow a supercomputer to actually pull ahead of its quantum competitor.</p>\n<h2>More than one road to random</h2>\n<p>The calculation Google performed was specifically designed to be difficult to simulate on a normal computer. It set the 54 qubits of its Sycamore processor in a random state, then let quantum interference among neighboring qubits influence how the system evolves over time. After a short interval, the hardware started repeatedly measuring the state of the qubits. Each individual measurement produced a string of random bits, making Sycamore into a very expensive random-number generator. But if enough measurements are made, certain patterns generated by the quantum interference become apparent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815378#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815378&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"efcfbc89ff9cf3c17c76f44299c55404c453d1d591455862256e882760bf48f9","category":"Tech"}
