Though Valve's statement doesn't clarify exactly which materials are affected, it's quite likely that the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/no-end-in-sight-for-chip-shortage-as-supply-chain-problems-pile-up/\">global chip shortage</a> is to blame.</p>\n<p>All existing Steam Deck orders will be bumped accordingly, Valve suggests, and the company still plans to fulfill purchases for all three Steam Deck models in the order they were received. Valve has already updated the system's Steam store page to inform customers of new shipment estimates, and Ars Technica can confirm that a previous \"Q4 2021\" order is now pegged for \"Q1 2022.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811986#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811986&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"413f54cb66633f2207b931299d4eed7d6a08f62394aa2e6c48ee45f8247c65b0","category":"Tech"}
