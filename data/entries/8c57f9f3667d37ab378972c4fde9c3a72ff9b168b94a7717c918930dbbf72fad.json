For a while, it was the sole gravel bike in the line-up, but the last year or so has seen the brand expand its gravel offerings with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/bianchi-impulso-e-road-review/\">Bianchi Impulso E-Road</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/bianchi-arcadex-review/\">Bianchi Arcadex</a>.</p>\n<p>Where the Arcadex is pitched more towards technical off-road riding, the Impulso Pro now fills in the faster end of the gravel spectrum for Bianchi.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bianchi says the Impulso Pro is designed for gravel racing and fast riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Francesco Rachello / Tornanti.cc</i></span></div>\n<h2>Go-fast geometry</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">geometry</a> reflects this with steeper head tube and seat tube angles than the Arcadex. This is matched with a shorter wheelbase.</p>\n<p>Bianchi says the geometry creates a “super-responsive and rigid ride” that reflects the brand’s racing pedigree. In a world filled with dropped chainstays enormous fork crowns, the Impulso stands out with a fairly traditional and clean silhouette.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Semi-internal routing helps achieve a clean look.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Francesco Rachello / Tornanti.cc</i></span></div>\n<h2>Carbon frame and conservative tyre clearance</h2>\n<p>Whereas the Impulso All-Road has an aluminium frame, the Impluso Pro is only available with a full carbon frameset.</p>\n<p>Bianchi quotes a claimed frame weight of 1,100g, but it hasn’t specified what size frame this weight is for, whether this is a painted frame or whether it includes any hardware.</p>\n<p>Bianchi quotes a maximum tyre clearance of 38mm with 700c wheels for the Impulso Pro (confusingly, Bianchi also states 37mm elsewhere in its press release for the bike – we’ve asked for clarification). This is on the narrower side for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">best gravel bike tyres</a>, with 40mm being something of a de facto standard for most gravel bikes.</p>\n<p>That relatively limited tyre clearance may put off riders who are more interested in gnarly off-road <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a> adventures, but for those who like to ride fast on gravel roads or more mellow terrain, it may be sufficient.</p>\n<h2>Shimano GRX 1x and two colour options</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Impulso Pro comes in Bianchi’s signature celeste and this sage green colour scheme.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Francesco Rachello / Tornanti.cc</i></span></div>\n<p>At launch, the bike is available in a single <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-grx-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano GRX 600</a> build, set up with a 1× drivetrain with a 40t chainring and an 11-42t cassette. The bike is also compatible with 2× drivetrains via a removable front derailleur mount.</p>\n<p>The Veloman wheelset is 24mm-deep, with a 21mm internal width. The rims are fitted with 37mm-wide WTB Riddler Comp gravel tyres.</p>\n<p>Velomann also provides the handlebar, stem and alloy seatpost, while the saddle is from Selle Italia.</p>\n<p>The Impulso Pro comes in two colour schemes. One takes Bianchi’s unmistakable signature celeste colour and introduces different shades for variation across the bike, and the other contrasts different sage greens.</p>\n<p>The bike is available in six sizes (48cm to 58cm) and will cost £3,400. Further international pricing is TBC.</p>\n<h2>Bianchi Imuplso Pro spec</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Bianchi Impulsom Pro carbon fibre</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Bianchi full carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Shimano GRX 600, 40t chainring, 11-42t cassette</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Shimano BR-RX400</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Velomann disc 700c 622-21</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Riddler Comp 37mm</li>\n<li><strong>Bar:</strong> Velomann RA68A alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Stem: </strong>Velomann ST182A alloy 6061</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Selle Italia Model X Superflow FeC</li>\n<li><strong>Seatpost:</strong> Velomann SP02.1 alloy 6061</li>\n</ul>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8c57f9f3667d37ab378972c4fde9c3a72ff9b168b94a7717c918930dbbf72fad","category":"Cycling"}
