This time, it's Google Drive, which has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/\">mysteriously losing files</a> for some people. Google acknowledged the issue on November 27, and a week later, it posted what it called a fix.</p>\n<p>It doesn't feel like Google is describing this issue correctly; the company still calls it a \"syncing issue\" with the Drive desktop app versions 84.0.0.0 through 84.0.4.0. Syncing problems would only mean files don't make it to or from the cloud, and that doesn't explain why people are completely losing files. In the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en&amp;sjid=9779374175483664470-NA\">most popular</a> issue thread on the Google Drive Community forums, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246232590\">several</a> <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246259260\">users</a> <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246980076\">describe</a> <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246762363\">spreadsheets</a> and documents going missing, which all would have been created and saved in the web interface, not the desktop app, and it's hard to see how the desktop app could affect that. Many users peg \"May 2023\" as the time documents stopped saving. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246116775\">Some say</a> they've never used the desktop app.</p>\n<p>Drive has multiple ways of syncing files, which complicates any explanation or diagnosis of what's going on. The most suspect mode in the whole fiasco is the default \"file streaming,\" mode which is actually cloud-first. Files get <em>removed</em> from your computer and stored in the cloud, saving space and leaving only a web link in their place. Perhaps a \"syncing\" issue could remove files from your computer before uploading (that still doesn't explain the claims of missing web documents, though).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989435#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989435&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2a1afa74832625b380acff30230addafc4b107a270c61d2b0b0a881964629cf","category":"Tech"}
