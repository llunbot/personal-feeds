That seems to have been a bit of foreshadowing as TPC faced tough times since then along with mass layoffs. Now, TPC has announced that they will be closing up shop, for good—sad news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to posting the press release below on their LinkedIn page, TPC is holding a <a href=\"https://www.theproscloset.com\" target=\"_blank\">Going Out of Business Sale</a> with up to 75% off sitewide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Louisville, CO – 9/26/24 – After 18 remarkable years of serving the cycling community, The Pro’s Closet (TPC) will close its doors in October. Since our founding, we’ve had the privilege of helping over 160,000 customers find their perfect ride and have sold more than 46,000 bikes. It’s been a hell of a ride, and we couldn’t be more thankful to the customers, employees, and vendors who made this journey possible</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“This has been an extraordinary chapter in the world of cycling, and we’re incredibly grateful to everyone who has been a part of it,” said Jonathan Czaja, CEO of The Pro’s Closet. “From our dedicated team to the loyal riders and industry partners, your support allowed us to grow and create a lasting impact. While this is the end of the road for TPC, as it operates today, we are proud of what we’ve accomplished together.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Pro’s Closet began with a vision to make cycling more accessible by offering a better way to buy and sell used bikes while becoming the first true “certified pre-owned” bike offering in the cycling industry. Over the years, we’ve remained committed to providing exceptional service and spreading the joy of cycling. As we close this chapter, we reflect on the community we’ve built and the countless miles our customers have ridden.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Because at the end of the day, Bikes make it better—and we still believe, Bikes are meant to be used.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theproscloset.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TheProsCloset.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-pros-closet-going-out-of-business-sale/\">Come October, The Pro’s Closet Will be Closing Up Shop</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6b4f5d3eb726fc6085ac764e882747380a4500bdc1a1b7944e7f253ad8241d3e","category":"Cycling"}
