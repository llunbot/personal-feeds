{"title":"NYPD Is Encouraging New Yorkers to Plant AirTags in Their Cars for Theft Recovery","link":"https://twitter.com/NYPDChiefOfDept/status/1652759702697017345","date":1682991311000,"content":"\n<p>NYPD chief Jeffrey Maddrey, on Twitter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The 21st century calls for 21st century policing. AirTags in\nyour car will help us recover your vehicle if it’s stolen. We’ll\nuse our drones, our StarChase technology and good old fashion\npolice work to safely recover your stolen car. Help us help you,\nget an AirTag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/nypd-encourages-car-owners-to-use-airtags/\">Juli Clover, at MacRumors</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In an accompanying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw72THyXsQ\">press conference on Sunday</a>, New York\nCity mayor Eric Adams said that the city will provide 500 free\nAirTags to car owners. According to <em><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/watch-mayor-adams-makes-public-safety-announcement-in-the-bronx/\">CBS News</a></em> , the\nAirTags are available to residents in Castle Hill, Soundview, and\nParkchester, as these areas have seen a 548 percent increase in\nstolen Hyundai and Kia vehicles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a case where, ideally, you’d want FindMy (or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Apple’s Tracker Detect app</a> for Android) <em>not</em> to notify a potential thief that they’re being tracked by an unknown-to-them AirTag. But we can’t have it both ways. There’s no magic way to mark <em>your</em> AirTag as not being used for stalking.</p>\n\n<p>One spitball idea: Apple could license AirTag technology to be built into third-party products. With cars, they could make it part of the CarPlay system — have an AirTag integrated with the dashboard console system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I forgot that Apple <em>does</em> license FindMy this way: <a href=\"https://support.vanmoof.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002192135-how-do-i-connect-my-bike-with-the-apple-find-my-network-\">VanMoof e-bikes have FindMy support</a>. I was reminded of this today by a DF reader who found his stolen bike this week using it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/01/nypd-cars-airtags\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2f23e7d4ea0a914e5525e724f978525738cda2837dc52340ba66f4193030bf1c","category":"Tech"}
