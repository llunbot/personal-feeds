New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will include the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, faster successors that build upon the foundation of the original M1, as well as more ports, and a slight redesign. This marks the most significant change to the MacBook Pro since the Touch Bar was introduced back in 2016.</p>\n<p>Both MacBook Pro models will be <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/a1AbjW\" target=\"_blank\">available for ordering today</a>, and they'll begin shipping next week. The 14-inch model starts at $1999, which will get you a version of the M1 Pro with an 8-core CPU and 14-core GPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. The 16-inch model will start at $2,499, which includes the full version of the M1 Pro with a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. Color options remain relatively staid: you can get silver or space gray, but not the rainbow of color options you get with the 24-inch iMac.</p>\n<p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro uses a 16.2-inch display with a 3456×2234 pixel resolution, while the 14-inch model uses a 14.2-inch display with a 3456×2234 resolution. Both screens use mini LED backlighting and slimmer bezels almost all the way around the screen, albeit at the expense of an iPhone-style display notch at the top of the screen for the improved 1080p webcam. Both screens also support Apple's ProMotion feature, increasing the typical 60 Hz refresh rate up to a smoother 120 Hz.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770454#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770454&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b3dcc193f9bed84fb3831560f7804cb6f3729101300eee7afafff2736d9e3dc9","category":"Tech"}
