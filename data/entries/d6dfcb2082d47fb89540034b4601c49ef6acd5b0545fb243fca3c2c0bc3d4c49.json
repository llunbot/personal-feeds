This was no ordinary thunderstorm.</p>\n<p>Hunga is infamous for its tantrums, but it has outdone itself. That storm now boasts the most lightning ever recorded on Earth. Hanging ominously above the Pacific Ocean was a volcanic cloud lit by concentric rings of lightning that flashed about 192,000 times over the 11 hours that the volcano was active (that’s some 2,615 flashes a minute). Lightning shot up to 30 km (19 miles) high—another record, beating even cyclones and supercells.</p>\n<p>Led by volcanologist Alexa Van Eaton of the US Geological Survey, a team of researchers who took a closer look at the observations from the Hunga eruption and ensuing storm found that no one has ever recorded lightning so extreme. “Our findings show that a sufficiently powerful volcanic plume can create its own weather system, sustaining the conditions for electrical activity at heights and rates not previously observed,” Van Eaton and her team said in a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL102341\">study</a> recently published in Geophysical Research Letters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950380#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950380&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6dfcb2082d47fb89540034b4601c49ef6acd5b0545fb243fca3c2c0bc3d4c49","category":"Tech"}
