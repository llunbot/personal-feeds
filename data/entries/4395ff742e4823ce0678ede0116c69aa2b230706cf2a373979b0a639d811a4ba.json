Grant finished in just over seven hours, 24 minutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three racers were within spitting distance on the Powerline climb, with Grant just ten seconds off the back of Wilson and Sturm. A late surge pushed her past both and into the lead ahead of the final climb up to Leadville.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swenson finished in a time of 6:09:27, just ahead of EF’s Lachlan Morton in 6:19:46. Rio Olympian Howard Grotts crossed the line third just after 6:22. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s lead trio came off the Columbine climb together and Swenson waited until one of the final tests, the steep slopes of the Powerline climb at mile 75, to make his move. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I wanted to get out of sight and then push that gap a little more on the rocky descent on the backside,” he said at the finish. “Then after that just try to ride smooth. Lachlan is a hell of a rider, so is Howard, so I was just trying not to cramp, ride my own pace.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Women’s results:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Rose Grant in 7:24:15</li><li>Moriah Wilson in 7:27:32</li><li>Sarah Sturm in 7:30:56</li><li>Hannah Finchamp in 7:45:13</li><li>Katerina Nash in 7:47:39</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>View <a href=\"https://www.athlinks.com/event/219291/results/Event/977373/Course/2089959/Division/1749241/Results\">full results here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E8xzYNWVUAIS0EZ-1340x993.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Rose Grant wins the 2021 Leadville Trail 100.
