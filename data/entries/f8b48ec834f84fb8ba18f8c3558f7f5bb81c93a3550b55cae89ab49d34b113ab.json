They’re also well-padded, and have a few other handy features to keep things organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the pad is a soft, fleecy material that won’t scratch the paint on your truck. A rear hatch can be pulled up to reveal the tailgate handle or backup camera when not loading a bike in the center.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-2-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details on saris tailgate pad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bikes rest between padded blocks, minimizing shifting. Straps use buckles with “G” hooks, which won’t wear out like Velcro. The straps are long enough to fit around even the fattest e-bike downtubes, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-3-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details on saris tailgate pad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-3.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main body has 30mm of thick foam to protect your bike’s frame, with thicker 40mm dual-density foam to pad the fork and stanchions hanging off the back. Two 11×6″ storage pockets hang on the inside to carry gloves, tools, mini pumps, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-4.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-4-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details on saris tailgate pad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-tailgate-pad-truck-bed-bike-transportation-4.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses the same G-hook straps to secure the pad to your tailgate and comes with this handy tool to help slide the buckle through the gap during installation. Just tuck the tool into one of the storage pockets when done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $219 for the 5-bike pad (51.125″ wide), and $229 for the 6-bike (59″ wide).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-mod-tail-lights-for-hitch-bike-rack.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-mod-tail-lights-for-hitch-bike-rack-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"taillights for saris modular hitch bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-mod-tail-lights-for-hitch-bike-rack-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-mod-tail-lights-for-hitch-bike-rack-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-mod-tail-lights-for-hitch-bike-rack-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-mod-tail-lights-for-hitch-bike-rack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/saris-mod-tail-lights-for-hitch-bike-rack.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Separately, Saris’ MHS (Modular Hitch System) lineup gets a taillight kit ($189.99) to add rear lights, brake lights, and turn signals to your rack. The 45º tilt angle keeps it visible whether the rack is up or down. Pair it with bike trays, cargo baskets, or (soon) even enclosed storage bins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://saris.com\" target=\"_blank\">Saris.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/saris-tailgate-pad/\">Saris Tailgate Pad Hooks Up Easier Installation &amp; Bike Transport</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f8b48ec834f84fb8ba18f8c3558f7f5bb81c93a3550b55cae89ab49d34b113ab","category":"Cycling"}
