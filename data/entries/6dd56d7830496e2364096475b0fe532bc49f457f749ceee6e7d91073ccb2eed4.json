The company is also releasing security updates for a few previous-generation operating systems, so that people who aren't ready to upgrade (and older devices that can't upgrade) will still be protected from new exploits.</p>\n<p>Those updates include <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213981\">iOS and iPadOS 16.7.2</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213990\">15.8</a>, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213985\">macOS Ventura 13.6.1</a>,<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213983\"> macOS Monterey 12.7.1</a>, and the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213986\">Safari 17.1 update</a> for both of those macOS versions. At least for now, the iOS and iPadOS 16 updates cover older iPhones and iPads that can't run iOS 17 and newer devices whose owners simply don't want to install iOS 17 yet. Apple will eventually <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/apple-releases-ios-15-security-updates-for-devices-that-cant-upgrade-to-16/\">stop supporting newer hardware</a> with iOS 16 security updates, but for now, the grace period is still in effect.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first security update that Apple has delivered for iOS 15 since mid-September, suggesting that the company plans to keep supporting 2021's iOS release with continued security updates for at least a while longer. The iOS 15.8 update will only run on phones and tablets that can't install iOS 16 or 17, including the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 7, the original iPhone SE, the iPad Air 2, and the last iPod Touch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978048#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978048&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6dd56d7830496e2364096475b0fe532bc49f457f749ceee6e7d91073ccb2eed4","category":"Tech"}
