It suggested the title of the docuseries will be ‘Tour de France: Au Cœr du peloton’, roughly translated as ‘in the heart of the peloton’.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Have you seen the sneak peek of the Netflix Tour de France series yet 👀😍🇫🇷 Find out more 👉🏻 <a href=\"https://t.co/4eq2Jg3snH\">https://t.co/4eq2Jg3snH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PkoHxtJbCM\">pic.twitter.com/PkoHxtJbCM</a></p>— BikeRadar (@bikeradar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bikeradar/status/1633843706381094916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 9, 2023</a></blockquote><h2>First episode focuses on Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Fabio Jakobsen celebrating as he wins stage 2 of the 2022 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stuart Franklin / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>While we know the series will cover the trials and tribulations of eight teams at the 2022 edition of the race, RMC <a href=\"https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/cyclisme/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-ce-qu-on-verra-dans-le-serie-netflix-sur-la-grande-boucle_AV-202304170654.html\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> the first episode screened at CanneSeries focused primarily on Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl.</p>\n<p>RMC says the episode looks at the decisions of team boss Patrick Lefevere, the non-selection of Julian Alaphilippe and Fabio Jakobsen’s success at the race following his life-threatening crash at the 2020 Tour of Poland.</p>\n<p>Yann Le Bourbouac’h, one of the producers, explained to RMC how they “tried to work on the boundary between documentary and cinema” seeking out characters in the race.</p>\n<p>“With Fabio, we tried to show that he had almost died two years ago and that two years later he is doing his first Tour de France and winning a stage,” Le Bourbouac’h explained.</p>\n<p>Alongside the series following Jumbo-Visma’s overall winner Jonas Vingegaard, RMC also reports an episode will be focused around Groupama-FDJ and Thibaut Pinot.</p>\n<p>Pinot featured in the teaser trailer, stating how “when you are French and in a French team, you’re in for a huge amount of pressure [at the Tour de France].”</p>\n<h2>Drive to Survive, but with bikes?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tom Pidcock climbing Alpe D’Huez on stage 12 of the 2022 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Michael Steele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Quadbox, a joint venture between production company Quad and Box to Box Films, is producing the Tour de France series.</p>\n<p>Box to Box films is the sports film producer behind Netflix’s incredibly popular Formula 1 series <em>Drive to Survive</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Drive to Survive</em> saw interest in Formula 1 increase substantially in 2020. According to global analytics company Nielson, an average of 2.7 million 16 to 35-year-olds became interested in F1 every month in the year beginning March 2000.</p>\n<p>Speaking to RMC, Le Bourbouac’h explained how the Tour de France series will differ from <em>Drive to Survive.</em></p>\n<p>“You have to understand that Formula 1 is a championship where you follow one race and then another. You can adjust your narrative arcs. The Tour de France does not wait for you. It’s different work, it’s different stories,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the differences between the two shows, if Netflix’s Tour de France series proves anywhere near as popular as <em>Drive to Survive</em>, there could be a massive increase in interest in the Tour de France and cycling more generally.</p>\n<h2>What is the Tour de France Netflix documentary about?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard battling it out on stage 17 of the 2022 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Marco Bertorello / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Netflix has said its Tour de France series will “follow as closely as possible all the actors of the Tour de France, from cyclists to team managers to understand the multiple stakes of a race”.</p>\n<p>It promises to show the racing but also the ‘backstages’ of the eight teams involved, from how they prepare for the Grand Boucle’s stages to crossing the finish line.</p>\n<p>Yann Le Moënner, director general of A.S.O., says the docuseries will show how the race poses the ‘ultimate challenge’ for its competitors through a narrative approach.</p>\n<p>Laurent-Eric Le Lay, sports director at France Télévisions, says it will “allow everyone to experience part of the daily life of champions and teams”.</p>\n<p>This is not dissimilar to <em>Drive to Survive</em> which, to a certain extent, dramatises the F1 season and provides behind-the-scenes footage fans wouldn’t usually see.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/the-subtle-presence-of-netflix-at-the-2022-tour-de-france/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclingnews</a> has reported that 70 accreditations were issued for filming at the 2022 Tour de France for the series. Each of the eight teams involved is said to have had a dedicated film crew, while a separate crew tried to cover the broader story of the race.</p>\n<h2>Which teams are involved in the Tour de France Netflix documentary?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wout van Aert leading the peloton at the 2022 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Anne-Christine Poujoulat / Getty Images </i></span></div>\n<p>There are eight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour teams</a> involved in the Tour de France Netflix documentary:</p>\n<ul><li>AG2R Citroën Team</li>\n<li>Alpecin-Fenix</li>\n<li>Bora-Hansgrohe</li>\n<li>EF Education-EasyPost</li>\n<li>Groupama-FDJ Cycling Team</li>\n<li>Ineos Grenadiers</li>\n<li>Team Jumbo-Visma</li>\n<li>Team Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl</li>\n</ul><p>The major omission from this list is UAE Team Emirates, the team of Tadej Pogačar, who won the 2021 edition of the race and came second in 2022.</p>\n<p>Team Jumbo-Visma’s inclusion in the documentary will provide insight into winner Jonas Vingegaard’s race. But if UAE Team Emirates and Pogačar were in the documentary we could see how the battle for first and second place played out from both sides.</p>\n<p>One reason why UAE Team Emirates may have opted not to be in the documentary is teams were paid €50,000 to be involved, according to <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/vaughters-supports-asos-tour-de-france-netflix-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclingnews</a>.</p>\n<p>Patrick Lefevere, general manager of Team Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl, described the sum as “peanuts” in Belgian newspaper <a href=\"https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20220304_98110783\" target=\"_blank\">Het Nieuwsblad</a>. UAE Team Emirates may have deemed the cash not enough to justify the disturbance of a film crew to its Tour proceedings.</p>\n<h2>What happened at the 2022 Tour de France?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jonas Vingegaard won the 2022 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Michael Steele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2022 Tour de France was the 109th edition of the race.
