The device is also equipped with a more efficient OLED display, but neither the chip nor the OLED display have resulted in additional battery life. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ has a 31.29-watt-hour battery, up from 28.65‐watt‐hours in the prior-generation model, while the 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ has a 38.99-watt-hour battery, down from 40.88-watt-hours.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the ‌iPad Air‌, the 11-inch model has a 28.93‐watt‐hour, up slightly from the 28.6-watt-hour battery that was in the prior 10.9-inch version. The new 13-inch model has a 36.59‐watt‐hour battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that the ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ models last for up to 10 hours when surfing the web on Wi-Fi or watching video, but that drops to nine hours when surfing the web using a cellular data network.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/\">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-battery-life/\">New 2024 iPads Still Have 10 Hours of Battery Life</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-2024-ipads-still-have-10-hours-of-battery-life.2425678/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4ace9c98c58e5d722f347447bc8eb18c3bcfe0d3367546421a6b15e404533e14","category":"Apple"}
