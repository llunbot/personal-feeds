One extreme class is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter\">ultra-hot Jupiters</a>, of particular interest because they can provide a unique window into planetary atmospheric dynamics. According to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08664-1\">a new paper</a> published in the journal Nature, astronomers have mapped the 3D structure of the layered atmosphere of one such ultra-hot Jupiter-size exoplanet, revealing powerful winds that create intricate weather patterns across that atmosphere. A <a href=\"https://exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Prinoth-et-al.-2025-WASP-121b.pdf\">companion paper</a> published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics reported on the unexpected identification of titanium in the exoplanet's atmosphere as well.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/tess-mission-finds-nearby-3-planet-system-thats-a-perfect-planet-lab/\">previously reported</a>, thanks to the massive trove of exoplanets discovered by the Kepler mission, we now have a good idea of what kinds of planets are out there, where they orbit, and how common the different types are. What we lack is a good sense of what that implies in terms of the conditions on the planets themselves. Kepler can tell us how big a planet is, but it doesn't know what the planet is made of. And planets in the \"habitable zone\" around stars could be consistent with anything from a blazing hell to a frozen rock.</p>\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/04/nasas-new-planet-finder-is-in-space-now-what/\">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a> (TESS), Kepler identifies planets using the transit method. This works for systems in which the planets orbit in a plane that takes them between their host star and Earth. As this occurs, the planet blocks a small fraction of the starlight that we see from Earth (or nearby orbits). If these dips in light occur with regularity, they're diagnostic of something orbiting the star.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/3d-map-of-exoplanet-atmosphere-shows-wacky-climate/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/3d-map-of-exoplanet-atmosphere-shows-wacky-climate/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f106807c7314e7ec19d5fe9954d18c5b149fd39273fd309ff1c796db5a4a8c72","category":"Tech"}
