When I am on my bike, observing the landscape, the skies seem wider and there is a pronounced contrast between the earth and the skies. In this piece, the red earth is illustrated next to blue skies transitioning from day to night with 3 of our native butterflies dancing on the horizon. Within this landscape, Paintbrush flower (also known as Prairie Fire) encircled by fire and smoke, falls toward the prairie grasses below.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-9.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“Nature is profound in its ability to regenerate from what might appear as destruction. Much like the grasslands that depend on fire to break open seeds and enrich the soil, we too are shaped and strengthened through moments of upheaval. This gift, passed along to us by the earth itself, reminds us that what may seem chaotic or destructive can actually be the catalyst required for something new to come through. Remember this wisdom from our mother when you become overwhelmed by the environment around you: Acts of destruction only nurture the forces of creation.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mid-South-Salsa-Stormchaser-2025-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Check out more and buy some raffle tickets at <a href=\"https://www.midsouthgravel.com/shop/p/wley9hlw38ft4atkxw1os82y7tsj0w-frl9p\" target=\"_blank\">Mid-South</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mid-south-custom-salsa-stormchaser/\">A Look at the Mid-South Custom “Prairie Fire” Salsa Stormchaser</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e2a13def46e8b4cbd283ca9b8e9d56aa2b966e8c7b82da02eef1dd07bd1e3c71","category":"Cycling"}
