The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE) <a href=\"https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-core-first-u-s-unionized-apple-retail-store-workers-reach-historic-tentative-labor-agreement-with-tech-giant/\">announced the deal</a> on Friday, detailing improvements in pay, work-life balance, and job security. This agreement is now pending a vote by the store's approximately 85 employees on August 6.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe proposed three-year contract includes an average pay raise of 10%, with increases in starting pay for 80% of job classifications. The agreement aims to improve work-life balance through enhanced scheduling protections for both full-time and part-time employees. The deal also includes limits on the use of contracted employees, a new transparency and accountability procedure for disciplinary action, and an updated severance clause to provide financial protection in the event of layoffs. The tentative agreement maintains all current benefits and includes a commitment to negotiate any future additions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Towson Apple store made headlines in June 2022 when its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/18/apple-store-officially-joins-union/\">employees voted to join IAM</a>, becoming the first Apple retail store in the United States to unionize. Since then, IAM CORE has been in negotiations with Apple management, with discussions starting in January 2023. Frustration over the slow pace of negotiations led to a strike authorization vote in May 2024. The Towson store agreement may set a precedent for labor negotiations at other Apple retail locations and could potentially influence unionization efforts across the company's 271 U.S. stores. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/\">United States</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-finalizes-first-retail-union-contract/\">Apple Finalizes First Retail Union Contract With Maryland Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-finalizes-first-retail-union-contract-with-maryland-store.2432440/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2d12c2286bd225234da069298d90e9926d9dee01daa4f257d9da933d2c1afc77","category":"Apple"}
