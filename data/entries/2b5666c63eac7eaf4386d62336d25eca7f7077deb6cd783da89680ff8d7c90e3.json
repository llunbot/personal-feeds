Languages as different as English, Russian, Hindustani, Latin and Sanskrit can all be traced back to this ancestral language.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple of hundred years, linguists have figured out a lot about that first Indo-European language, including many of the words it used and some of the grammatical rules that governed it. Along the way, theyâ€™ve come up with theories about who its original speakers were, where and how they lived, and how their language spread so widely.</p>\n<p>Most linguists think that those speakers were nomadic herders who lived on the steppes of Ukraine and western Russia about 6,000 years ago. Yet a minority put the origin 2,000 to 3,000 years before that, with a community of farmers in Anatolia, in the area of modern-day Turkey. Now a new analysis, using techniques borrowed from evolutionary biology, has come down in favor of the latter, albeit with an important later role for the steppes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003243#p3\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003243&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2b5666c63eac7eaf4386d62336d25eca7f7077deb6cd783da89680ff8d7c90e3","category":"Tech"}
