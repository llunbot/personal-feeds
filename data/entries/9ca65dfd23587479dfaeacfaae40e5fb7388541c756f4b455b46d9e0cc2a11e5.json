The long-awaited device has been  rumored for years now, but signs increasingly suggest that 2026 could indeed be the year that Apple releases its first foldable device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Homescreen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we've collated the key details that have been leaked about Apple's foldable iPhone so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Overall Design</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Book-Style</span><br />\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple's foldable iPhone is similar in style to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold, which uses a book-style folding mechanism, rather than the clamshell design of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> expects the foldable ‌iPhone‌ to measure between 9 and 9.5 mm when folded, and around 4.5 to 4.8 mm when unfolded.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Display Sizes</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Dual Screens</span><br />\r<br />\nWhen folded, users will interact with a 5.5-inch outer display that is similar to a typical iPhone screen, while unfolding it will reveal a larger 7.8-inch iPad-style screen. The inner display is said to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apple-2026-foldable-phone-has-no-crease/\">virtually crease-free</a>. These dimensions have been corroborated by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/\">two</a> reputable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">sources</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Chassis and Hinge</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Durable Materials</span><br />\r<br />\nThe foldable iPhone reportedly has a titanium chassis, with the hinge constructed from a combination of titanium and stainless steel, <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">according to Kuo</a>. Apple is said to be using liquid metal in the hinges to improve durability and help eliminate screen creasing. Liquid metal, manufactured using a die-casting process, has been chosen by Apple to address these two common issues with foldable devices, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/apple-liquid-metal-foldable-iphone-hinges/\">according to the analyst</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Cameras</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Front and Rear</span><br />\r<br />\nThe foldable iPhone is expected to include a dual-lens rear camera, with a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states, <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">according to Kuo</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Authentication</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Touch ID</span><br />\r<br />\nKuo believes the phone will <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">forgo Face ID authentication</a>, and instead use a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. Apple has previously integrated Touch ID into the side button of the iPad, iPad Air, and iPad mini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Battery Life</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>High-Density Cells</span><br />\r<br />\nApple is putting a heavy focus on improving power efficiency by slimming down key components like the display driver to make room for more battery cells, according to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/\">Korean blog</a> that has leaked accurate details about unreleased products before. The phone will reportedly use <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">high-density battery cells</a> – the same ones that Kuo believes will be used in Apple's upcoming ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Pricing</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Premium Segment</span><br />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/foldable-iphone-price-estimate/\">Multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">reports</a> suggest the foldable iPhone will be priced between $2,000 and $2,500 in the United States, which could make it the most expensive iPhone ever. Despite the price, the foldable is expected to tap into Apple's loyal fanbase, some of whom will view it as a \"must-have device\" if its quality meets expectations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Launch Date</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Late 2026</span><br />\r<br />\nAccording to industry analyst Jeff Pu, the device is said to have recently entered the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/\">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn. An exact launch date is currently unknown, but both Kuo and Pu say mass production is planned for the second half of 2026. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-expected-2026-rumored-features/\">Foldable iPhone Expected Next Year: All the Rumored Features So Far</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-expected-next-year-all-the-rumored-features-so-far.2453971/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ca65dfd23587479dfaeacfaae40e5fb7388541c756f4b455b46d9e0cc2a11e5","category":"Apple"}
