Twitter\nmade one massive impression and changed the way we communicate.\nNow, X will go further, transforming the global town square.</p>\n\n<p>X is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in\naudio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global\nmarketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered\nby AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to\nimagine.</p>\n\n<p>For years, fans and critics alike have pushed Twitter to dream\nbigger, to innovate faster, and to fulfill our great potential. X\nwill do that and more. We’ve already started to see X take shape\nover the past 8 months through our rapid feature launches, but\nwe’re just getting started.</p>\n\n<p>There’s absolutely no limit to this transformation. X will be the\nplatform that can deliver, well … everything. @elonmusk and I are\nlooking forward to working with our teams and every single one of\nour partners to bring X to the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/t/CvDi-7SPuha/\">Nilay Patel, on Threads</a>, reminds me where I’ve heard similar rhetoric before:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the\nInformation Purification Directive. We have created for the first\ntime in all history a garden of pure ideology, where each worker\nmay bloom secure from the pests of contradictory and confusing\ntruths. Our Unification of Thought is more powerful a weapon than\nany fleet or army on earth. We are one people, with one will, one\nresolve, one cause. Our enemies shall talk themselves to death and\nwe will bury them with their own confusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/24/yaccarino\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"58ad8b0bc7938731a75aa579530080d6b31b595a61190e17b3dd26318018de4e","category":"Tech"}
