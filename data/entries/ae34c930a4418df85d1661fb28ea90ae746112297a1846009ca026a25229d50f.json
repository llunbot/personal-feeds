That's according to a press release posted Friday by the company; the full data has not yet been released, published, or peer-reviewed.</p>\n<p>Still, Pfizer said the results looked promising enough that an independent data-monitoring committee recommended the trial end early. Pfizer said it now plans to submit its data as soon as possible to the Food and Drug Administration for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</p>\n<p>Pfizer's oral antiviral—PF-07321332—is the second drug candidate to generate buzz as an easy-to-use and highly effective COVID-19 treatment. Last month, Merck announced that its oral antiviral treatment, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/meet-molnupiravir-mercks-thor-inspired-pill-that-hammers-covid/\">molnupiravir, cut the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 by roughly 50 percent</a> in newly infected, at-risk people. Merck has applied for an EUA, and FDA advisers <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-hold-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-merck-and-ridgebacks-eua-application-covid-19-oral\">will review the application on November 30</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810678#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810678&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae34c930a4418df85d1661fb28ea90ae746112297a1846009ca026a25229d50f","category":"Tech"}
