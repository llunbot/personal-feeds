The 57-year-old still lives locally, and now spends his days <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cobbles-and-lions-flanders-big-ride\" target=\"_blank\">leading tour groups</a> – as opposed to the pro peloton – across the region’s cobbles and old farm roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw rode the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Flanders</a> every year he raced as a pro. His first victory in 1993 established him as a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a> specialist. He would win it three times in all and finished on the podium on a further five occasions. Then there is his hat-trick of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/paris-roubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix</a> titles, but we’ll come to that in part two of our Holy Week preview.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Johan Museeuw always has been and always will be at home on the cobbles</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, who better to ask than the Lion of Flanders when it comes to splitting the three favourites for the men’s Ronde? Spoiler alert: it’s not who you might think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We speak at the photoshoot for Le Col’s Lion of Flanders collection. One jersey, based on Museeuw’s status as a national treasure, is black, with a Belgian flag across the pockets and subtle streaks of mud and rain detailed on the front; the other, in blue and white, a nod to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-jerseys-no5-mapei\" target=\"_blank\">Mapei’s</a> 1996 podium clean sweep and Museeuw’s first Paris-Roubaix win. Brilliantly, the main man also asks for an additional custom jersey in black with the world champion’s rainbow bands so people will recognise him better. ‘White is for the world champions for now,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a few days before <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclist/status/1639302558073200641?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert would defend his E3 Saxo Classic title</a> in a three-up sprint with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/v-is-for-victory-mathieu-van-der-poel-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> and Tadej Pogačar, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclist/status/1640012260415340544?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma’s dominant one-two at Gent-Wevelgem</a> last Wednesday, when Van Aert allowed Christophe Laporte to roll across the line ahead of him. That all sets the scene for Sunday’s Tour of Flanders, which begins in Bruges for the first time since 2016 and finishes 273.4km later in Oudenaarde after what we hope will be fireworks on the final turn of the Kwaremont and Paterberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to win the Tour of Flanders</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Can you tell he’s Belgian?</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There are not so many secrets to winning Flanders,’ says Museeuw, insisting Pogačar, Van Aert and Van der Poel absolutely meet the criteria to contest the final for this year’s race. ‘You have to be a good rider who is strong past 230km, 240km. It starts with that. You have to like cobblestones, of course. You have to be a little bit clever. And you have to be a killer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Pogačar is not really a rider you’d say would be a Tour of Flanders winner. But he will come very close. Two years ago, no one would have said he could do it. Now he comes to win. I hope he rides differently to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-2022-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a> [when he came fourth in the sprint behind Van der Poel, Dylan van Baarle and Valentin Madouas]. Because last year he was <em>pffft</em>, up the Oude Kwarement too early, full gas. That’s what I mean about being clever, eh? If he rides clever, then why not? And why not, they go as three to the finish? Pogačar, Van Aert and Van der Poel.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth underlining here that Museeuw called this before E3 happened. But he says it’s not just about having the raw power to go long, as the three amigos are wont to do:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sometimes we think they don’t think. But they think, also. They open much earlier because they know they can. They have more watts in their legs, and that’s how they see the race. So they open earlier than when we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Pogačar, Van Aert and Van der Poel all have something in here [their gut], very clever. And you have to be very clever here [points to his head], otherwise you always lose. A champion is starting in his gut, and ending in his head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was a rider that always tried to save energy, wait, and when the moment is there [he claps his hands together emphatically]. They don’t know when the moment is [until it comes]. It can be 70km, 80km, or 5km – they don’t know it. If you said to me: “You have to open 100km from the finish”, it’s too early. For them, it’s not. The level is higher. But when they’re riding like that, it’s beautiful for cycling.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is under the most pressure to win?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Can you tell he’s Belgian?</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw says the pressure is off for Van der Poel after he emulated his grandfather Raymond Poulidor in winning Milan-San Remo: ‘Mathieu already has his Monument for the season. He’s in another position. No stress. He can follow [the other two]. Let them do it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the Dutchman is looking to draw level with the Lion’s Flanders hat-trick, whereas Van Aert is in the hunt for his first. And that brings a pressure unique to Flandrians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He will peak for the Holy Week,’ says Museeuw of his countryman. ‘It is like this: it’s a shame, but if they don’t win in the Holy Week, it’s not okay. Even if they won a couple of races before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I hope for him he wins a Flanders or Roubaix, because he’s such a great rider; he is not just a Classics rider, he can win everywhere. But it’s so lovely to win Flanders or Roubaix. His level is exceptional. And that was the case for Greg Van Avermaet, but we have to say: he won just one Roubaix. That’s not enough. You see Tom Boonen was four times Roubaix, three times Flanders. It’s a big gap, eh?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which race does he think is more important to Van Aert?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-Johan-Museeuw-Flanders-5-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>The look of someone who is about to have their Belgian citizenship rescinded</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you’re talking about around the world, I have to say Roubaix,’ says Museeuw. ‘But I am from here. So it’s dangerous to say, for me. I am not involved with a team anymore, and I can say what I am thinking. Whether it is right or not right. Mud, slippery cobbles, crashes, punctures, coming back, a long breakaway. People like things like that. There is just one race like Roubaix. And there is just one Tour of Flanders. Are they similar? Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People ask me: “What’s the difference?” Roubaix, the cobblestones are flat. And very long. And very rough. Flanders, the cobbles are always up, and 300m, 500m, maybe 1km. Most of the time, riders can do it in a sprint.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exception, of course, is the Kwaremont. At 2.2km it is Flanders’ longest ascent, with a maximum gradient of 11.6% but an average of 4%. The Ronde covers 19 key climbs in total, which includes the Kwaremont three times and the Paterberg twice. The first, the Korte Ast, comes 114.7km into the race. The second ascent of the Paterberg is the final climb, with 13.3km to go. There is again no place for the Muur van Geraardsbergen, otherwise known as the Kapelmuur for the little chapel at the top. ‘That’s a hill with a lot of history,’ says Museeuw. ‘The people from there aren’t happy with that.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paterberg-tour-of-flanders-classic-climb\">The Paterberg: The Tour of Flanders’ instant classic</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oude-kwaremont-climb\">Classic climb: Oude Kwaremont</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Flanders 2023: All you need to know including route, how to watch, start list, history and sportive</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>He returns to his Roubaix comparison. ‘[Flanders is] going up, going down again. Turning into the wind. Turning all the time. Flanders is more intervals. You can’t ride intervals in Roubaix. The sectors are too long: 4.5km, 5km. You have to be controlled on the bike, sitting down, with your weight on the back wheel. That’s also the reason that riders who are a little bit older can still win Roubaix. It takes a big engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The body suffers more in Roubaix, but the problem with Flanders also is that you have to be always in the front – the whole day. That makes the race stressful.’ Though it is possible to come from behind, as Museeuw reminds us: he was once nearly three minutes off the front after he crashed in 1998, and still came back to win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ronde is a far less tense affair for him these days. ‘I’ll go out and have breakfast with a friend. Then I go to the hospitality area. I’ve stopped trying to go everywhere and do too much, because it feels like I’m in a race again. I want to enjoy the day. It’s still a little bit my day.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does he have a beer with breakfast to celebrate? ‘I’m not really a beer drinker. It’s strange if you say that in Belgium. It will be champagne.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Johan Museeuw’s Tour of Flanders prediction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Pogačar will win Flanders in a sprint of two. Against Van der Poel or Van Aert.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le Col’s Lion of Flanders collection will be available from 2nd April at <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">lecol.cc</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-johan-museeuw\">Johan Museeuw’s Tour of Flanders preview: How to win De Ronde and 2023 predictions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"021117ce515ff7a75cf70206b078947cc8d3f0f77d831cc936e507d02b7e3938","category":"Cycling"}
