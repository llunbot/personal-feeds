The display is also capable of reducing brightness to as low as 1 nits.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome Ultra 2 owners have pinned the blame on this new hardware specification, however the recent uptick in reports also includes users of the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra, suggesting it is an issue with Apple's watchOS 10 software update, which was released in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers say the issue is particularly pronounced when quickly moving from a bright room to a dark area, and when the Wayfinder and Ultra Modular watch face is set to Night mode, which puts a red filter on the display. Legibility issues persist despite manual adjustments to the brightness level in the watch's Settings. Both Ultra and Ultra 2 owners say the problem is evident on models updated with watchOS 10.0.1 and the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-2/\">watchOS 10.0.2 update</a>. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-watch-ultra-how-to-activate-night-mode/\">Apple Watch Ultra: How to Activate Night Mode</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple is reportedly aware of the issue, so hopefully a future software update will remedy the situation.
