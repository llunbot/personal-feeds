And perhaps most glaringly, 76 percent of experts believe these technologies will benefit them personally rather than harm them (15 percent).</p>\n<p>The public does not share this confidence. Only about 11 percent of the public says that \"they are more excited than concerned about the increased use of AI in daily life.\" They're much more likely (51 percent) to say they're more concerned than excited, whereas only 15 percent of experts shared that pessimism. Unlike the majority of experts, just 24 percent of the public thinks AI will be good for them, whereas nearly half the public anticipates they will be personally harmed by AI.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/survey-americans-fear-ai-will-hurt-them-experts-expect-the-opposite/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/survey-americans-fear-ai-will-hurt-them-experts-expect-the-opposite/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b50643f08e612c00e131a9fcc223ae643805db0e51442cb70366a2e6c2a08990","category":"Tech"}
