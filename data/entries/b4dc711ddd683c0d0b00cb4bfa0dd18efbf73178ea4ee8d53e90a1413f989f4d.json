The monitor has not been updated since, but there have been rumors about a new model being in the works.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Pro-Display-XDR-Yella.jpg\" width=\"2590\" height=\"1456\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we recap all of the rumors about a potential next-generation Pro Display XDR so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Pro Display XDR</h2>\r<br />\nIn December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/\">working on multiple new monitors</a>, including an updated Pro Display XDR equipped with an Apple silicon chip. Apple's lower-priced Studio Display has an A13 Bionic chip that enables features like Center Stage, spatial audio, and \"Siri\"/\"Hey Siri\" voice commands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn July 2023, Gurman reiterated that Apple was still working on multiple next-generation monitors for release in 2024 at the very earliest. He said at least one of these monitors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/gurman-apple-monitor-smart-home-display/\">could double as a smart home display</a> in a low-power state.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile no other features have been rumored yet for the next Pro Display XDR, some additions that customers are hoping for include a webcam, speakers, and a higher refresh rate. The current model features a 32-inch screen with LED backlighting, a 6K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current Pro Display XDR starts at $4,999 in the U.S., but the Pro Stand costs $999 extra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Larger iMac</h2>\r<br />\nWhile it would be a different product, the rumored 32-inch iMac would have some similarities to the Pro Display XDR, including the same display size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg\" width=\"1626\" height=\"914\" />\r<br />\nIn October 2023, both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/\">developing a 32-inch iMac for release in late 2024 or in 2025</a>. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/\">would feature mini-LED backlighting</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following month, Apple confirmed that it has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/\">no plans to release a 27-inch iMac with an Apple silicon chip</a>. Apple discontinued the Intel-based 27-inch iMac in March 2022. For customers who want a large-screened desktop setup, Apple has recommended pairing the 27-inch Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini. Apple did not explicitly rule out the possibility of a 32-inch iMac being released in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the meantime, the 24-inch iMac was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/27/m3-imac-review/\">recently updated with the M3 chip</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/next-pro-display-xdr-rumor-recap/\">Pro Display XDR Turns Four Years Old: When to Expect a New Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pro-display-xdr-turns-four-years-old-when-to-expect-a-new-model.2413301/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4dc711ddd683c0d0b00cb4bfa0dd18efbf73178ea4ee8d53e90a1413f989f4d","category":"Apple"}
