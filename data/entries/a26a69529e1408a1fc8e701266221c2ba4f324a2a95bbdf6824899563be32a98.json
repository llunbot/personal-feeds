She suggested that Facebook should not be responsible for content that users post on its platforms but that it should be held liable once its algorithms begin making decisions about which content people see.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801618#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801618&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a26a69529e1408a1fc8e701266221c2ba4f324a2a95bbdf6824899563be32a98","category":"Tech"}
