Tire pressure is a huge part of dialing in your cyclocross setup: Too much and you’ll slide out in corners, too little and you run the risk of pinch-flatting as you ride over a root. And we’re literally talking half a PSI…small changes make a huge difference.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051LQ0X4/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Topeak’s digital pressure gauge</a> is a great tool to have before, during, and after a pre-ride lap of the course. Check your pressure before you head out for a lap, and if you stop to let the air out during your lap, check again to see where you end up. This will help you dial in your tire pressure ‘sweet spot’ for each course—it will vary depending on the course conditions and tires, so don’t just decide that 28 PSI is your go-to pressure for every race.</p><ul><li>MSRP: $39</li></ul><h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYFWA6Q/?tag=20br-20\"><span>&nbsp;SKS Twenty-Niner Floor Pump&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111902/sks-twentyniner-mountain-bike-floor-pump.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111902/sks-twentyniner-mountain-bike-floor-pump.jpg\" alt=\"sks twentyniner is one of the best floor pumps for mountain bikes gravel bikes and cyclocross bikes\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111902/sks-twentyniner-mountain-bike-floor-pump.jpg 500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111902/sks-twentyniner-mountain-bike-floor-pump-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111902/sks-twentyniner-mountain-bike-floor-pump-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111902/sks-twentyniner-mountain-bike-floor-pump-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></a></p><p>On the note of tire pressure, a pump that can get pretty darn specific with proper PSI is also a must. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYFWA6Q/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SKS TwentyNiner pump</a> is actually one of the best pumps for filling big tires quickly and to a very specific PSI. The larger barrel blasts more air into your tubes and tires with each pump. (It can even help seat tubeless tires with relative ease, if you’re running a tubeless CX setup.)</p><p>Because it’s designed primarily for mountain bike tires that will run lower tire pressures, the gauge only goes up to 73 PSI. That makes it easier to see exactly what pressure you’re at, and the narrow range makes it more accurate. The PSI readings below 30 are some of the most accurate we’ve seen on a regular pump, which is why the SKS TwentyNiner pump is our pick for cyclocross, where many riders are running 22-37 PSI. At those ranges, even 0.5 PSI can make a big difference, so having a pump that works well in that range is key. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/07/best-bike-pumps/\">(Check out more great bike pump options here.)</a></p><ul><li>MSRP: $50</li></ul><h3><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F101546%2Ffeedback-sports-omnium-portable-bike-trainer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>&nbsp;Feedback Sports Omnium Over-Drive Portable Trainer&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110132/feedback-omnium-best-cyclocross-accessories-1536x1005.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a><br>We love the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F101546%2Ffeedback-sports-omnium-portable-bike-trainer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feedback Omnium Portable Trainer</a> for cyclocross ease thanks to the combination of rollers with a front wheel mount. It’s easy to pop a cyclocross bike onto to quickly warm up at a race, with just enough resistance to make you sweaty. While some riders swear by rollers or prefer a direct drive trainer, we’ve found that this is one of the best family-friendly options since a wide range of bikes can fit on it with minimal adaptors requires. Because the front wheel is the one being mounted, it’s a simple shift to go from quick release to thru axle, without any cassette or cog swaps.</p><p>At only 14 pounds and with a tidy travel case, this is the easiest trainer to slip into the car or even carry on if you’re flying to your race.

It’s also just a great way to carry extra water to the race: Many venues don’t have hoses on site, so this extra five gallons can refill water bottles or your mini-bike wash setup.</p><ul><li>MSRP: $21</li></ul><h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073F5X9DD/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>&nbsp;KingCamp Moon Saucer Leisure Heavy Duty Steel Camping Chair&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"872\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories-297x162.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories-800x436.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories-120x65.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories-768x419.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14110125/big-comfy-camp-chair-best-cyclocross-accessories-1536x837.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>You’re exhausted post-race but your kids are racing, or you want to stick around for the elite races.

You don’t want those. They won’t last a season, and one strong wind will probably fold them like a tin can. And then they’re landfill fodder. Spend the coin (about $220-$240) for an actual <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QBUCEW/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EZ-UP tent</a>, and get the commercial ones – they’re made to take abuse and last event after event. Buy it once, use it for years, and make sure to get the one with the sidewalls because those will block freezing wind (and snow and rain) and help trap heat.</p><p>For the space heater, don’t try to sort out an electric one. Bring your 13-gallon propane tank from your grill and mount the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00823W9B0/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mr. Heater 30,000 BTU portable propane heater</a> to it.

And because most races are doubles—racing both Saturday and Sunday—and require a fair amount of pre-riding, which means you’re at the course for hours before your race, it’s important to think through each day from start to finish, not just start line to finish line.</p><p>How early do you need to be there to pre-ride twice, when pre-ride windows are short and between other races? Do you want to stay to watch the elite races and hang out with friends? Suddenly, that JetBoil seems more reasonable now that you realize you’ll be at the course from 9 AM to 5 PM!</p><p><strong>Consider variable weather conditions.</strong> For some people, cyclocross is a fair-weather sport. You race the early races in September and October, and if temperatures drop or it gets muddy outside, you skip the race. That’s a totally valid way to race cyclocross, but it means you likely can get away with not needing bike and body washing tools or embrocation. On the other hand, if you’ll race in any condition and thrive in the cold muddy races, then those tools will be extremely helpful.</p><p>Think body and bike. Cyclocross is as hard on your gear as it is on your body.</p><div id=\"attachment_248294\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-248294\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-2-2020-15513929-cxworlds-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-248294\">Watching the Elites/Pros is fun, unless you’re miserably cold.

We recommend starting around 27 PSI for a preride lap and paying attention to how your tires hook up in grassy corners, and if you feel your wheel’s rim whenever you hit any roots or rocks. If you’re sliding out in corners, let out a small amount of air. If you’re bottoming out, add a bit. Use a notebook to keep track of what PSI works for you on different types of courses. And remember, don’t just copy what your friend is doing: You may be heavier than he is, or you might be running tubeless while he’s running tubular tires.</p><p><strong>What do I need for pre-race?</strong><br>Pre-race and all the way to the start line, you want to focus on having your bike and body dialed in as much as possible. That’s where things like a digital pressure gauge to perfect your tire pressure come in handy for your bike, while embrocation can help make your legs feel warmer. And of course, having some plan for warming up is critical: Because cyclocross races start fast and furious, you don’t want to go to the start line still cold.</p><div id=\"attachment_273284\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30160200/travel-chair-camp-stool-makes-a-great-bike-maintenance-stool.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-273284\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30160200/travel-chair-camp-stool-makes-a-great-bike-maintenance-stool.jpg\" alt=\"travel chair camp stool\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30160200/travel-chair-camp-stool-makes-a-great-bike-maintenance-stool.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30160200/travel-chair-camp-stool-makes-a-great-bike-maintenance-stool-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30160200/travel-chair-camp-stool-makes-a-great-bike-maintenance-stool-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30160200/travel-chair-camp-stool-makes-a-great-bike-maintenance-stool-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30160200/travel-chair-camp-stool-makes-a-great-bike-maintenance-stool-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-273284\">The Travel Chair camp stool is the perfect height for working on your bike, then just sling it over your shoulder to walk the course.</p></div><p><strong>What do I need for post-race?</strong><br>Think about getting warm, clean and dry ASAP. Counterintuitively, this can include a cool-down, since you don’t want to go from 100 percent effort to zero, otherwise you’ll end up shivering and feeling funky. So take a few minutes to cool down by riding easy, then head to the car and focus on getting yourself out of your wet, dirty clothes and into dry, warm ones. Get changed (using your changing robe), then</p><p><strong>How do I apply embrocation?</strong><br>Use embrocation sparingly, a little goes a long way. Make sure you’re already wearing the skinsuit or bike shorts you’re planning to race in before applying it, then apply a thin layer to the parts of your legs that are still exposed. Don’t get too high on your legs, because you really, <em>really</em> do not want to get embrocation in any ‘sensitive areas.’ Pro tip: invest in some latex gloves or use a sandwich baggie over your hand when applying in order to avoid your hand getting covered with embrocation.</p><p><strong>Do I need all the stuff on this list?</strong><br>Of course not! But it’s nice to have. If you’re on a budget, you can likely use a lot of what you already have around the house to make race day smoother. These are just our favorite gear suggestions that have served us well over the years—two Bikerumor staffers not only have raced elite-level cyclocross, we’ve coached it for years as well, and one of us spent three years in Europe managing a professional cyclocross team. We know racing—and we know how easy it is to get cold, wet, and grumpy on race day if you don’t have the right setup.</p></section></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b57f32e9cfcb08ef22f3e754c18381974aa8561412f9765ff7105cc270cc73c7","category":"Cycling"}
