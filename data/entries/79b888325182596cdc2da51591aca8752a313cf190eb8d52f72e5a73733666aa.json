Apple said it is \"aware of this issue\" and will fix it in a \"future macOS update.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Red.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWhile the Mac Pro is configured with SSD storage, it has SATA ports for connecting internal hard drives, and some can disconnect due to a bug.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Certain models of internal SATA drives might unexpectedly disconnect from your computer after your Mac wakes from sleep,\" said Apple. \"This can occur if your Mac automatically goes to sleep or if you manually put your Mac to sleep. If you see a message that your disk was not ejected properly, you can restart your Mac to reconnect to the drive.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a temporary workaround, users can prevent their Mac Pro from automatically going to sleep by opening the System Settings app, clicking on Displays → Advanced…, and turning on \"Prevent automatic sleeping when the display is off.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased on Tuesday, the new Mac Pro features Apple's M2 Ultra chip. The desktop tower has the same design as the Intel-based model from 2019, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/11/apple-exec-discusses-mac-pro-lack-of-egpu-support/\">lacks graphics card support</a> and user-upgradeable RAM due to Apple silicon's unified architecture.
