But in a recently published 2024 <a href=\"https://investor.tsmc.com/sites/ir/annual-report/2024/2024%20Annual%20Report_E.pdf\">report</a>, TSMC confirmed that its \"role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits its visibility and information available to it regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by it.\"</p>\n<p>Essentially, TSMC expects that it plays too big a role in the semiconductor industry to stop all the possible unintended end-uses of the semiconductors it manufactures. Similarly, it appears impossible to track all the third parties determined to skirt sanctions. And if TSMC's hands are truly tied, that ultimately means that the US can't effectively stop the latest AI tech from trickling into China.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-cant-keep-china-from-getting-ai-chips-tsmc-suggests/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-cant-keep-china-from-getting-ai-chips-tsmc-suggests/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"210ed3e38dc76169e0d5e026be221066c905b781b9ea292dee0850ca256fde4b","category":"Tech"}
