So, we set out to find a partner sponsor and a crew of committed filmmakers to direct and produce a feature-length documentary film. With the support of <a href=\"https://poc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">POC Sports</a>, <a href=\"https://justinbalog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Balog</a> on camera, <a href=\"https://www.christophermotta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Motta</a> in the editing bay, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jweinberg/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Weinberg</a> in the director’s chair, the trailer you see above previews a passion project years in the making.</p>\n<p><img width=\"1512\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/CameraCorner_Book_GIF.gif?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>CAMERA CORNER the Photobook Pre-Order (<a href=\"https://wendecraggcameracornerbook.myshopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>)</h3>\n<p>Wende has been asked to make a photobook showcasing her work for years, and as part of debuting the Camera Corner film, we’re finally making it happen. But we need your help. Producing and printing a high-quality book is labor-intensive and expensive. So, we’re launching a pre-order to help us meet the minimum order from the printer we have partnered with.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-4.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-4.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-6.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-6.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Wende-Cragg-6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>While Wende’s photography has been featured in plenty of printed publications, this book, <a href=\"https://wendecraggcameracornerbook.myshopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Camera Corner</a> will feature a curated selection of never-before-seen photos scanned and post-processed to modern standards.

In it, she details her involvement in Marin County’s early mountain bike scene, where riders evolved the sport from using found objects to purpose-built machines right before her eyes—and camera lens. She poetically describes how her love for cycling and the mountain bike led her to document the early pioneers of the sport she happened to be riding with. The resulting collection, the Rolling Dinosaur Archive, is a treasure trove of history and some of the only photographic evidence from this pivotal time in cycling.</p>\n<h3>Camera Corner Credits</h3>\n<p><em><strong>A Radavist Films and Shared Territory Production</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Director</strong><br />\nJosh Weinberg</p>\n<p><strong>Executive Producers</strong><br />\nJohn Watson<br />\nCari Carmean<br />\nJosh Weinberg</p>\n<p><strong>Director of Photography</strong><br />\nJustin Balog</p>\n<p><strong>Editor</strong><br />\nChris Motta</p>\n<p><strong>VFX/Animations</strong><br />\nChris McNally</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br />\nScott Mitchell</p>\n<p><strong>Color Correction by Roast n’ Post</strong><br />\nPost Producer: Crystal Villamayor<br />\nSupervising Colorist: Sean Wells<br />\nColorist: Calvin Luu<br />\nColor Assist: Rachel Valdivia</p>\n<p><strong>Art Direction</strong><br />\nCari Carmean</p>\n<p><strong>Production Crew</strong><br />\nLocation Sound recorders: Garret McDonald, Marshall Potter, and Chris Camacho<br />\nCrested Butte Camera Operator: Jesse Levine, Reel Motion Media<br />\nGaffer: Cyrus Amini</p>\n<p><strong>Appearing in the film</strong><br />\nWende Cragg<br />\nDenise Caramagno<br />\nJacquie Phelan<br />\nCharlie Kelly<br />\nJoe Breeze<br />\nGary Fisher<br />\nMarc Vendetti<br />\nOtis Guy<br />\nHowie Hammerman<br />\nDon Koski<br />\nCharlie Cunningham<br />\nVictor Vincente of America<br />\nKilpatrick Will<br />\nJosh Weinberg<br />\nJustin Balog</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/camera-corner-wende-cragg-film-book-announcement/\">*Feature Film and Photobook Announcement* Camera Corner: Wende Cragg Documents the Birth of Mountain Biking</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"3fffeab3bb590fa85ce310d3f9529c45f9161f807eb25c96f2b0207b439344f0","category":"Cycling"}
