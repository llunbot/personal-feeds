Lewis</a> is best known for his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia\"><em>Chronicles of Narnia</em></a>, but Lewis's prolific <em>oeuvre</em> also included a science fiction trilogy, an allegorical novel, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till_We_Have_Faces\">marvelous retelling</a> of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, various nonfiction works of Christian apologetics, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107604702/?tag=arstech20-20\">literary criticism</a>. Now, a literary scholar has discovered a previously unknown short poem by Lewis among a cache of documents acquired by the University of Leeds ten years ago. Written in 1935, the poem has been published for the first time, with an <a href=\"https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/10.3366/ink.2024.0216\">accompanying analysis</a> in the Journal of Inkling Studies.</p>\n<p>The journal's title refers to the so-called \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inklings\">Oxford Inklings</a>,\" a group of Oxford-based scholars and writers who met regularly to read each others' works aloud, most often at an Oxford pub called The Eagle and Child (aka the Bird and the Baby). In addition to Lewis, the group included J.R.R. Tolkien and Charles Williams. (All three were the main characters of James A. Owens' fantasy series, <em><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/series/Chronicles-of-the-Imaginarium-Geographica-The\">The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica</a></em>.) I <a href=\"https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2006/05/random_walks_na.html\">once called</a> the Inklings \"arguably the literary mythmakers\" of their generation.</p>\n<p>Lewis and Tolkien in particular shared a love of Norse mythology, and Lewis read the first early drafts of what would become Tolkien's <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. Tolkien later said he owed his friend \"an unpayable debt\" for convincing him the \"stuff\" could be more than merely a \"private hobby.\" Tolkien, in turn, was the one who convinced Lewis—an atheist in his youth—to convert to Christianity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019330#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019330&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77bc4b36d924d693811848941e7214268f30713ba0e6bf6a98bd1352ecb543c5","category":"Tech"}
