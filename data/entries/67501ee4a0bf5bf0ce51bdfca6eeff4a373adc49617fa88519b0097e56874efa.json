AlexNet served as a watershed moment in AI because it could accurately identify objects in photographs with unprecedented accuracyâ€”correctly classifying images into one of 1,000 categories like \"strawberry,\" \"school bus,\" or \"golden retriever\" with significantly fewer errors than previous systems.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-that-sparked-the-ai-boom/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-that-sparked-the-ai-boom/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"67501ee4a0bf5bf0ce51bdfca6eeff4a373adc49617fa88519b0097e56874efa","category":"Tech"}
