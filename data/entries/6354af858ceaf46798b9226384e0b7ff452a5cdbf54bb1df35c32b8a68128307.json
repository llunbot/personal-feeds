After obtaining the cryptographic hashes for 551 user accounts on the network, the attackers were able to convert half into plaintext passwords, likely through password-cracking techniques and the use of an advanced credential-stealing feature built into the malware. From there, the attackers used the servers to send spam and carry out other nefarious activities. The four servers were likely infected and disinfected at different times, with the last two being remediated at some point in 2011.</p>\n<h2>Stealing kernel.org’s keys to the kingdom</h2>\n<p>An infection of kernel.org <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2011/08/31/linux_kernel_security_breach/\">came to light</a> in 2011, when kernel maintainers revealed that 448 accounts had been compromised after attackers had somehow managed to gain unfettered, or “root,” system access to servers connected to the domain.
