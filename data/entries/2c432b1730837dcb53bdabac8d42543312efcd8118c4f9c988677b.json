Both models are available in sizes S-XL.</p>\n<p>The Gram costs £6,990 / €7,490, while the flagship Gram RC with premium components costs £8,990 / €9,900.</p>\n<p>The Gram’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">geometry</a> is intended to back up its enduro intentions and should offer an efficient climbing position paired with a confidence-inspiring stance on the descents.</p>\n<h2>Flamboyant frame technologies</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Thok Gram features some eye-catching frame technologies.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thok</i></span></div>\n<p>Claimed to be the result of two years of R&amp;D on the trails of Finale Ligure in Liguria, Italy, the Thok Gram <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bike</a> has several flamboyant frame technologies.</p>\n<p>The frame itself looks rather sleek, with fully integrated cables that are routed through channels mounted into the frame’s carbon layup.</p>\n<p>It also has a paintjob courtesy of Aldo Drudi, who has provided custom-painted helmets for the likes of Valentino Rossi and other big names in MotoGP.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The frame has ‘T-Ribs’ between the down tube and seat tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thok</i></span></div>\n<p>The linkage bearings in the frame are pressed directly into the carbon frame, without the use of aluminium inserts. Thok claims this has enabled it to increase rigidity in the suspension linkage, while minimising friction.</p>\n<p>Thok has used what it calls ‘T-Ribs’ on the frame, which are two small braces between the seat tube and the down tube, just above the bottom bracket area. These are said to improve lateral rigidity in the frame, as well as helping to dissipate pressure and make pedalling more effective, according to Thok.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/03/THOK-GRAM-RC-BLACK-13-5fad0ae.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"The bike uses a Shimano EP8 battery.\" title=\"THOK GRAM RC BLACK 13\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The bike uses a Shimano EP8 motor.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Thok</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/03/THOK-GRAM-RC-BLACK-11-26843f9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Thok Gram RC electric enduro chain protector.\" title=\"THOK GRAM RC BLACK 11\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The bike has an integrated chain protector.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Thok</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/03/THOK-GRAM-RC-BLACK-4-0296c9b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Thok Gram RC electric enduro rear shock.\" title=\"THOK GRAM RC BLACK 4\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The linkage bearings press into the frame. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Thok</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>There is also a T-Stopper, which is an integrated steering lock.
