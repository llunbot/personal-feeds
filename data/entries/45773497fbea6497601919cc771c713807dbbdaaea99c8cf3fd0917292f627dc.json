{"title":"Meet the AWS News Blog team!","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/meet-the-aws-news-blog-team/","date":1743555138000,"content":"<p>Now that <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/and-thats-a-wrap/\">Jeff Barr has retired from the AWS News Blog</a> as of December last year, the AWS News Blog team will keep sharing the most important and impactful AWS product launches the moment they become available. I want to quote Jeff’s last comment on the future of the News Blog again:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Going forward, the team will continue to grow and the goal remains the same: to provide our customers with carefully chosen, high-quality information about the latest and most meaningful AWS launches. The blog is in great hands and this team will continue to keep you informed even as the AWS pace of innovation continues to accelerate.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Since 2016, Jeff has been building the AWS News Blog as a team. Currently, we’re a group of 11 bloggers working in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. We co-work with AWS product teams, testing new features firsthand on behalf of customers, and delivering key details in the News Blog the way Jeff has always done.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/10/2025-aws-news-blog-team.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"454\" /></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-principles-aws-news-bloggers-jeff-barr/\">Leadership Principles for AWS News Bloggers</a> that Jeff shared on LinkedIn are a textbook for anyone writing for customers in tech companies. They’re the fundamentals that can help you understand and get started blogging quickly, and we’ll continue to stick to these principles with our team. This is why the AWS News Blog is different from other tech companies’ product news channels.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Voices from blog writers </u></strong><br /> You may be familiar with the names of News Blog writers, but you may not have had the chance to hear about them. Let us introduce ourselves!</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/channy-yun/\"><strong>Channy Yun (윤석찬)</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I’m honored to continue Jeff’s legacy as a new lead blogger of the News Blog team; he is my role model. When I joined AWS in 2014, the first thing I did was to create the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ko/blogs/korea\">AWS Korea Blog</a> and I started translating Jeff’s blog posts into the Korean language. During the journey, I learned how to write accurate, honest, and powerful guides to help customers get started with new AWS products and features.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/danilop/\"><strong>Danilo Poccia</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Since <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-dynamodb-transactions/\">my first News Blog post in 2018</a>, I have learned so much by being part of this team. Working with product managers and service teams is always an amazing experience. I am interested in serverless, event-driven architectures, and AI/ML. It’s incredible how technologies like generative AI are becoming part of software development implicitly (through AI-enabled development tools) and explicitly (by using models in code).</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/stormacq/\"><strong>Sébastien Stormacq</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I’m fortunate to have been a part of this team since 2019. When I don’t write posts, I produce episodes of the <a href=\"https://developers.podcast.go-aws.com/web/index.html\">AWS Developers Podcast</a> and <a href=\"https://francais.podcast.go-aws.com/web/index.html\">le podcast AWS en français</a>. I also work with the teams for <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-mac-instances.html?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">Amazon EC2 Mac</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-swift/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">AWS SDK for Swift</a>, and the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/add-macos-to-your-continuous-integration-pipelines-with-aws-codebuild/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">CodeBuild</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-add-your-swift-packages-to-aws-codeartifact/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">CodeArtifact</a> teams trying to make the AWS Cloud easier to use for Apple developers. My pet project is the <a href=\"https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime\">Swift Runtime for AWS Lambda</a>.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/vby/\"><strong>Veliswa Boya</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles\">Amazon Leadership Principles</a> (LPs) guide all that we do here at AWS, including the work we do as authors of the News Blog. As a developer advocate, I’ve taken the guidance of the LPs and used it to guide members of the AWS community who are looking to create technical content, especially those new in their technical content creation journey.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/donnie/\"><strong>Donnie Prakoso</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Just like brewing coffee, being a blog author has been a mix of fun, challenge, and reward. I’ve been particularly fortunate to observe how customer obsession is built into AWS teams. I’ve seen how they work backwards, transforming your feedback into services or features. I genuinely hope that you enjoy reading our articles and look forward to the next chapter of the News Blog team.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/kayabali\"><strong>Esra Kayabali</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>As an author, I’m committed to delivering timely information about the latest AWS innovations and launches to our global audience of builders, developers, and technology enthusiasts. I understand the importance of providing clear, accurate, and actionable content that helps you use AWS services effectively. Happy reading everyone!</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/guimathe\"><strong>Matheus Guimaraes</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>My specialties are .NET development and microservices, but I’ve always been a jack-of-all-trades and writing for this blog helps me to keep my knife sharp across all corners of modern technology, while also helping others do the same. Thousands of people read the AWS News Blog and use it as a go-to source to keep up with what’s new and to help them make decisions, so I know that what we are doing is meaningful work with huge impact.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/kosanamr/\"><strong>Prasad Rao</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Through my blogs, I strive to highlight not just the “what” of new services, but also the “why” and “how” they can transform businesses and user experiences. As a solutions architect specializing in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/windows/\">Microsoft Workloads on AWS</a>, I help customers migrate and modernize their workloads and build scalable architecture on AWS. I also mentor diverse people to excel in their cloud careers.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/eliaws/\"><strong>Elizabeth Fuentes</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Every time I start writing a new blog, I feel honored to be part of this team, to be able to experiment with something new before it’s released, and to be able to share my experience with the reader. This team is made up of specialists of all levels and from multiple countries and together, we are a multicultural and multi-specialty team. Thank you, reader, for being here.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/betzheng/\"><strong>Betty Zheng (郑予彬)</strong></a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Joining the News Blog team has transformed how I communicate about technology. With an ever-curious mindset, I approach each new announcement aiming to make innovative services accessible and engaging. By bringing my unique and diverse perspective to technical content, I strive to help developers truly enjoy exploring our latest technologies.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Micah Walter</strong></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>As a senior solutions architect, I support enterprise customers in the New York City region and beyond. I advise executives, engineers, and architects at every step along their journey to the cloud, with a deep focus on sustainability and practical design.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I also want to give credit to our behind-the-scenes editor-in-chief, <strong>Jane Watson,</strong> and program manager, <strong>Jane Scolieri</strong>, who play an essential role in helping us get product launch news to you as soon as it happens, including the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/top-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2024/\">60 launches we announced in one week at re:Invent 2024</a>!</p> \n<p><strong><u>Share your feedback</u></strong><br /> At AWS, we are customer obsessed.
