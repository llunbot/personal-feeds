One takeaway, the analysts said, is that they have “confirmed” that the 4th-gen iPhone SE is currently scheduled for launch towards the end of the first quarter of next year. That almost certainly means March, which incidentally is when the 3rd-gen SE arrived back in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three SE models released so far, indeed, have come out in the spring: March 2016 for the 1st-gen SE March 2022 for the 3rd-gen model, and April 2020 for the 2nd-gen SE. A three-year wait between models is unusual but not unprecedented, as there was a <em>four</em>-year wait between the first and second iPhone SE releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the launch timeframe, the note reiterated the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478796/leak-claims-the-iphone-se-4-will-have-an-apple-made-5g-modem.html\">current theory</a> that the 4th-gen SE will be the first iPhone to feature an Apple-made 5G modem. This is obviously a key step forward for Apple, as it holds the potential for substantial cost savings; but it could also mean dramatically increased battery efficiency for customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem surprising that Apple would bestow such a potentially beneficial feature on the budget-focused SE a good six months before it lands on the flagship iPhones, but it does now look like it’s going to happen. The inclusion of the new modem, plus the 48MP main camera from the iPhone 15, 8GB of RAM, the A18 processor, and Apple Intelligence support mean this is shaping up to be an iPhone SE <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2472644/apple-is-finally-making-an-iphone-se-thats-actually-special.html\">that’s actually special</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news and rumors, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">new iPhone SE</a> superguide.
