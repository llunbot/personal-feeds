This is a part of the world where the average pensioner sipping an espresso outside a cafe is likely to be better dressed than you. Why? Because in northern Italy people understand the importance of a good fit. You don’t have to buy a suit off the peg here; you can have it made to measure by your neighbourhood tailor. It’s custom, and it always yields the best results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local framebuilder Alessandro Graser applies the same philosophy to his bikes. These aren’t cookie-cutter frames badged up and held in stock until someone clicks ‘buy now’. Every tube is made to measure, with an open dialogue between buyer and builder throughout the process.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/richard-lambert-windover\">Meet the maker: Richard Lambert of Windover</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mon-cycles\">Meet the maker: Owen Sherlock of Môn Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 143: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘We even have our own carbon fibre moulds so the frame geometry can be tailored to a customer’s exact measurements,’ Graser tells <em>Cyclist</em>. ‘It means every bike is unique. Once the customer has it, they will probably be the only person with that bike. It offers a sense of exclusivity.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graser’s brand, Cybro, was born in 2019. It produces everything from a single-speed city bike to the range-topping N°07 e-MTB. There are currently seven models in Cybro’s lineup, six of them built around belt-drive Pinion gearboxes, which require less maintenance and can generally run for longer than a traditional chain-and-derailleur system before parts need to be replaced.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"683\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02-683x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Alessandro Graser Cybro\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02-683x970.jpg 683w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02-211x300.jpg 211w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02-768x1091.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02-1081x1536.jpg 1081w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02-750x1066.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02-1140x1620.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Building bicycles is in the blood for Alessandro Graser, whose grandfather did just that in Argentina during the Second World War.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The story really started with my grandfather,’ says Graser. ‘He was involved with the production of bicycles in Argentina during the Second World War. As a kid, there were always bicycles in my house, so of course I started to play with them, ride them and later work with them myself.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A portmanteau of ‘cycle’ and ‘bros’ (as in brothers, not the 1980s pop stars), Cybro is the natural evolution of Graser’s work in bike refurbishing, restoration and customisation. With the help of one other artisan, he creates Cybro’s bikes in the small Bassano del Grappa workshop where the brand was conceived.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Prototype</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The bicycle pictured is not one of the seven core models you’ll find listed on the Cybro website. This is something different and experimental. Featuring a raw carbon finish, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/exclusive-in-depth-review-sram-red-etap-axs-hydraulic-road-disc\" target=\"_blank\">Sram Red eTap AXS</a> groupset, custom-machined aluminium lugs and aggressive, racy geometry, the Prototype is a lightweight road machine that was created based on feedback and reviews from clients.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Alessandro Graser Cybro\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I chose to build this bike with the materials and parts that we found were best,’ Graser says. ‘Like a carbon frame and also the aluminium lugs, for example. It’s a modern expression of a classic 1990s frame, built up using modern components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The frame is the same as you’ll find on our N°02 City Bike [a sporty-looking single-speed], made using our own moulds to create the tubes. From there, we conduct a series of tests that we’ve developed to assess the flexibility and strength of each tube, and once those have been passed we build the frame using the customer’s measurements.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>One of the things that makes this bike so unique is the use of eye-catching aluminium lugs to reinforce the junctions between tubes. They’re custom made depending on tube measurements and geometry, and are crafted using a 5-axis CNC machine. They can be produced in all colours of the rainbow on request too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We can do a silver one, a black one, we can even do a gold-plated one. This is around €2,000 just for the gold, which is very expensive, but the contrast between the carbon and gold is very impressive when you see it.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Alessandro Graser Cybro\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-142-cybro-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The lugs are made from high-end aluminium, which makes them incredibly strong and durable, but they’re very labour-intensive and time-consuming to make. From designing to setting up the machine and actually making them, the whole process can take two days just for a set of lugs.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seatmast topper is machined in the same manner as the lugs, and allows for 35mm of height adjustment. Not that you’ll need it if you’ve had the entire bike tailored to your measurements. ‘We’ll only make a few of these,’ says Graser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Like, maximum 15 pieces. Whoever buys it will be one of the only people out there with this bike. Usually, this kind of bike is only sold to people who are already customers. They might have already bought the N°07, for example, which is the e-mountain bike. So that makes it obviously more exclusive for the customer and gives them the sense of having something that nobody else does. That’s ultimately what we want to deliver.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 142 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alessandro-graser-cybro\">Meet the maker: Alessandro Graser of Cybro</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6752046a4bbb127da90592c62b528d45e0471a8603f8070230262f246f671e6e","category":"Cycling"}
