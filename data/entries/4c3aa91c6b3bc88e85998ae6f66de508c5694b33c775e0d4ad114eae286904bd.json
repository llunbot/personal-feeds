The ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro models will have larger display sizes than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models and the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/URedditor\">researcher Unknownz21</a>, the ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro (D93 in Apple's internal documentation) will feature a display with a size of 6.3 inches, while the ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro Max (D94) will feature a display size of 6.9 inches. Note that these are the full dimensions of the display, and the actual viewable area will be slightly smaller due to the rounded corners of the design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‚ÄåiPhone 14 Pro‚Äå and ‚ÄåiPhone 14 Pro‚Äå Max displays measure in at 6.1 and 6.7 inches, respectively, so increases to 6.3 and 6.9 will be noticeable. A screen size increase of 0.2 inches perhaps suggests a new design, plus Apple could potentially also slim down the bezels even further than it plans to with the ‚ÄåiPhone 15 Pro‚Äå models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple is working on two Pro models<br />for the iPhone 16 series, with increased display panel sizes (the actual display area is a bit smaller):<br /><br />D93 - 6.3‚Äù<br /><br />D94 - 6.9‚Äù<br /><br />Both models are set to feature the new periscope lens, unlike the 15 lineup where it‚Äôs restricted to the Pro Max.</p>‚Äî Unknownz21 üåà (@URedditor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1658497936416817152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nIncreased screen sizes are expected to be limited to the ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro and ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro Max, with the standard ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå to continue to feature a screen size of 6.1 inches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnalyst Ross Young was the first to suggest that the ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro models would have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">larger display sizes</a>. Last week, Young also said that Apple will introduce displays that are 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, though he said these numbers are rounded to the nearest decimal place from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1655767475689263105\">6.2x and 6.8x inches</a>. Young plans to provide more specific information later in the month, and the sizing discrepancy between what he's shared so far and Unknownz21's sizing detail is likely due to the difference between actual display area and viewable display area.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnknownz21 confirms that ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro and ‚ÄåiPhone 16‚Äå Pro Max will both get periscope zoom camera technology, a feature that will be limited to the ‚ÄåiPhone 15 Pro‚Äå Max this year. Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-pro-models-larger-periscope/\">has also said</a> that the updated camera functionality will be coming to both Pro models in 2024. The periscope lens will allow for 5x to 6x optical zoom, a notable improvement over the current 3x maximum zoom offered by the ‚ÄåiPhone 14 Pro‚Äå Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> has worked with Unknownz21 on past leaks and we have seen documentation that suggests the information he is sharing is legitimate and reliable.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/unknownz21/\">Unknownz21</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/\">iPhone 16 Pro Models to Have Larger 6.3-Inch and 6.9-Inch Display Sizes, Periscope Zoom Lenses</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-models-to-have-larger-6-3-inch-and-6-9-inch-display-sizes-periscope-zoom-lenses.2389685/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4c3aa91c6b3bc88e85998ae6f66de508c5694b33c775e0d4ad114eae286904bd","category":"Apple"}
