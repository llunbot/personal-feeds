A 700x35mm width will follow.</p>\n<p>The black-wall tyre will cost £67.99/€74.90. The Classic (or tan) wall version will cost £69.99/€74.90. US pricing is to be confirmed.</p>\n<h2>Bead-to-bead protection</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pirelli Cinturato RCX gravel tyre.\" title=\"DSC06610\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cinturato RCX gravel tyre features Pirelli’s TechWALL X structure.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pirelli</i></span></div>\n<p>Pirelli says the Cinturato Gravel RCX is designed for “extreme competitions”. This comes down to the reinforcement the brand has built into the tyre.</p>\n<p>The tyre features a new TechWALL X structure, with a 60 TPI nylon casing that has a longer overlap on the sidewall.</p>\n<p>There is also a bead-to-bead protective layer of high-density fabric. This appears on all of Pirelli’s gravel tyres, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>Pirelli says this combination of features makes the Cinturato Gravel RCX “more resistant to cuts on the sidewalls”.</p>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/eurobike-show/\">Eurobike</a>, a Pirelli representative <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/eurobike-2023-gallery/\">explained</a> the decision to build a tyre with more protection was made in order to meet the demands of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/gravel-racing/\">gravel racing</a> in America specifically.</p>\n<p>The representative said gravel racing in America often happens on trails with loose flintstone. These sharp stones can easily puncture sidewalls. Greater puncture protection should serve riders well when competing at gravel races such as Unbound.</p>\n<h2>Optimised for wide rims and low pressures</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pirelli Cinturato RCX gravel tyre.\" title=\"DSC06608\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pirelli says the Cinturato RCX is optimised for greater rim widths and lower pressures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pirelli</i></span></div>\n<p>Pirelli says the Cinturato Gravel RCX has a tubeless-ready aramid folding bead, optimised for greater <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">rim widths</a> and lower <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/gravel-tyre-pressure/\">gravel bike tyre pressures</a>.</p>\n<p>Although Pirelli hasn’t provided recommended tyre pressures for the tyre, its mounting and sizing guide is based on inflating the 700x40mm tyre to 65psi and the 300x35mm tyre to 73psi.</p>\n<h2>Shared tread design</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pirelli Cinturato RCX gravel tyre.\" title=\"DSC06559\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tread is the same as on Pirelli’s other gravel tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pirelli</i></span></div>\n<p>The Cinturato Gravel RCX shares its tread pattern with some of Pirelli’s other gravel tyres, including the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pirelli-cinturato-gravel-rc-tyre/\">Gravel RC</a>.</p>\n<p>Pirelli says the tread helps make the new tyre fast on hard surfaces and straight sections thanks to its low and tightly-packed central knobs.</p>\n<p>The tyre has high knobs on its edges for grip and to support handling when turning.</p>\n<p>Pirelli says this tread pattern is based on that of its Scorpion XC RC <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">cross-country mountain bike tyre</a>.</p>\n<p>The tyre uses Pirelli’s SpeedGrip compound. This is said to offer high grip in wet conditions and decrease rolling resistance, thanks to its “more efficient energy management” – although Pirelli hasn’t specified which compound SpeedGrip betters.</p>\n<h2>Cinturato Gravel RCX claimed weights</h2>\n<p>Pirelli says the black and Classic Cinturato Gravel RCX tyres in the wider 700x40mm size will weigh a claimed 560g.</p>\n<p>The Cinturato Gravel RCX Classic in 700x35mm weighs a claimed 480g.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0016d4934e1f103431a54a070decbc957c844b0000d3fb023277d8a0b76ddb00","category":"Cycling"}
