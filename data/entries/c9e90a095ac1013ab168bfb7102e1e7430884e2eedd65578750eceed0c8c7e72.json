There’s an iPad at a price to suit most budgets, but what if you want a more powerful iPad for less money? Thanks to the refurbished iPad market you can find a powerful iPad without having to spend a fortune. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of places offering to sell you a refurbished iPad, including <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Refurbished and Clearance store,</a> which is a section on Apple’s website where you can buy refurbished iPads (you can also buy Macs and MacBooks, iPhones, Apple Watch, HomePod and Apple TV.) Apple’s not the only company selling refurbished iPads though, and you may be able to save more if you shop elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all refurbished iPads are as good as the ones Apple sells though, so you should beware of the pitfalls. We will run through the things to avoid in this article, so you can be confident you will get the best refurbished iPad for your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll explain what the Apple Refurbished Store is and what Apple Certified Refurbished means. We’ll list the best places to buy a refurbished or used iPad, and we will share the price you can expect to pay for a refurbished iPad, iPad Air, iPad mini or iPad Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why buy a refurbished iPad? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Refurbished offers you more peace of mind than buying a second-hand or used iPad because, to describe a product as “refurbished”, the company selling it should have rigorously tested and repaired it in order to get it to work just like new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, buying an iPad that is pre-owned but <em>not refurbished</em>–from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=pre+owned+ipads&amp;xcust=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">eBay</a> or <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.gumtree.com/search?search_category=tablets-ebooks-ereaders&amp;q=ipad&amp;xcust=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">GumTree</a>, for example–means you’re buying the device “as is,” with no post-purchase protection, which makes it slightly riskier if you don’t know the seller. If the previous owner has forgotten to dissociate their Apple ID from the iPad, you may potentially be locked out from the device. Apple’s customer service won’t be able to help you unlock it without the original Apple ID details because of their strict security policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the device is factory refurbished or certified refurbished, you can be confident the quality and reliability will match a new device–yet you will make a decent saving. The company selling it may also offer you some sort of warranty with the device so that if anything goes wrong they will address it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all ‘refurbished’ iPads are equal though. So you should establish what checks have been performed by the company before you buy from them. The safest place to buy a refurbished iPad is from <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Refurbished Store</a> where all products sold will have undergone rigorous testing to be Apple Certified refurbished (which we will discuss in the next section). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we explain what Apple does before it can sell an iPad in the refurbished store, you are probably wondering where these iPads have come from. You might be concerned that they have been returned to Apple because they are faulty, for example. While it’s possible that a customer returned the iPad due to a fault, that fault would have been rectified by Apple before the iPad could be resold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These refurbished iPads could also be ex-demonstration models used during Apple teaching programs, or it could be a unit sold to a customer who decided to return it under the standard sale-and-returns procedure. (Apple allows any customer to return a Mac bought from the Apple Store within 14 days for a refund – see <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Standard Returns Policy U.S</a>. and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://store.apple.com/uk/help/returns_refund&amp;xcust=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Returns Policy U.K</a>.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not even the case that you can only buy old iPads Apple’s refurbished store–you will find models from previous years as well as current models. The same is true of other refurbished resellers, although some offer much older iPad than Apple does (which can be problematic if they aren’t supported by software–we’ll elaborate further below). </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple iPad Pro 11-inch M2 2022\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_10.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Apple Certified refurbished?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple states that: “Every Apple Certified Refurbished product completes a rigorous refurbishment process that includes full testing that meets the same functional standards as new Apple products. Your refurbished device is truly ‘like new'”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore it shouldn’t concern you that a customer may have returned the iPad due to a fault, because that fault would have been rectified by Apple before the iPad could be resold (and if the fault couldn’t be rectified it would be scrapped). Parts that don’t work or are damaged will be replaced so that the final product works just like new. For even more peace of mind, every refurbished iPad sold by Apple comes with a one-year warranty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d prefer to have a longer warranty than the one-year version that’s included, you can buy <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/support/products/ipad/&amp;xcust=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AppleCare+</a> for your refurbished iPad. AppleCare+ extends your warranty to two years and allows additional technical support, 24/7 access to Apple experts, and hardware coverage for up to two accidental damage incidents. Each damage claim will cost an additional $49/£39, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each ‘certified refurbished’ iPad:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Will be thoroughly cleaned and inspected</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Includes Apple’s standard one-year limited warranty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And up to 90 days of complimentary technical support</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comes with all accessories, cables, and operating systems</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is packaged in a brand-new white box</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is dispatched with free shipping and returns</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can be purchased via financing options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And can be delivered next day</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That is Apple’s procedure, other shops that sell refurbished iPads may follow a similar series of checks–or at least they should if they are to claim that the iPad is certified refurbished. Other stores will label the refurbished products according to their quality, with bigger savings to be had on the less good examples. We’ll list the best options below, including whether or not a warranty is included. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple iPad Pro 11-inch M2 2022\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_20.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much can you save in the Apple Refurbished Store </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Apple refurbished store</a> has a selection that includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Standard iPad (8th and 9th generation), save from $50 – $70</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (4th generation), save from $50 – $120</li>\n\n\n\n<li>11-inch iPad Pro (2nd and 3rd generation), save from $110 – $310</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12.9-inch iPad Pro (4th and 5th generation), save from $160 – $320</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (5th and 6th generation), save from $60 – $120</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K. you’ll find a similar selection of iPads available from <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/ipad\">Apple’s U.K. refurbished store</a>. You’ll find the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Standard iPad (9th generation), save from £50 – £80</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (4th generation), save from £80 – £120</li>\n\n\n\n<li>11-inch iPad Pro (2nd and 3rd generation), save from £110 – £260</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th generation), save from £110 – £320</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (5th and 6th generation), save from £170 – £480</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for and what to avoid </h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Refurbish quality can vary from retailer to retailer. First off, look at the refurbished grade. Often you’ll see this noted as Grade A, Grade B, or Grade C. Or similarly, Pristine, Excellent, Good and Fair. As you’ve guessed, this correlates with the condition of the device. It’s not an exact science, as each retailer will have its own standards for each grade, but it generally indicates what to expect (especially if you’re buying online). Grade A refurbished devices should look just like new or have very, <em>very </em>faint signs of use. Meanwhile, Grade B devices may have minor scratches or wear, while Grade C devices will show obvious signs of wear. OfFten these ‘Fair’ graded devices will lack the full year warranty. You get what you pay for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Warranty</strong>: Second, ensure the refurbished iPad comes with a warranty. This shouldn’t be too difficult as most resellers will offer coverage for at least one year. A warranty allows you to get repairs and other technical help should the device have any issues. Just beware that it might be difficult to get additional tech support after the warranty expires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Age</strong>: Don’t buy an iPad that is more than a few years old. Apple updates the iPad operating system every year, and each time it does a few iPad’s fall off the supported list.  For example when iPad OS 16 launched in 2022 iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 were not compatible, and, when iPadOS 17 arrives in late 2023 the following iPads will not support it: 2016 iPad Pro 9.7-inch, A9X chip, 2015 iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation), A9X chip, 2017 iPad (5th generation) A9 processor. This doesn’t mean that Apple won’t issue software updates when security flaws become known, it will do that for a few more years, but it does mean that those older devices will not be as safe to use in a few years time as they are right now. It’s not just software support that you lose over time, Apple first moves a product into the vintage list, and then to the obsolete list, once the product is in that list you won’t be able to get rel=palcement parts should something go wrong, so be sure to check <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/HT201624&amp;xcust=1-1-670633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s list of vintage and obsolete products</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storage</strong>: Older iPads generally have less storage, which is likely to be insufficient for your more modern needs. We suggest you steer clear of any iPad with less than 64GB storage as this simply won’t be enough, unfortunately, many refurbished iPads have a paltry 32GB or even 16GB storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Resale</strong>: Resale value of a refurbished device won’t be very high if you want to sell the iPad later. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple iPad Pro 11-inch M2 2022\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPac-Pro-11_inch-M2-2022_review_3.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best places to buy refurbished iPads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Apple Refurbished Store is an excellent place to buy a reconditioned iPad, you may find stock is limited; and in some cases, other retailers offer newer models second-hand or refurbished at better prices too.
