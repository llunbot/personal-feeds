Everyone in the tech world has been freaking out about this new pocket protector thing that wants to \"replace your smartphone.\" It's called the \"<a href=\"https://hu.ma.ne/\">Humane AI Pin</a>.\" As far as we can tell, it's a $700 screenless voice assistant box and, like all smartphone-ish devices released in the last 10 years, it has some AI in it. It's as if Google Glass had a baby with a pager from the 1990s.</p>\n<p>It's a voice assistant box, so that means it has a microphone and speaker. There's no hot word, and it's not always listening, so you'll be pressing a button to speak to it, and you'll get a response back. There's also a camera, and because you're expected to mount this on your clothing at chest level via a magnetic back piece, you'll be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/02/what-google-glass-needs-to-maybe-succeed-in-society/\">creepily pointing a camera</a> at everyone the whole time you're using it. It claims to be \"screenless,\" but it has a pretty cool 720p laser projection system that seems to function as a fine monochrome screen that projects a smartwatch-like UI onto your hand. It shows some super basic UI elements, like a circular media player or a scrolling wall of text. A few hand gestures, like tapping your fingers together, will let you interact with it.</p>\n<p>Despite claiming to be able to replace a smartphone, the Humane AI Pin is going back to the Dark Ages and not supporting <em>any</em> apps. We've seen so many devices live and die by their app ecosystems, and the matter-of-fact quote from the presentation was, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HVejEB5uVk\">We don't do apps</a>.\" You'll be locked into whatever features and services Humane has built into the <a href=\"https://hu.ma.ne/jobs/4090047004\">Android-based</a> \"Cosmos\" OS. So if you want to play music, it needs to be from Tidal, a service with<a href=\"https://medium.com/@cmiller002/analysis-of-streaming-platform-tidal-5c79b318567e\"> 0â€“2 percent market share</a>, because that's who the Humane people have partnered with. It's unclear if there is any other third-party functionality other than that. Humane's <a href=\"https://hu.ma.ne/aipin/cosmos\">\"Cosmos\" page</a> shows logos for Slack and then logos from Microsoft and Google, which could mean anything.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982491#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982491&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be823eacaa668df67d95c9ff3868982ad31baa19509395805e0d80488a849cd9","category":"Tech"}
