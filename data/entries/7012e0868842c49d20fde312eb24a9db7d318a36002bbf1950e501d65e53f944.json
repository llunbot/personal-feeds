And Garmin<sup>®</sup> is just one of the mega-brands available…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Give yourself the Edge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently in stock at Tredz is the class-leading Garmin Edge<sup>®</sup> 1050. A premium GPS cycling computer, it’s a shining light in the world of not only navigation but also connectivity. Owners rave about its super-bright colour touchscreen interface, and the fact that it offers up to 20 hours of battery life in the most demanding use cases (and if you’re riding for more than 20 hours in a single hit, hats off to you!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mapping on offer is unparalleled in the world of GPS bike computers, and the way it hooks up with your smartphone really makes it stand out from the crowd. You can get mirrored text messages and alerts, leaderboards, configure your electronic shifters through the Garmin head unit (as well as view their battery life and swipe through data pages), and it’s compatible with any ANT+ enabled e-bike. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-970x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tredz-garmin-1050-2.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Other hardware highlights include the ability to receive road hazard alerts reported by fellow cyclists, and contribute your own route when using the Edge 1050 with a compatible smartphone. The presence of a built-in speaker, meanwhile, means you can hear workout and navigation prompts, and even alert other riders and pedestrians with a loud on-device bike bell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The icing on the cake (almost literally) is that, beyond being able to download custom data fields, widgets and apps via the Garmin Connect IQ<sup>TM</sup> Store, you can even use the Edge 1050 to settle up for your café stop coffee and pastries, with Garmin Pay contactless payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Train with Tredz</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Garmin Edge 1050 really shines is in its ability to assist your training, no matter what the end goal. If you’re focussing on a race or event, the Edge 1050 works seamlessly with Garmin’s free training plans, while event-adaptive training delivers personalised workouts that – as the name suggests – adapt to your performance and recovery when used in tandem with a power meter and heart rate monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real-time stamina insights let you know how much you’ve got left in the tank, the Climbpro Ascent Planner shows you the remaining length and grade of ascent on a hill, the head unit will tell you how your body is holding up with heat and altitude acclimation (for this you will need a training status and your VO<sup>2</sup> Max, which requires a power meter and heart rate monitor), and it can even tell prompt you with hydration and nutrition alerts to ensure you’re properly fuelled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training with power? You can manage your efforts with recommended power targets. It even reports real-time stamina and wind conditions to help adjust your targets as you ride. For these reasons and more, it’s an indispensable piece of kit, and just one of the compelling causes to visit Tredz.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Going beyond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good people at Tredz make it even easier to bag the kit you really want. Besides benefitting from their years of experience and knowledge, you can get 0% APR finance on any products over £99, and all orders with a value of more than £30 are delivered free of charge in the UK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to this their willingness to price-match any item you find cheaper at a UK retailer, Cytech-qualified builds and 16-point quality checks on all bikes (which are delivered fully built), live online chat seven days a week, and a very generous 365-day returns policy, and it’s difficult to imagine a better place to shop online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Garmin-Edge-1050-Cycle-Computer_270027.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Shop the Garmin Edge 1050 at Tredz now</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/tredz-garmin-1050\">Follow the leader with Tredz</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7012e0868842c49d20fde312eb24a9db7d318a36002bbf1950e501d65e53f944","category":"Cycling"}
