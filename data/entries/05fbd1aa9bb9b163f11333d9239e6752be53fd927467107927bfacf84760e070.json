New Macs are coming soon, as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reminds us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his latest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-15/apple-s-hearing-aid-sleep-apnea-saved-iphone-16-event-m4-mac-launch-details-m13kkabb?cmpid=BBD091524_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240915&amp;utm_campaign=poweron\">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman reaffirmed that Apple will release Macs with the M4 chip “in the coming weeks.” As he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/apple-aapl-readies-m4-chip-mac-line-including-new-macbook-air-and-mac-pro\">reported</a> back in April, Apple will update the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini. This new report doesn’t really add anything new, but Gurman notes that some Macs are ready to ship now, while the high-end MacBook Pro and Mac mini are still in production. As ususal, Apple wants to wait until all models are ready to release before holding its event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Macs will feature the M4 chip, which was introduced with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">iPad Pro</a> last May, though it’s yet to be seen what kind of specifications the Mac M4 will have. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2422215/the-mac-mini-is-getting-even-smaller-with-first-redesign-in-15-years.html\">M4 Mac mini is expected to  undergo a redesign</a> that makes it about the size of the Apple TV. The MacBook Pro and iMac will have the same design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will likely place in late October. Last year’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2119519/apple-scary-fast-event-live-updates-mac-macbook-magic-mouse.html\">Scary Fast event</a> was held on October 30 when Apple launched the M3 family of chips alongside a refreshed iMac and MacBook Pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also restated that Apple plans to ship the M4 MacBook Air in the “first quarter of 2025” and the M4 Mac Studio in the middle of next year, which likely means a WWDC 2025 announcement. Gurman also reported that the M4 Mac Pro “will launch before the end of 2025.” <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2426453/m4-processor-mac-mini-studio-pro-imac-macbook-air.html\">Get the details on Apple’s M4 Mac release schedule</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"05fbd1aa9bb9b163f11333d9239e6752be53fd927467107927bfacf84760e070","category":"Apple"}
