Apple also deactivated 282 million fraudulent customer accounts and blocked another 198 million before they were created.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFewer fraudulent developer accounts were terminated in 2022 than 2021 because of \"new methods and protocols\" that Apple implemented to make fraudulent account creation more difficult. Apple claims that it protected users from \"nearly 57,000\" apps sourced from \"illegitimate storefronts\" that distribute harmful software. Over 147 million fraudulent ratings and reviews were blocked from the ‌App Store‌, preventing customers from being tricked by reviews left by bot accounts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's ‌App Store‌ security figures come as it is facing pressure to allow <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> customers to install apps outside of the ‌App Store‌ through \"sideloading\" or alternate app marketplaces. The European Union has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/01/dma-eu-law-could-force-major-changes-apple/\">already passed legislation</a> forcing Apple to allow apps to be installed outside of the ‌App Store‌, functionality that the company is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/\">expected to implement</a> in Europe as soon as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe United States is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/26/apple-statement-revised-sideloading-bill/\">working on similar legislation</a> to allow customers to bypass the ‌App Store‌, and Apple says such mandates would \"undermine the privacy and security protections\" that ‌iPhone‌ users have come to rely on and would allow \"malware, scams, and data-exploitation to proliferate.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/apple-app-store-security-features/\">Apple Claims App Store Security Features Prevented Over $2 Billion in Fraudulent Transactions in 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-claims-app-store-security-features-prevented-over-2-billion-in-fraudulent-transactions-in-2022.2389711/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d42b56bee6fcf8843cc49bba550493e8153cbe451c51eb0cbb0cfbd1d24bd69f","category":"Apple"}
