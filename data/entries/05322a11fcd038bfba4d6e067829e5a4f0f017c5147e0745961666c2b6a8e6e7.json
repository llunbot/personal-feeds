In partnering with Esker, I’ve launched into a world unknown to me. Through all of our conversations, one thing has been made glaringly apparent; the team at Esker truly sees my worth. Not in a one-dimensional way, but in a complex way that makes me feel respected, valued, and curious. I feel seen. </em></p>\n<p><em>As we partner to bring increased representation of the diversity across cycling, I get to spend more time and share my access to resources with a community I care deeply about— Indian Country. In signing with Esker, I’ve negotiated access to our bike fleet with hopes of hosting more events across Indian Country to give my relatives the experience of riding highly capable bikes. </em></p>\n<p><em>As I have been racing competitively as a singlespeed mountain biker, I’ve been increasingly curious as to what possibilities exist if I ride a full-suspension bike or maybe even a bike with gears. I am curious as to what bikepacking looks like if we can extend more invitations to riders of diverse socioeconomic brackets in an ethical way. I am humbled to join this team, this family, working to fight for our place in the bike world. Look out, we got big ideas and the heart to make things happen.”  – Alexandera Houchin </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can find more about Alexandera on her <a href=\"https://kruegeroutdoor.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54ff81e6600222d8263a1a1dc&amp;id=31817f0071&amp;e=41d9857d47\" target=\"_blank\">Substack</a> and <a href=\"https://kruegeroutdoor.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=54ff81e6600222d8263a1a1dc&amp;id=870eba2e40&amp;e=41d9857d47\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/alexandera-houchin-is-riding-for-esker-cycles/\">Alexandera Houchin is Riding for Esker Cycles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"05322a11fcd038bfba4d6e067829e5a4f0f017c5147e0745961666c2b6a8e6e7","category":"Cycling"}
