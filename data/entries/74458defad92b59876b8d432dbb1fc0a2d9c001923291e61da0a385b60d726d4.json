Some Apple watchers remain skeptical that the notoriously stubborn company will actually cave to political pressure and give up a chunk of its accessories revenue, but the writing appears to be on the wall with the latest report from the supply chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1651502314237345792&amp;xcust=1-1-1803061-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">ShrimpApplePro</a> claimed on Twitter that MFi (or Made For iPhone) USB-C EarPods and cables are already in mass production and have been for a while‚Äìsomething the prolific leaker cites as ‚Äúthe best proof that it‚Äôs happening.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Also USB-C MFI cables and Earpods are in mass production for a while is the best proof that it‚Äôs happening.</p>‚Äî ShrimpApplePro üç§ (@VNchocoTaco) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1651502314237345792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1803061-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 27, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple‚Äôs iconic white EarPods are less culturally significant than they once were, thanks to the growing appeal of the wireless AirPods, the demise of the iPhone‚Äôs headphone jack (hence the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-1803061-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector\" target=\"_blank\">Lightning port</a>), and the removal of bundled headphones from slimmed-down iPhone packaging.
