The Italian saddle maestros just unveiled the Prologo Dimension 18K, the world’s first saddle featuring rails crafted entirely from <strong>18 karat gold</strong>. That’s right — your bike can now be just as bougie as your <a href=\"https://victoriaarduino.com/en/venus-bar-eng/#top\" target=\"_blank\">espresso machine. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prologo Dimension 18K gold-railed saddle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1875\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K.webp\" alt=\"Prologo-Dimension-18K saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, the Dimension 18K shares the same DNA as Prologo’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prologo-dimension-r2-shaves-15-weight-off-already-light-short-v-shaped-saddle/\" target=\"_blank\">standard Dimension R2</a>, a multi-discipline saddle designed for comfort and performance, which you could already buy for a measly sum of 250€. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-05-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-05-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Dimension 18K rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-05-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-05-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-05-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-05-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-05-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-04-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-04-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Dimension 18K - front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-04-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-04-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-04-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-04-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-04-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But this one?</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s got gold rails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Because Prologo wanted to push the boundaries of art, technology, and, presumably, your bank account. The brand promises “luxurious performance” and an “exclusive” ride feel — though whether gold provides any tangible performance benefit is up for debate (unless it somehow intimidates your riding buddies into letting you win every town line sprint). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s not even talk about structural characteristics…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How to Get One</strong>?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Dimension 18K\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Prologo-Dimension-18K-02-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, this masterpiece of cycling excess will be a limited-edition release, available exclusively on Tuesday, April 1, 2025 (yes, you read that right). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It won’t be found at your local bike shop — only at Prologo’s finest jewelry retailers. Pricing will depend on daily gold market rates, meaning your saddle’s value might fluctuate more than your FTP during winter training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it absurd? Absolutely.  Do we want one anyway? Also, yes, oh — and pesci d’aprile!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://prologo.it/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Prologo.it</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prologo-worlds-first-18k-gold-saddle/\">Prologo Drops the World’s First 18K Gold Saddle — Because Why Not?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f6d9657cf60da34fc1e0e882e86a8d4a5e4c180585768f732427873f4bf38020","category":"Cycling"}
