They were perfect commuters, ‘cross racers, and when set up fixed, perfect for commuting on snowy winter roads.

I’ve had this bike on/off for a bit now and it honestly might be my favorite to come into my possession. It’s primarily lived its life in this configuration, having been put together as just an around town parts bin bike with the key component being the rear wheel with a Level hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_20211130_102737521_HDR-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_20211130_102841581_HDR-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The bike itself has been nothing short of awesome, seeing use on everything from commuting, snowy winter road rides (shout out Sheldon B) delivering coffee during the onset of Covid, acting as an MTB (it has flat bars), and most recently it was the bike I rode for the NNeV 60 mile and that’s honestly what really made me finally realize that when all the others have let me down, this is the bike that will be there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_20211130_102850017_HDR-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_20211130_102719295_HDR-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_20211130_102856601_HDR-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I really couldn’t be happier with this thing as it never failed to put a smile on my face.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_20211130_102709270_HDR-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Frame- All City Nature Boy Canti<br />\nFork- Bontrager Race Lite Carbon<br />\nStem- 130mm<br />\nBars- Hybrid Take Off’s<br />\nHeadset- Chris King<br />\nGrips- Cult Vans Gum<br />\nBrakes- Hybrid T/O’s<br />\nLevers- Avid Speed Dial Ti<br />\nCrank- Ultegra 6600<br />\nChainring- SRAM 46t<br />\nPedals- Look X-Track<br />\nFront Wheel- Road bike T/O<br />\nRear Wheel- Level Hub w/ 17t Cog and old Mavic rim<br />\nFront Tire-Maxxis Ravager 40c<br />\nRear Tire- Teravail Rampart 38c<br />\nPost- Vintage ControlTech<br />\nSaddle- Fabric Scoop<br />\nCages- Stainless King and Bontrager BAT cage<br />\nAccessories- Bontrager Adventure Frame Bag, Yanco Ramblin Roll, Spurcycle bell and a Wahoo Bolt Mount</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
