Since \"at least\" March, Twitter has been pushing to renegotiate the contract ahead of renewalâ€”unsurprisingly seeking to lower costs, Platformer reported.</p>\n<p>But now it's unclear if the companies will find agreeable new terms on time or if Musk already intends to cancel the contract. Platformer reported that Twitter is rushing to transition services off the Google Cloud Platform and seemingly plans to drop the contract amid failed negotiations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947152#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947152&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4e8bf71d7bdd5eb4edf6af1533d9b188d2e5fecfb8a4d1e79f775832ed3ae45f","category":"Tech"}
