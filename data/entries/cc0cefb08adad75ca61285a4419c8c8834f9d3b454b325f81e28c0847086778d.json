An import ban and a cease-and-desist order \non sales both take effect on Dec. 26 — unless President Biden \nreverses the decision by Dec. 25, which appears unlikely. \n(Presidents <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/\">rarely</a> overrule the <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/\">independent, nonpartisan \nagency</a>, which was <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub0000.pdf\">founded</a> in 1916 as the U.S. \nTariff Commission.) [...]</p>\n\n<p>Apple declined to provide an executive to speak on the record. The \ncompany’s position is that Masimo is pursuing a strategy of \nlitigation over innovation, hoping to generate a fresh stream of \nroyalties because royalties from past litigation have dried up. \nApple points out that the federal jury that deadlocked in May was \n6-to-1 for Apple, indicating that Masimo was a long way from \nmaking its case. </p>\n\n<p>This fight is far from over. “My goal isn’t just to beat Apple,” \nKiani told me in an interview last summer. “It’s to get Apple to \nchange its ways.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One way or another, I expect Apple Watch to remain available for sale in the U.S. But that deadline is just two months away.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/apple-watch-masimo-patent-suit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cc0cefb08adad75ca61285a4419c8c8834f9d3b454b325f81e28c0847086778d","category":"Tech"}
