It is simultaneously the largest and most powerful rocket ever built and the first launch system ever intended to be fully and rapidly reusable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026961#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026961&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e7ca806118f8330b2e4c14dd897f66469baf517d0f234219b038995d7914c6dd","category":"Tech"}
