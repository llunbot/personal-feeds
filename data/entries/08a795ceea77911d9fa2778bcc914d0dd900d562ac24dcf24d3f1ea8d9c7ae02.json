If you’re not familiar with BBB, they’ve been producing bike components, accessories and cycling apparel since 1998.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BBB’s FLUX lenses are a new offering that provides four different options for high-contrast, color-tuned optics. Three of the models are specifically ideal for road, MTB, or gravel riding, and the fourth is an all-conditions lens. The new FLUX lenses are available on BBB’s existing Chester sunglasses and the brand-new Valor model.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FLUX Lenses:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-closeup.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-closeup.webp\" alt=\"BBB FLUX lens, closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-closeup.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-closeup-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-closeup-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-closeup-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BBB’s most advanced lens to date, the FLUX lenses filter out non-essential wavelengths of red, green, and blue light to improve clarity and increase contrast. This helps your eyes perceive details, differentiate between colors, and experience less fatigue. The lenses allow for bright, high-contrast vision in all conditions, but there are four specific tints that cater to different riding styles.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-graphic.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"793\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-graphic.webp\" alt=\"BBB FLUX lens graphic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-graphic.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-graphic-297x196.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-graphic-120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-graphic-768x508.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The FLUX lenses also provide 100% UV-A and UV-B protection, plus they filter harmful blue light and infrared light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both sides of the lenses are protected with an anti-scratch coating. The outside of the lens also gets an oleophobic coating to resist water, mud, and dust. An anti-fog treatment on the inside of the lens helps fight off condensation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new FLUX lenses are available on the new Valor sunglasses and BBB’s updated Chester sunglasses. There are four different FLUX lenses available for road, MTB, gravel, and all-around riding:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red.webp\" alt=\"BBB FLUX lens, red\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-red-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FLUX Red:</strong> Intended for road riding, this lens allows 16.8% light transmission. The red lens filters out warm tones to enhance contrast on asphalt and cobblestones. It is suitable for sunny or cloudy conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue.webp\" alt=\"BBB FLUX lens, blue\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-blue-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FLUX Blue: </strong>Providing the most color enhancement of all the options, the FLUX Blue lens is ideal for gravel riders. This lens increases contrast on dirt pathways and works well for sunny or shady rides with a light transmission of 14.6%. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green.webp\" alt=\"BBB FLUX lens, green\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-green-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FLUX Green: </strong>Mountain bikers should opt for the green lens; which maximizes contrast from brown and yellow hues. This makes it easier to see roots, rocks, and trail surfaces. The lens also boosts green tones to separate the forest from the open trail ahead. The green lens allows 16% light transmission.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure.webp\" alt=\"BBB FLUX lens, pure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-FLUX-lens-pure-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FLUX Pure: </strong>If you want one pair of sunglasses that work well anywhere, the FLUX Pure lens is your all-conditions option. This lens enhances contrast to reduce eye strain for any type of rider. At 12.5% light transmission it is ideal for brighter rides but isn’t too dark for overcast conditions or shady forest patches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Valor FLUX Sunglasses:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-Valor-FLUX.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"772\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-Valor-FLUX.webp\" alt=\"BBB Valor FLUX sunglasses, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-Valor-FLUX.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-Valor-FLUX-297x191.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-Valor-FLUX-120x77.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BBB-Valor-FLUX-768x494.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Valor sunglasses feature a half-frame design.
