HashiCorp’s <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/infrastructure-cloud/security-lifecycle-management\">Security Lifecycle Management</a> portfolio helps companies inspect, protect, and connect their infrastructure by making the most secure path the easiest path for developers. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud#modern-experiences-at-the-edge-ai-security-and-open-source\">Google Distributed Cloud</a> (GDC) is Google Cloud’s air-gapped private cloud that does not require connectivity to Google Cloud or the public internet to manage the infrastructure, services, APIs, or tooling. GDC enables public sector organizations and regulated enterprises to address strict data residency and security requirements while continuing to deliver innovation to their users. GDC supports stringent requirements, including classified, restricted and top secret data. </p>\n\n<p>GDC now natively integrates with HashiCorp Vault Enterprise to add extra layers of protection and enhance developer, security and operator productivity. Vault Enterprise is a self-managed offering that can help organizations with strict regulatory requirements in highly regulated industries or the public sector. It can help secure access to sensitive data like financial data, health data, and personal identity information.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1726500867-gdc.png\" alt=\"Google\" /><h2>Mitigating risk in regulated industries with HashiCorp Vault</h2>\n\n<p>A regulated industry is an organization that is subject to government rules and regulations, and must adhere to specific standards and quality requirements. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure the safety, quality, and efficacy of products. </p>\n\n<p>HashiCorp Vault is deployed in public sector organizations and many regulated industries, including <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/industries/healthcare\">healthcare and life sciences</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/industries/financial-services\">financial services</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/industries/public-sector\">federal civilian government agencies</a>, law enforcement agencies, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Secrets and key management products are critical security solutions for regulated industries. <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/use-cases/secrets-management\">Secrets management</a> allows users to centrally store, access, and deploy secrets across applications, systems and infrastructure. This allows users to eliminate hard-coded credentials, keys, and tokens across different clouds and environments. Key management lets platform teams standardize distribution workflow and lifecycle management across KMS providers. This allows organizations in regulated industries to greatly simplify the lifecycle management of keys Vault has distributed and maintains centralized control of those keys in Vault, while still taking advantage of cryptographic capabilities native to the KMS providers. </p>\n\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n\n<p>HashiCorp Vault is now a Google Cloud Ready - Distributed Cloud solution, and is available to GDC customers directly in their high security environments through the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/application/ao-user/marketplace-overview\">GDC air-gapped marketplace</a> starting with the GDC 1.14 release. If you want to run Vault on GCP instead, you can access Vault through the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/hashicorp-marketplace-public/hashicorp-vault-gcp\">Google Cloud Marketplace</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Navigating the cloud in highly regulated industries at HashiConf</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/conferences/hashiconf\">HashiConf</a> is HashiCorp’s global cloud conference.
