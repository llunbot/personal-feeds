{"title":"Jumbo-Visma unveils its Vuelta a España lineup","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/jumbo-visma-unveils-its-vuelta-a-espana-lineup/","date":1628178166000,"content":"<div><div><p>Jumbo-Visma has confirmed its lineup for the upcoming Vuelta a España with Primož Roglič set to return to the race that he has won twice in a row.</p><p>The 31-year-old Slovenian, who pulled out of the Tour de France before stage 9 following a prior crash, is gearing up for a title defense at the Vuelta after securing the gold medal in the time trial at the Tokyo Olympics. He will have two opportunities to put his skill in that discipline on display at the Vuelta, which starts and finishes with time trial stages, and plenty more chances to put his elite climbing legs to the test.</p><p>Jumbo-Visma’s squad for the Spanish Grand Tour should also factor heavily in the high mountains.</p><p>Roglič will be joined by two-time Grand Tour stage winner Sepp Kuss, who said earlier this year – prior to Roglič’s withdrawal from the Tour – that he might be given a leadership nod at the Vuelta. It remains to be seen exactly what role he will play in the race with Roglič also in attendance, but the 26-year-old American proved to be on great form at the Tour de France, winning stage 15, which ascended to the highest point in the race.</p><p>2019 Tour podium finisher Steven Kruijswijk will also make the start for Jumbo-Visma, giving the Dutch WorldTour team yet another elite climbing talent. Kruiswijk has finished as highly as fourth overall at the Vuelta.</p><p>Robert Gesink, Nathan Van Hooydonck, Koen Bouwman, Lennard Hofstede, and Sam Oomen round out the Jumbo-Visma roster for the final Grand Tour of the season.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"413f7128b87cb0d0a0377eefc998f4cf3f69bb0d615181a3987d6ce1e102a341","category":"Cycling"}
