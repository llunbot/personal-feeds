[credit:\n                        Sam Machkovech                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n<p>For all the portable game systems Nintendo has launched, including mid-generation revisions, few have included cutting-edge upgrades to a key element: the screen.</p>\n<p>Historically, Nintendo has been in the back of the pack when compared to competitors' screens. The Game Boy's panels suffered heavy ghosting and lacked backlighting, for instance; they were handily surpassed in their time by the likes of the Game Gear and the Lynx. Only now, with no other dedicated handheld console to beat (for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/steam-deck-is-valves-switch-like-portable-pc-starting-at-399-this-december/\">at least two months</a>, anyway), has Nintendo offered a screen that made me say \"wow.\"</p>\n<p>This screen comes on the <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/P0VbxQ\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, a model going on sale later this week. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/new-nintendo-switch-production-to-begin-in-june-will-be-4k-when-docked/\">Rumors previously suggested</a> that the Switch OLED would run existing games better, in one way or another, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/meet-the-switch-pro-350-oled-model-launches-on-october-8/\">that didn't pan out</a> (or at least <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console\">not yet</a>). Instead, this week's new Switch OLED runs existing games on the same Nvidia Tegra X1 chipset. It copies the original portable/docked hybrid concept so well that you can use the new Switch with existing Joy-Cons, TV docks, and carrying cases.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800922#p3\">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800922&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86dc80f0af38fe80709255717784c7496c83ae6a36a3bbaa6f4d5af7bc540f7f","category":"Tech"}
