I wanted to start off by thanking all of you for reading this post. I know there is a lot of content out there to consume on Monday mornings but it means a lot that all of you return to this weird little corner of the bike media landscape and are reading this.</p>\n<p>Last year, after a long legal proceeding, Cari and I took ownership back of The Radavist and as we saw earlier this year, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-pros-closet-is-closing-tpc/\" target=\"_blank\">we did so at the right time</a>. The path that brought us to this very moment was not easy and we’ve learned a lot over the past year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RadavistGroupRideTucson-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RadavistGroupRideTucson-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RadavistGroupRideTucson-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RadavistGroupRideTucson-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>We Need More Memberships, Please!</h3>\n<p>Our Group Ride membership has been rolling along but I cannot emphasize this enough: <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\">we need you to sign up for our membership plan to keep The Radavist rolling along</a>. It’s $6.66 a month or $69.69 a year and every cent goes to paying our team and future improvements to The Radavist. Josh, Spencer, Travis, Hailey, Morgan, Ryan, and more all rely on these funds to get paid for their hard work.</p>\n<p>Without your membership support, we will not be able to maintain all the momentum we’ve gained over the last year.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/search/Group+Ride+Giveaway/\" target=\"_blank\">Each month we do a giveaway to The Radavist Membership subscribers where you can win complete bikes, drivetrains, and more!</a></em></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\">SIGN UP FOR THE RADAVIST MEMBERSHIP HERE AT THE RAD BAZAAR!</a></h4>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For 2025, we are renaming our subscription plan to <strong>The Radavist Membership</strong>, as we’ve learned its current name, Group Ride, is confusing.</p>\n<p>We’ll also streamline The Radavist Membership sign-up procedure in the coming weeks. Currently, I know it’s not the clearest message to have to sign up at the Rad Bazaar.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/RaDBaZAaR_stamp-1.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/RaDBaZAaR_stamp-1.png?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/RaDBaZAaR_stamp-1.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/RaDBaZAaR_stamp-1.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Rad Bazaar</h3>\n<p>Our biggest offering to you for supporting The Radavist through a monthly or yearly membership is <strong>the free content we produce here for all to read</strong>. A special thanks to our membership subscribers is the <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rad Bazaar</a>, a member-only selling platform of all things Radavist-adjacent.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, our web developer Ian took over the Rad Bazaar development from the great folks at Faculty, who designed it. We have big plans this winter, including a whole punch list of improvements to the user experience and organization of the Rad Bazaar. More on that as these developments come closer to launch.</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, you might have noticed that I haven’t been making <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/search/Saturday+Rad+Bazaar+Finds/\" target=\"_blank\">Saturday Rad Bazaar Finds</a> posts. It’s not because there aren’t tons of amazing items for sale in the Bazaar; it’s because I’ve been battling scammers. A lot of you have helped out with that and I appreciate it. The good news is, I’ve mostly cleaned the halls of the Bazaar from scammers but I need each and every one of you to remain diligent! <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/some-security-notes-on-the-rad-bazaar/\" target=\"_blank\">Read this post for more information</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re a small team over here and I’m personally handling all things Rad Bazaar.</p>\n<p>All this to say, if you haven’t used the <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rad Bazaar</a> to buy used goods or if you haven’t been over there just to drool, you should check it out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/PhoenixApril2024-77.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/PhoenixApril2024-77.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/PhoenixApril2024-77.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/PhoenixApril2024-77.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Trail Ahead</h3>\n<p>There’s a lot of uncertainty ahead in this world, but we’re dedicated to providing free cycling media that educates, informs, and entertains. I don’t like tooting our horn too much because I believe our work speaks for itself. It’s inspired a whole wave of other bike media that is now tuned-in to framebuilders, bike portraits, maker shop visits, vintage cycling, and more. We bust our butts over here and it comes from a place of love, relationships, and passion; we not are not doing it to chase clicks.</p>\n<p>Let’s keep the flame stoked and alive into 2025.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\">SIGN UP FOR THE RADAVIST MEMBERSHIP HERE AT THE RAD BAZAAR!</a></h4>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-radavist-membership-and-rad-bazaar/\">One Year of The Radavist Being Independent Again, Group Ride Membership, and Rad Bazaar</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"74289c322393ace0a43b9781e323911e1ca00fc457899a09fcdf1d9ac855f646","category":"Cycling"}
