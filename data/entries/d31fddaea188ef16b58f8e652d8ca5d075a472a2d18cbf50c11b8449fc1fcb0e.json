Remember those wheels the World Tour teams were rolling in the classics with the TPMS pressure sensor built in? Well, here they are, just in time for the summer races. Zipp’s updated 353 NSW and 303 SW, now come fully connected via SRAM AXS wireless connectivity, bringing real-time tire pressure monitoring straight to your bars (and phone).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zipp 353 NSW &amp; 303 SW aero carbon wheels integrate TPMS</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Zipp lifestyle 303 SW\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-lifestyle-303-SW--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos / Zipp)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many launches, this one comes with more than a few extra updates beyond that Zipp TPMS-equipped wheel headline. The most notable are new tires from Goodyear that work with the updated wheels. Then, new Zipp ZR1 SL hubs, 30g lighter than the ZR1 hubset, will now be sold as standalone components, as well. Lastly, the deep dish 454 &amp; 858 NSW wheels also get some of their own updates like ceramic bearings and weight savings. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-NSW-with-SRAM-AXS-TMPS.gif\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-NSW-with-SRAM-AXS-TMPS.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a long one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let’s start at the top with the new Zipp 353 NSW.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zipp 353 NSW: Tech-Heavy and Feather-Light</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7805\" height=\"5206\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Zipp Z1 SL hub wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--jpg.webp 7805w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-wheels--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 353 NSW is Zipp’s halo road wheelset—and now it talks to your AXS app. A tucked-in integrated AXS wheel sensor gives you in-the-moment tire pressure data, so you can tune performance on the fly without strapping a hockey puck to your valve stem. Think of it as direct-to-your-hub TPMS intelligence for dialing tire pressure with pro-level accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8188\" height=\"5444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Zipp 353 SW AXS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-jpg.webp 8188w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-297x197.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-1536x1021.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-768x511.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-353-SW-AXS-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At a claimed 1310g, this mid-depth wheelset is pretty light for something stiff and strong with a pressure sensor. Zipp’s latest carbon layup delivers a 16% bump in impact strength. Paired with the Sawtooth rim profile varying from 35-40mm depth, the 353 NSW balances climbing weight with aero chops and crosswind stability. It’s all anchored by the newly tweaked ZR1 SL hubset, with 66 points of engagement and silky ceramic bearings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rim is optimized for 30mm rubber, and Zipp’s collaboration with Goodyear in the Fitment Series makes picking the perfect match even easier. Don’t toss these on your gravel rig, though—they’re strictly for on-tarmac duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>353 NSW Highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1310g for the set</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tubeless-only, 25mm internal width</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hookless TSS rim profile</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30mm optimized tire width</li>\n\n\n\n<li>new ZR1 SL hub with ceramic bearings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Real-time tire pressure tracking via integrated SRAM AXS TPMS sensor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$3350 for the front &amp; rear pair</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zipp 303 SW: Road, Gravel &amp; Cobble-Crusher</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1969\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Zipp blur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--297x228.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--1536x1182.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--120x92.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--768x591.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-blur--2048x1575.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up: the 303 SW—Zipp’s road-to-gravel crossover wheelset. It carries the same AXS integration and hookless tubeless rim tech but focuses on all-road versatility. With a 40mm deep rim and a 25mm internal width, the 303 SW is tuned for 30-35mm wide tires, making it ideal for rougher tarmac, endurance events, and fast gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-353-NSW--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the 353, the 303 SW got a strength boost—up 10% in impact resistance thanks to revised carbon layups. A wider rim footprint and lowered tire pressures improves rolling resistance efficiency and reduces fatigue. More speed, less shake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the ZR1 hub here skips the ceramics in favor of stainless steel bearings, it’s still snappy and serviceable, with the same modular end caps and classic J-bend spoke compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>303 SW Highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1440g for the set</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hookless TSS tubeless rim</li>\n\n\n\n<li>25mm internal width, 40mm depth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ZR1 hubset with stainless steel bearings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Real-time tire pressure tracking via integrated SRAM AXS TPMS sensor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$2200 for the front &amp; rear pair</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Updates to the Deep Aero Big Guns: 454 &amp; 858 NSW</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full-.png\"><img width=\"3072\" height=\"3072\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full-.png\" alt=\"Zipp 858-NSW-TL full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full-.png 3072w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full--297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full--1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full--120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full--768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-858-NSW-TL-full--2048x2048.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zipp’s top-tier deep section aero wheels—454 NSW and 858 NSW—also get a touch-up. Both wheelsets now feature the lighter ZR1 SL rear hub (30g shaved off), ceramic bearings, and the signature 66 POE engagement. Rim profiles stay deep and wavy:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>454 NSW: </strong>53/58mm Sawtooth profile, optimized for 28mm tires.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>858 NSW: </strong>Massive 82/85mm rim depth, ideal for triathlon and time trials. Despite the depth, the weight is kept to 1500g thanks to TSE efficiency and hookless tubeless construction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>ZR1 SL Hubset: Now Also Sold Separately</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-tight-front--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-tight-front--1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Zipp Z1 SL hub tight front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-tight-front--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-tight-front--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-tight-front--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub-tight-front--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub--1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Zipp Z1 SL hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Z1-SL-hub--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Want a piece of the speed pie without springing for complete NSW wheels? The ZR1 SL hubset is now available on its own. It’s lighter, stiffer, and still approved for light-assist e-bike use (motors up to 60Nm). Available with ceramic or carbon steel bearings and a range of driver bodies—including XDR, HG11, MicroSpline, and N3W.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tire Time: Fitment Series by Goodyear</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Zipp Tenerife\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Zipp-Tenerife--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What good is a killer wheelset without the right rubber?
