But now that the first deliveries of the devices have started arriving in customers’ hands, it’s pretty clear that the Apple imitation is skin-deep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1eap2rj/galaxy_watch_ultra_misalignment/\" target=\"_blank\">picture posted by Redditor Ibuddhaa</a> shows their new Galaxy Watch Ultra with a display that’s misaligned with the faux depth marks on the bezel. It’s only off by a millimeter or two, but it’s enough to make the watch look like a cheap knockoff of a premium smartwatch. Ibuddhaa says every watch face is misaligned, suggesting that the issue stems from the display. Several responses to the original post say the issue isn’t present on their watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1eap2rj/galaxy_watch_ultra_misalignment/\">Galaxy Watch Ultra Misalignment </a><br /> by<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ibuddhaa/\">u/Ibuddhaa</a> in<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/\">samsung</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-suspend-shipments-3462708/\">Samsung announced</a> it was delaying the general release of its AirPods Pro clone (also known as the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro) to “urgently” assess and enhance its quality control processes following reports that the ear tips were tearing during the initial try-on. For those devices, Samsung “temporarily suspended deliveries of Galaxy Buds 3 Pro devices to distribution channels to conduct a full quality control evaluation before shipments to consumers take place.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not clear whether the Galaxy Watch Pro issues are a one-off thing or a symptom of something more widespread, but the buds issue certainly raises our eyebrows. And maybe the next time Samsung wants to take some inspiration from Apple, it should consider copying its build quality instead.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c0d0cf4dab8d09106f2560d6c151e796d3ee6407ead88b58f2b09c125571b43b","category":"Apple"}
