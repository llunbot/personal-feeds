Google says the feature is coming to iOS \"early next year.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nImportantly, at least as it <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10694388\">currently works on Pixel Phones</a>, any cloud backups of items placed in the Locked Folder are automatically deleted from Google's servers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle touts its photo and video backup service as \"a safe home for life's memories,\" thanks to the \"world-class security\" and encryption it uses \"to protect the photos that you back up or share.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite those safeguards, last year Google was forced to contact some 100,000 users to inform them that some of their private videos backed up on its servers had been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/04/google-photos-some-videos-sent-strangers/\">accidentally sent to strangers</a> due to a \"technical issue.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple still doesn't offer an equivalent feature is its native Photos app for iOS. It does include an option to hide certain photos from the main library in a \"Hidden\" folder which can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/hide-or-reveal-hidden-album-photos/\">literally hidden</a> in the Photos app, but even so, the album can still be seen when the image picker is used in third-party apps, so it's not completely invisible from prying eyes.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-photos/\">Google Photos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/\">privacy</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/29/google-photos-locked-folder-coming-ios/\">Google Photos 'Locked Folder' Feature for Pixel Phones Coming to iOS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-photos-locked-folder-feature-for-pixel-phones-coming-to-ios.2320466/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YUI--N3PuHw:xjV6JnrKPQo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YUI--N3PuHw:xjV6JnrKPQo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YUI--N3PuHw\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4f521b04f6812ffb96d098c734ee69168b90d0282d93713416b51740b579770a","category":"Apple"}
