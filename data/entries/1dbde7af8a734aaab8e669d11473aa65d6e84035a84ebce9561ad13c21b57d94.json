Siri is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/siri-is-still-bad/\">widely considered to be inferior</a> to other popular voice assistants, like Amazon's Alexa, and the rise of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini have set Siri even further back.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple went on to launch the HomePod mini in November 2020, before making the surprise decision to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">discontinue the full-size HomePod</a> in March 2021. At the time, Apple said that it discontinued the full-size HomePod in order to focus its efforts on the HomePod mini, but declining sales were also likely a factor. Somewhat unexpectedly, the HomePod then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/20/homepod-appreciating-in-value-following-discontinuation/\">started fetching higher prices</a> on resale marketplaces like eBay, and Apple decided to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/\">release a second-generation full-size HomePod</a> with some slight changes in January 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>What's Next?</h2>\r<br />\nThere have not been any rumors about a third-generation HomePod, but at least two other HomePod products are allegedly in the pipeline.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a January 2025 edition of his <em>Power On</em> newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">aiming to release a new HomePod mini \"toward the end of the year.\"</a> He said the speaker will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, but it is unclear if that change will have any consumer benefits. There is no word yet on what other new features are planned, but improved sound quality and a newer chip are safe bets. The current HomePod mini is equipped with the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/HomePod-With-Screen-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple is also rumored to be planning an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">all-new smart home hub</a>, which has been described as a HomePod with a screen. The device is expected to have a square iPad-like screen that can be attached to a speaker base, or it can be mounted on a wall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's smart home hub will reportedly feature a 6-inch or 7-inch display, along with an A18 chip. It would allow users to control smart home accessories, make FaceTime video calls, use Apple's intercom feature between rooms in a house, and more. It might even double as a home security system with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">Apple-designed smart home camera</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the HomePod with a screen would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/homepod-with-screen-after-wwdc-kuo/\">enter mass production in the third quarter of 2025</a>, but it is unclear if it will launch this year or next year. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">delayed the personalized Siri features</a> that are expected to be at the core of the device, so perhaps next year is a safer bet at this point. However, Apple could still provide an early preview of the home hub at any point now.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/homepod-turns-8/\">HomePod Turns 8: Here's When to Expect New Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-turns-8-heres-when-to-expect-new-models.2458244/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1dbde7af8a734aaab8e669d11473aa65d6e84035a84ebce9561ad13c21b57d94","category":"Apple"}
