These are also in new condition and come individually packaged in their original Apple retail packaging, as well as with a one year Apple manufacturer limited warranty.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>ZAGG</h2>\r<br />\nZAGG is offering a straightforward <a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-11043124-1465418060000\">25 percent off sitewide</a> for Mother's Day, including the usual array of Mophie chargers and protection accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/zagg-mothers-day-2025.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /><div><a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-11043124-1465418060000\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>25% OFF SITEWIDE</div>ZAGG Mother's Day Sale</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpecifically, you can get 25 percent off select products on ZAGG's website, excluding anything that has already been discounted.
