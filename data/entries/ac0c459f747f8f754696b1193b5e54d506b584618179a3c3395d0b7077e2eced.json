To help with this important decision, we have tested women’s bib shorts from some of cycling’s biggest brands as well as some smaller ones, which are worthy of equal attention.</p>\n<p>Many cyclists consider bib shorts to be the most essential item of clothing in their cycling wardrobe because they offer exceptional comfort and performance compared to waist shorts or baggy shorts.</p>\n<p>The women’s bib shorts in this list have been rated on overall comfort, chamois construction, hem and strap design, with the need for comfort breaks considered too. While price is always a consideration in our reviews, this women’s bib shorts best list should have something for most price points.</p>\n<p>If you’ve still got questions about bib shorts and whether they are right for you, keep reading until the end for our buyer’s guide to women’s bib shorts.</p>\n<h2>Best women’s cycling shorts</h2>\n<h3>Gore Distance Bib Shorts+ 2.0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Gore Distance Bib Shorts+ 2.0 Women’s\" title=\"Gore Distance Bib Shorts+ 2.0 Women’s - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gore’s Distance shorts are among the most comfortable bibs on the market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£200/$200/€200 as tested</li>\n<li>Super-comfortable chamois</li>\n<li>Soft and stretchy material with an excellent fit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gore’s Distance Bib Shorts+ 2.0 are sublime in comfort and we struggled to find fault with them.</p>\n<p>The chamois performs brilliantly and the fit is excellent. The shorts are targeted at riding long distances in comfort and are constructed from an ultra-fine knit polyamide/elastane mix, with a soft reinforced waistband.</p>\n<p>The wide bib straps are comfortable and secure, and the legs are laser cut with subtle silicone grippers that have a criss-cross print just inside the hem.</p>\n<p>We also really rated the inclusion of the ‘wind stopped liner’, where the chamois is stitched separately from the short outer at the front, which increases airflow.</p>\n<p>The only thing we can fault these shorts for is the sizing because according to Gore, our tester should have worn a couple of sizes up. For now, the best approximation seems to be opting for your UK-equivalent size in an EU size, or trying before you buy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/road-cycling-shorts/jersey-and-bib-shorts/gore-distance-bib-shorts-2-0-womens-review/\">Read our full Gore Distance Bib Shorts+ 2.0 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Petrichor Projects Women’s Bib Shorts</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Petrichor Projects Women's Bib Shorts for female road cyclists\" title=\"Petrichor Projects Women's Bib Shorts - 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Petrichor Projects Women’s Bib Shorts are premium and pretty much perfect.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rob Borek / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£149/$190/€174/AU$284 as tested</li>\n<li>Long-distance comfort</li>\n<li>Great fit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Petrichor Projects Women’s Bib Shorts are well-priced considering their quality and performance.</p>\n<p>Made from recycled materials, the women’s cycling shorts are comfortable on big rides.

To some, though, they can seem like an intimidating mess of straps, zippers and buckles that look uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>However, with new designs and high-tech features, women’s bib shorts are more accessible and versatile than ever before and, alongside the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-road-bike-saddles/\">best women’s road bike saddles</a>, bib shorts can make cycling a far more comfortable experience.</p>\n<h3>Why bib shorts over waist shorts?</h3>\n<p>The age-old decision between cycling shorts and bib shorts continually plagues many female cyclists who just want a comfortable ride. Cycling shorts are easy to figure out, unlike bibs that sometimes seem difficult to use.</p>\n<p>However, despite more complicated designs, most women decide they are simply more comfortable once they’ve given them a try. Here are some advantages bibs have over shorts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bibs don’t have an elasticated waistband that can restrict breathing</li>\n<li>Bibs prevent discomfort by reducing pressure around the waist</li>\n<li>Bib straps hold the shorts in place and prevent the chamois from moving around</li>\n<li>Bib straps prevent the rear end from sagging</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, bibs can be troublesome when a bathroom break is needed.</p>\n<p>Typically, you need to remove your jersey (and potentially your helmet and other outer layers) to use the loo with a traditional bib short design. This is tricky and chilly in the winter months.</p>\n<p>However, with the introduction of some innovative designs to help women ‘go on the go’, natural breaks aren’t an issue anymore.</p>\n<h3>Bib short features</h3>\n<h4>Bib straps (and other ways bib shorts stay up)</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Best women's bib shorts\" title=\"Best women's bib shorts\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A criss-cross strap design is common on women’s bib shorts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bib straps should hold the shorts securely in place without causing uncomfortable pressure on your shoulders. With many new strap designs recently hitting the market, there are plenty of options to choose from to suit your body shape and personal preferences.</p>\n<p>The more common strap designs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic straps – two parallel straps that run independently over the shoulders</li>\n<li>Halter tops – straps that connect at the back behind your neck</li>\n<li>Built-in baselayer – usually with a chest zipper. These remove the straps almost entirely, making the bibs more like a lightweight bodysuit</li>\n<li>Buckle systems – some shorts have buckle hooks on the straps that release easily for quick bathroom breaks</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Chamois</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Best women's bib shorts\" title=\"Best women's bib shorts\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s always advisable to get shorts with a women’s-specific chamois.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A comfortable chamois, or seat pad, is without a doubt the most important feature of any cycling shorts or bib shorts.</p>\n<p>Fancy straps and high-tech elements won’t make a difference if your chamois is uncomfortable and your ride is miserable. It’s best to try on different brands and different chamois to find the best fit for your body.</p>\n<p>It is a good idea too to choose a chamois that is women’s-specific, rather than a men’s or unisex design because it will be designed with women’s anatomy in mind and therefore be better fitting and more comfortable.</p>\n<p>A seamless chamois, or one with minimal stitching, is an ideal choice when shopping for bib shorts. Scratchy seams can rub and pinch sensitive areas and lead to a really uncomfortable ride.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure the chamois is made from soft material and the fit of the shorts is correct. Too much material will cause bunching and chafing; too little material won’t offer up enough padding.</p>\n<p>Beyond different designs, many chamois now also come complete with features such as anti-bacterial and anti-chafing materials. These features also contribute to comfort in different ways and can be much-appreciated additions.</p>\n<h4>Hems</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Best women's bib shorts\" title=\"Best women's bib shorts\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many brands now use gripper dots or dashes to hold the hem of the shorts in place.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Leg hems are another key feature to consider when shopping for bib shorts.</p>\n<p>If the hems are too tight, you could get the ‘sausage leg’ look, which is not only uncomfortable but extremely unflattering. However, leg bands that are too loose will cause the shorts to ride up and you’ll find yourself constantly tugging them down while riding.</p>\n<p>Another characteristic to consider is whether bibs have elastic or laser-cut leg hems. Elastic hems are better at keeping bibs in place and preventing the shorts from riding up. They also keep <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/arm-and-leg-warmers/\">knee and leg warmers</a> snugly in place for cooler rides. Unfortunately, elastic cuffs can often feel tight and uncomfortable against the skin.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, laser-cut hems are more flattering since they don’t have seams or elastic to constrict and contort your legs. These tend to be on pricier bib shorts and you might appreciate the less restrictive feel, especially on long rides.</p>\n<p>In either case, look for rubberised material on the underside of the hem. This will keep the bibs in place and play nicely with leg warmers. Although watch out for overly aggressive silicone grippers that can lead to skin irritation.</p>\n<h3>Common questions about bib shorts</h3>\n<h4>What about bathroom breaks in bib shorts?</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Petrichor Projects Women's Bib Shorts for female road cyclists\" title=\"Petrichor Projects Women's Bib Shorts - 06\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> To avoid having to remove all your layers for a wee stop, some bib short straps unclip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rob Borek / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The number one reason some women don’t wear bib shorts is because of the inconvenience when it comes to mid-ride bathroom breaks.</p>\n<p>Not only is this process time-consuming. It also leaves you exposed to the elements on cold days – not to mention out in the open for passing drivers and other cyclists to see.</p>\n<p>However, many of the newest women’s bib designs are making nature breaks easier and more modest, with innovative strap designs and buckle systems.</p>\n<p>These new designs enable riders to pull the shorts down without removing their jersey. Quicker comfort breaks mean more time riding and less time searching for ‘the facilities’ – something we can all appreciate.</p>\n<h4>How should bib shorts fit?</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"dhb Moda Women's Classic Bib Shorts\" title=\"dhb MODA Women's Classic Bib Shorts review-4\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bib shorts should fit snugly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When you’re choosing a pair of bib shorts, it’s worth remembering they are meant to hug close to the body.</p>\n<p>Often, tighter is better because excess fabric can lead to chafing. A snug fit will also mean the seat pad will stay in the right place when you’re riding. However, it is a balancing act. You don’t want the shorts to feel overly restrictive.</p>\n<p>Bib straps might feel tight over your shoulders when you try the shorts on, even if you’ve picked your normal size. This is because bib shorts are tailored to be worn on a bike.</p>\n<p>So one of the best tips for trying bib shorts on is to assume the position you would while riding by leaning forward and bending your arms. This will give you the best idea of how they’ll fit when out riding.</p>\n<h4>Should I wear underwear under my bib shorts?</h4>\n<p>The short answer to this question is, no. But don’t worry, it’s a mistake many of us have made because, frankly, putting on a pair of shorts with no underwear on can feel pretty strange at first.</p>\n<p>Chamois pads are designed to work best when they sit directly against the skin, and underwear can negate the benefits of a chamois. Your undies can create strange pressure points, unwanted friction and, in the worst cases, lead to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/health/how-to-avoid-and-treat-saddle-sores/\">saddle sores</a>.</p>\n<h4>What is chamois cream and should I use it?</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Best chamois creams collage showing four creams on white backgrounds.\" title=\"best chamois creams 2023\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some cyclists use chamois cream on longer rides, but many do without it.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-chamois-creams/\">Chamois cream</a> is an antibacterial viscose cream that helps eliminate friction between your skin and chamois seat pad.</p>\n<p>The idea is to stop any rubbing or friction, as well as prevent bacterial build-up, helping to stop you getting saddle sores or abscesses.</p>\n<p>Chamois cream is not essential but, as you may have gathered, it can help prevent some pretty unwanted complications.</p>\n<p>The best way to apply chamois cream is either to yourself at any pressure points between your skin and saddle or directly to the pad at the needed points.</p>\n<p>Make sure you wash your shorts after every wash to prevent build-up but, considering you’ll be using your shorts for exercise and likely without underwear, this is imperative anyway.</p>\n<h4>How much money should I spend on bib shorts?</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"dhb Moda Women's Classic Bib Shorts\" title=\"dhb Moda Women's Classic Bib Shorts\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> As with most things, you get what you pay for.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like most things in life, when it comes to how much to spend on bib shorts you get what you pay for.</p>\n<p>Many cyclists consider bib shorts to be the most essential bit of clothing for cycling because they do a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to staying comfy on the bike, so investing your cash in shorts is a wise idea.</p>\n<p>This is particularly the case if you’re cycling long distances or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a>, but less important if you’re on a budget, or using your shorts for commuting or shorter distances. Once you start to spend over £75/$95/€85, the returns on investment get more marginal.</p>\n<p>But this is often because over this price you’re paying for the prestige of big-name brands, more technical fabrics and more specific functions, such as waterproofing, aerodynamics or extra warmth for riding in cooler weather.</p>","author":"Katherine Moore","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ac0c459f747f8f754696b1193b5e54d506b584618179a3c3395d0b7077e2eced","category":"Cycling"}
