He says simply: ‚ÄúMac (üòâ) your calendars! We have an exciting week of announcements ahead, starting on Monday morning. Stay tuned‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jos-tweet-mac-announcement.png?w=997\" alt=\"Joswiak Mac announcement\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jos-tweet-mac-announcement.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1178w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jos-tweet-mac-announcement.png?resize=249%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 249w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jos-tweet-mac-announcement.png?resize=768%2C924&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jos-tweet-mac-announcement.png?resize=997%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 997w\" width=\"997\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>X / @gregjoz</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems to confirm that yes, there will be new Macs (as we all suspected) and no, there will not be a big Apple Event but rather several releases or news stories throughout the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Monday, October 28 is the day when Apple releases <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15.1</a>, the first releases with Apple Intelligence, as well as the new Hearing Aid feature for AirPods Pro 2. While not a secret, the OSes will likely be part of the first day of Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúexciting week of announcements.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We‚Äôre expecting several Macs to be announced, though the timing is unclear. There should be a new iMac with the M4 processor, a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html\">MacBook Pro</a> with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, and a redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a> with M4 and M4 Pro processors. The Mac mini, in particular, should be a big deal as it is expected to feature the first major product redesign in years.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a8ce0ef9ff0ad40f62ec8be4e32e14b74c1fa3f3503fcc051dd94dab61b0f255","category":"Apple"}
