Boasting insanely fast processors and all-new screen tech and sizes, the 2024 iPads are sumptuously designed and specced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining the work and entertainment capabilities of a laptop with the portability and convenience of a smartphone, the iPad has the potential to be the most versatile Apple device of all. Which makes it all the more disappointing that so many iPads end up as sofa computers with a very limited brief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel that you’re not getting the most out of your high-end tablet, or you’ve been holding off on upgrading because it doesn’t seem worth it for something you use to check your emails while watching Netflix, we’re here to tell you that the iPad can be far more. The key to harnessing its capabilities is to select the right accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose a great iPad accessory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need to consider is how much an accessory can expand your iPad’s scope as a convenient computing tool, and whether that upgrade is worth the cost. We should be examining value for money and return on investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad, for example, has one obvious weakness as a work tool, and that is its lack of a hardware keyboard; onscreen keyboards are versatile but they aren’t suitable for fast, accurate typing. Similarly, its vulnerability to drop and scratch damage makes it less useful for use on the go. And no matter how nice the screen is, it’s not much fun watching a two-hour movie on an iPad that you have to hold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessories that cost a fraction of the price of the iPad can solve all of these problems. It’s just a question of finding the right accessories. Luckily, we’re here to help you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introducing ESR’s accessories for the new iPad range</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for accessories that will upgrade your tablet from sofa gadget to powerful all-round computing tool, you’d be wise to check out ESR, a popular and well-established brand which has just <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/F9135B8D-2057-4C0D-8B0D-AD2E6D915F4F?maas=maas_adg_DED4E46A7AC29E22465073F31DB448A8_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled its accessories for the new iPad range</a>.
