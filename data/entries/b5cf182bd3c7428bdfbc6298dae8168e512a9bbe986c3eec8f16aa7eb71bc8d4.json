(You may recall them <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/13/wifi-dabba\">sponsoring previously</a>.) Dabba is a low-cost broadband internet service provider in India owned and powered by engineers and startup founders from around the world. Relative to its population, India lags behind most other countries in broadband penetration:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The US has 112M connections for 350M people</li>\n<li>China has 612M connections for 1.4B people</li>\n<li>India has only 30M connections for 1.4B people</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyone, anywhere in the world can help the Dabba network by buying a hotspot. It’s the bootstrapping and installation costs for new hotspots that are holding India back. Through Dabba, you help subsidize those costs. As a hotspot owner you can monitor the performance of your hotspot on their <a href=\"https://dabba.network/\">publicly available explorer</a>. It puts you in on the ground floor of a telecom with broad aspirations in an absolutely enormous market.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/14/dabba\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b5cf182bd3c7428bdfbc6298dae8168e512a9bbe986c3eec8f16aa7eb71bc8d4","category":"Tech"}
