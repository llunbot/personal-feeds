Among the initial features are enhanced writing tools for rewriting, summarizing, and proofreading text, as well as a new Siri user interface. Users can also expect notification summaries for various apps, including Messages and Mail, and a new \"Clean Up\" tool in the Photos app that can remove unwanted elements from images using generative AI.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, some of the more advanced Apple Intelligence features will be rolled out in subsequent updates. iOS 18.2, expected in December, will introduce ChatGPT support, Image Playground, and Genmoji for custom emoji creation. The full overhaul of Siri, which promises more precise app control and personalized responses, is slated for early 2025.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-release-ios-18-1-on-october-28/\">Apple Plans to Release iOS 18.1 With Apple Intelligence on October 28</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-plans-to-release-ios-18-1-with-apple-intelligence-on-october-28.2439318/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f627464a57970e36e971cd2c6126e6457e644cb952907955dd770c9b59e49fe","category":"Apple"}
