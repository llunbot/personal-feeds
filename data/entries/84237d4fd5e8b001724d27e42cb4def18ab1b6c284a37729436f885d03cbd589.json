It was a surprise move. The other defense witnesses—a former Theranos board member who joined the company in 2016 and a paralegal who provided a summary of the defense’s view of the case—were relatively small players.

Why? The defense didn’t call an expert to explain the psychological effects the alleged abuse had on Holmes, making certain events irrelevant to the case.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819207#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819207&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"84237d4fd5e8b001724d27e42cb4def18ab1b6c284a37729436f885d03cbd589","category":"Tech"}
