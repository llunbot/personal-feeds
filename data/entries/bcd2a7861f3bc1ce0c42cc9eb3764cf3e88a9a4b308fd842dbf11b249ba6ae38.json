The company shared this new classification system on Tuesday with employees during an all-hands meeting, aiming to provide a clear framework for understanding AI advancement. However, the system describes hypothetical technology that does not yet exist and is possibly best interpreted as a marketing move to garner investment dollars.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI has previously stated that AGI—a nebulous term for a hypothetical concept that means an AI system that can perform novel tasks like a human without specialized training—is currently the <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/\">primary goal</a> of the company. The pursuit of technology that can replace humans at most intellectual work drives most of the enduring hype over the firm, even though such a technology would likely be wildly disruptive to society.</p>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously <a href=\"https://time.com/6342827/ceo-of-the-year-2023-sam-altman/\">stated his belief</a> that AGI could be achieved within this decade, and a large part of the CEO's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-technology-can-go-quite-wrong-openai-ceo-tells-senate/\">public messaging</a> has been related to how the company (and society in general) might handle the disruption that AGI may bring. Along those lines, a ranking system to communicate AI milestones achieved internally on the path to AGI makes sense.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036853#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036853&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bcd2a7861f3bc1ce0c42cc9eb3764cf3e88a9a4b308fd842dbf11b249ba6ae38","category":"Tech"}
