And this is one of the podiums that you chase along the way.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/neah-evans-cyclist\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 88: Winning gold with Neah Evans</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-track-champions-league-mechanics\">At UCI Track Champions League, two mechanics turn spanners at the centre of the action</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-hour-record\">What is the cycling Hour record?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>How does the racing work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_4392-large.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>UCI</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With each category separated into two races – the sprint and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/japanese-keirin-sport-and-culture-beyond-the-velodrome\" target=\"_blank\">keirin</a> for the shorter distances, and a shortened scratch and elimination race for the endurance riders – the format is quite different to standard UCI track cycling, and designed for maximum drama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain’s Emma Finucane, sprint gold medallist at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-world-championships-2023-highlights\" target=\"_blank\">World Championships</a> this year, will once again take to the track. ‘It is really exciting how a sprint event or a keirin event can come down to literally a tyre length or less than a tyre length,’ she says. ‘Obviously, it is mentally really challenging and you can lose by a bike length or you can lose by a lunge. But also I like the fact that you can win by that too.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archibald will compete in the endurance events. ‘I find the scratch race hard to play safe,’ she says. ‘I think you have to take a gamble, there has to be something that you kind of lay out there. And if you want to not come off red in the face and frustrated.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frustrated was exactly what she was last year, unexpectedly dropped first in one elimination race and never quite recovering to push eventual champion, American Jennifer Valente.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson learned for this year’s elimination racing was ‘just don’t mess around. Push the pedals hard, that will always get you through.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiss rider Claudio Imhof came out on top in a thrilling battle for the Endurance League in 2022. He says, ‘Last year I really tried to pace all the racing and to be consistent. Two years ago I had some bad results in the first races in Mallorca so I went just for victories, all-in efforts afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But I will try this year to pace and try some tactical things – but not to lose it all already on the first night of racing.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The battle for the men’s Sprint League title: a repeat of last year? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_0954-large.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>UCI</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the big stories from the tournament is sure to be the rivalry between Dutch great Harrie Lavreysen – the most decorated male rider in the Champions League – and Australian Matthew Richardson, who pipped him to glory in last year’s Champions League Sprint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two went head to head in each final, with the crown on the line until the final race. Lavreysen says, ‘It’s crazy how consistent we were. I think my results last year were actually better than the year before when I actually won the title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think that’s an advantage. I think that dynamic is interesting, and I think races only get more interesting because we get to know each other.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richardson says, ‘There’s still 16 other people that you need to get through first to actually face each other. Obviously it kept happening last year, which I’m still kind of scratching my head about.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While cycling fans will be cheering for a repeat of last year’s drama, Richardson was guarded about the prospect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says, ‘You come into the next round with your guy, your rival, someone who’s a couple points away from you, but if you don’t make the finals against each other there’s no point thinking about it. You just have to take it race by race.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GB on the hunt for more medals</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP9_3068-large.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>UCI</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With eight riders heading to Mallorca, GB will be the nation with the most representation in the Champions League. After another successful year they’ll all have targets on their back, as Emma Finucane knows only too well. ‘It’s definitely hard [being well known now]. I found that out last year obviously, I was racing a lot more races against people and they were really really close. And I found that quite challenging.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archibald found this summer’s home games brought its own challenges, ‘It came with a lot of pressure that I didn’t necessarily enjoy, and I didn’t necessarily thrive under. So I struggle a bit with nerves, but we all do because I think it’s important to all of us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘And I can’t always shake that for something like the Champions League where although you might say it’s not <em>the</em> World Championships – the tagline is champion, a champion of champions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ll get nervous for just local track week, so I get just as nervous for this as well.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the stars were enthusiastic about the format of the tournament and how it fits into the calendar ahead of the Olympic Games. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s another good experience to expose yourself to,’ says Archibald, ‘that test of yourself because you want to go to higher and higher levels and if that means getting burnt on occasion along the way that’s almost what you want. So yeah, here we go, I suppose!’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>And onto the Olympics…</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/WP5_9978-large.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>UCI</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthew Richardson says one of the best elements of the Champions League series is the chance to practice for Olympic racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He describes it as ‘a prime opportunity to try and learn as much as you possibly can,’ especially for the possibility of a repechage for a position in the final.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I found that at the last Olympics, where you end up on the track in a three-up and almost have no idea how to race it, because you’ve never really done one before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You can stimulate races at home against people but if you don’t have the same level of depth as what you would at the Track Champions League, then it’s not really the same.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finucane is also keen to stress the fun side of competition, ‘I guess it’s a place where you [are] free to fail because there isn’t a lot of pressure on you. Also, it’s nice to meet new people, make new friends, and mix with other nations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think it’s a nice stepping stone for next year.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archibald came close but not close enough at last year’s event, and suggests her tactics this year should ‘perhaps be secret’. But the series will be crucial to her preparation for Paris too. She says, ‘It’s one thing to make an analysis of race videos and of certain riders and say this is what they typically do and this is how this typically turns out, but the exposure we can have weekend after weekend translates that into instinct rather than theory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I need quite a lot of theory going into a race, I need a race plan. I need a sort of direct notion of how I want it to go and if it doesn’t go that way, what will I do?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution, she says, is to ‘pace yourself and focus on the overall.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With five rounds of racing a crucial element is ‘having the sensation of being able to correct your mistakes weekend on weekend,’ Archibald explains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘And that’s the beauty of track cycling, back to back races. You can slap your handlebars and still think well, I’ll fix it next time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The future of track cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AW7_9577-2-large.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>UCI</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This summer saw the first ever combined UCI Cycling World Championships in Glasgow, featuring 13 different disciplines and combining para- and able-bodied cycling events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archibald says, ‘As a female athlete you’re far more aware of the benefit of being attached to something bigger than yourself, like with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Where there’s something iconic that people can attach themselves to it opens the door to something else, and suddenly there’s a celebration of the sport in more depth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That’s what we saw having para events alongside able-bodied events and then the crossover between BMX, mountain bike, road and track. That had a huge power to it. I have a lot of pride that that happened at home – that was very special for me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archibald’s ten-year stint with British cycling has witnessed other transformative changes. ‘In 2017 we had the first ever women’s Madison at the World Championships, in 2020 the first ever women’s Madison at the Olympic Games.
