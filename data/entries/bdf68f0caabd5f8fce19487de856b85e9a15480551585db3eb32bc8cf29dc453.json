Is a clean install better than a reinstall, or is it actually completely unnecessary to wipe your Mac first?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will then discuss the different ways to do a clean installation of macOS. Traditionally, the way was to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671308/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-macos-installer.html\">make a bootable copy of the macOS installer</a> on a USB stick and then reformat your drive before installing the bootable copy onto your Mac, however, this is unnecessary for modern Macs. There is now a simple method to wipe a Mac and it is possible to use macOS Recovery to reinstall the Mac operating system over the web (we have a separate tutorial about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671404/how-to-reinstall-macos.html\">how to reinstall macOS using Recovery</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, because on modern Macs macOS is installed on your Mac on a separate volume that can’t be touched by other apps and software on your Mac, reinstalling macOS as a means to fix problems is less likely to be the solution it once was.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you do a clean install of macOS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of reasons why you might want to do a clean install:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You might want to reinstall the operating system in order to correct problems with your Mac. Doing a clean install may be a good option if your <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668632/how-to-speed-up-a-mac.html\">Mac is running slow</a> or otherwise misbehaving.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Doing a clean install allows you to clear away old files that you might have been accumulating for years before installing the operating system onto a freshly formatted disk. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>A clean install is also something you should do before <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670942/how-to-sell-a-mac-or-macbook.html\">selling your Mac</a> or passing it on. It allows you to remove all your data from your Mac and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670927/how-to-erase-a-macbook-or-mac-restore-to-factory-settings.html\">return it to factory settings</a> for the next person.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A clean install is also something many computer users resort to when they are trying to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671430/how-remove-virus-mac.html\">get rid of a virus</a> (although there is a lot of debate about whether there are <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672879/list-of-mac-viruses-malware-and-security-flaws.html\">viruses on the Mac</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, changes in recent years may mean that a clean install is not necessary. Since macOS Big Sur (which arrived in 2020) macOS has its own volume which is completely sealed and cannot be changed by any software you install. In addition, if you wanted to do a clean install so that no leftovers that belong to an old macOS are carried along, this no longer applies because none of this information is carried over.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>CleanMyMac</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2624\" height=\"1740\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CleanMyMac\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2624w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C796&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1019&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1358&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CleanMyMac2024-2.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" alt=\"Editors' Choice\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/352922/cleanmymac-x-review-macos.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$39.95/a year for 1 Mac, $119.95 for 1 Mac (one time purchase)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://macpaw.audw.net/c/312327/2234841/1733\" target=\"_blank\">$39.95 at  MacPaw (first year, 1 device)</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://macpaw.audw.net/c/312327/2234841/1733\" target=\"_blank\">$117.95 at  MacPaw (one time purchase)</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Another reason to avoid a clean install is that it could result in the loss of data and settings you rely on. You may feel that you have a lot excess data and files on your Mac and that wiping your drive could be useful, just be prepared that it can be a risky business and you may end up deleting something important. Beware that a clean install can cause more problems than it fixes. You might prefer to use an application like <a href=\"https://cleanmymacx.macpaw.com/14\" target=\"_blank\">CleanMyMac X from MacPaw</a>, or one of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673271/best-mac-cleaner-vs-cleanmymac.html\">Best Mac Cleaner software</a> we have tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are happy to take the risk and still want to wipe your Mac and reinstall macOS – which you should definitely do if you are selling or passing on your Mac – read on!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to clean install macOS </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we explained above, there is more than one way to wipe your Mac and reinstall macOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use the Erase All Content and Settings option setting and use macOS Recovery to reinstall macOS via the web.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make a copy of the macOS installer on a USB stick, reformat your drive and then install the macOS onto your Mac from the installer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll start off with the simple option that works on modern Macs (all M-series Macs and the T2 Intel-powered Macs). </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3494564/erase-mac_monterey_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Erase Mac Monterey\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Before you begin: Back up your Mac </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you begin we recommend that you make a backup, just in case something goes wrong.

It’s entirely possible that there will be something on your Mac that you thought was in the cloud but was actually on your Mac (we speak from experience!) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that with regard to backups, you probably won’t want to recover a Time Machine backup if you don’t want to copy over all the settings and preferences associated with your old system. You could alternatively sync all your Documents and Desktop with iCloud rather than run a full backup, but make sure that everything you need is in the cloud and be aware that you may lose your settings and applications.

Make sure it’s called Untitled – rename it if necessary (this will help you enter the correct text in Terminal in the next steps).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a bootable installer has been pretty easy since the arrival of Mavericks in 2013 thanks to the Terminal command createinstallmedia that arrived in that version. Here’s how to use it (note that the name of the version of macOS will depend on which version you are installing):</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Terminal application on your Mac (find it by searching using Command + Space and typing Terminal)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now copy and paste the following text into Terminal (This text is for Ventura – we include the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/bootable-mac-installer-3575875/\">text needed for the other versions of macOS in this article</a>). When you cut and paste the following text into Terminal do check that it maintains the — as we have heard of people pasting in the — and it converting to –)<br />sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Ventura.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia –volume /Volumes/MyVolume (where MyVolume is the name of the external drive you are using – it could be Untitled).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Press Return.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your password (you won’t see the password appear).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Press Return again.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Terminal will warn that it is about to erase the drive. If you want to continue press Y and then Return. The process can take a while, you’ll see “Erasing Disk: 0%… 10%… 20%… 30%…100%…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Next Terminal will spend a few minutes copying the installer file to your drive. “Copying installer files to disk… Copy complete” and so on will appear in the Terminal window. Again, this can take a while – it took our Mac ages to go from 0% to 10%…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the bootable drive is prepared you will see the word Done. It can take a while.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you have the installer on the external drive you can use that to install copies of macOS on multiple Macs – which could be helpful if you are admin for a lot of systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you are reading this because you want to do wipe your Mac and do a clean install, read on…</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>4.</span>\n<h3>Wipe your Mac</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/show_all.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Wipe your Mac - view in Disk Utilities\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Now we are ready to install the copy of macOS from the installer drive on our Mac.

But for those running older Macs with older versions of macOS will need to use Disk Utility to delete their data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are running macOS Catalina or Big Sur you will have two volumes: Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD – Data. If you want to do a clean install of macOS over an existing installation you will need to delete the Macintosh HD – Data volume. We cover how to do this in more detail here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/reset-mac-3494564/\">How to reset and wipe a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macintosh HD – Data is where your data is stored separately to the macOS installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Either click on the – button or go to the menu and choose Edit &gt; Delete APFS volume.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will see a message warning you that this will permanently erase your data.

This seal is stored either in the T2 chip of the newer Intel Macs or in the Secure Enclave of the Apple M-series chip (aka Apple Silicon).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each component of the system is signed in hierarchical order, and any change to a component would also invalidate the seal that represents the top level. For further security, these Macs also do not start directly from the system volume, but from a snapshot of the system–and snapshots cannot be changed, even by the system itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So macOS itself cannot be changed by any software that you install as a user. Should a problem occur with macOS during a restart, perhaps because a storage space on the SSD is defective and thus a system component is no longer intact, this will be recognized by the startup process since the seal will now be invalid. Should this happen you will have to reinstall the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if your Mac boots up without issue then it indicates that there are no problems with the system. As long as your Mac works (which can be determined on the basis of the seal), the Mac is considered to be in working order as it complies with Apple’s specifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that reason, even if you do encounter problems on Macs with T2 chip or Apple Silicon while running macOS, it makes no sense to reinstall the system yourself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who want to do a clean install so that no leftovers that belong to an old system are carried along, this no longer applies because none of this information is carried over. All components are checked after installation, then signed and finally the entire system is sealed again. Again, the seal guarantees that everything is fine and that nothing untoward has crept in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is one component of the system software that is not installed on the read-only system volume. All other user-installed programs reside on the volume with the user data, including Safari. This means Apple can offer a separate update for the browser and WebKit, so that you do not have to reinstall the whole system each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of Safari and other apps there can be benefits in cleaning up your Library folder since it may still contain remnants of old applications you no longer use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"bdf68f0caabd5f8fce19487de856b85e9a15480551585db3eb32bc8cf29dc453","category":"Apple"}
