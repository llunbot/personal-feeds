Bodyreader claims Apple unfairly removed their app citing \"dishonest\" behavior, while also challenging the company's 30% commission on app purchases and its control over the iOS ecosystem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to court documents reviewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, Bodyreader argues that Apple's enforcement of App Store policies is inconsistent. The developer notes that after their original app was removed, they successfully published an identical app under a different name, \"Qilin Century,\" which remains available on the App Store. Closed-door hearings began Thursday and could conclude this week. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe hearing represents the first time Apple has been forced to defend its standard mobile platform practices against a Chinese developer. Earlier this year, Apple successfully fought off antitrust accusations from a Chinese consumer, but the company still went so far as to appeal to remove references to its market dominance from the ruling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBodyreader is seeking monetary damages, an apology, and a court declaration that Apple engages in unfair monopolistic behavior. The developer has also requested that Apple be required to allow third-party app stores and external payment links.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-china-lawsuit-antitrust-app-store/\">Apple Faces Epic Games-Style China Lawsuit Over App Store Practices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-faces-epic-games-style-china-lawsuit-over-app-store-practices.2442731/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f237d3a6250fa11224d835f2a9f70e6eb5d3ecb4e97462ac1f7c28b0ae48e6cf","category":"Apple"}
