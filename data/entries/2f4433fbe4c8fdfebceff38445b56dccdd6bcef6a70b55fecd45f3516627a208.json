There are a few vendors that offer laptops with extensive Linux compatibility. And then there are a select few that specialize in Linux laptops, support them, and even customize them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kfocus.org/\">Kubuntu Focus</a> is one of the select few. It sent me one of its laptops to test the <a href=\"https://kfocus.org/spec/spec-ir14.html\">Ir14 Gen 2</a>, which runs, of course, <a href=\"https://kubuntu.org/\">Kubuntu</a>, the KDE desktop variant of Ubuntu. The “Focus” in the company name comes from what it is hoping to provide: a device on which you can just do your work without worrying about what’s happening deeper in your system. Go ahead and <code>sudo apt update</code>, says the Focus team; we’ve got you.</p>\n<p>I used the Ir14 Gen 2 for Ars Technica work and my personal needs for at least two weeks. Setting the system up with Focus’ guided wizard, installing apps from its store, and refusing to touch any of the deeper system files, I achieved something pretty remarkable: no unexpected behaviors on a Linux laptop. Had anything gone wrong, I could reasonably lean back on the system’s rollbacks, which I used a couple of times with no problem.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051198#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051198&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f4433fbe4c8fdfebceff38445b56dccdd6bcef6a70b55fecd45f3516627a208","category":"Tech"}
