Prior to joining Apple in 2018, Field <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/24/tesla-motors-hires-doug-field-apples-vp-of-mac-hardware-engineering-to-lead-new-vehicle-development/\">worked at Tesla</a> and oversaw the production of the Model 3.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBefore working at Tesla, Field was Apple's Vice President of Mac Hardware Engineering, so this is the second time he has departed the Cupertino company. In total, he spent eight and a half years at Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nField is returning to Ford, which is actually where he kicked off his career as a development engineer. He's also had stints at Johnson &amp; Johnson, DEKA, and Segway. At Ford, Field will serve as chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer where he will work on AI, software, and hardware.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWork on the ‌Apple Car‌ could see a major setback with Field's departure, as the project has suffered from multiple leadership issues over the years. Field's return to Apple was largely seen as a major factor in Apple's decision to manufacture a full ‌Apple Car‌ rather than scaling the project back to a software focus. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple: “We’re grateful for the contributions Doug has made to Apple and we wish him all the best in this next chapter.” <a href=\"https://t.co/Trs0xNxL0o\">https://t.co/Trs0xNxL0o</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1435320561064890376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 7, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThat said, AI chief John Giannandrea is still leading the project, and Apple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/16/kevin-lynch-working-on-apple-car-development/\">recently brought on</a> Apple Watch lead Kevin Lynch to oversee the ‌Apple Car‌ development. We're not expecting to see an ‌Apple Car‌ until the mid to late 2020s at the earliest, so Apple still has some time to work out ongoing leadership woes.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-car-doug-field-joins-ford/\">Apple Car Executive Doug Field Departs Company for Ford</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-executive-doug-field-departs-company-for-ford.2309998/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZR_M1T_LkA4:wXetD8Rhg0g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZR_M1T_LkA4:wXetD8Rhg0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZR_M1T_LkA4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9806992cb5a190c45341ca1279847cf226ac58d9c173a232862cd90da7ff9980","category":"Apple"}
