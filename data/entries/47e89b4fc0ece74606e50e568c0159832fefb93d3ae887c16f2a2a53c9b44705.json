The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/a-45-gram-nine-function-multi-tool-the-pb-swiss-made-daysaver-is-super-light-compact/\" target=\"_blank\">Essential8</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/daysaver-coworking5-upgrades-big-capabilities-for-tiny-light-unique-multi-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">Coworking5</a> were already impressive little tools, but now they’ve taken customer feedback to make them even better. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Finish for Essential8</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-800x425.jpg\" alt=\"updated Daysaver essential8 coworking 5\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-800x425.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-768x408.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-1536x815.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new.jpg 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1148\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2.jpg\" alt=\"updated Daysaver essential8 coworking 5\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2-800x478.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2-768x459.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Essential8-multitool-new-2-1536x918.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Essential8, the updates are mainly in the finish with a new plasma-coated handle for better wear and oxidation resistance. The magnets inside the tool also get an additional epoxy coating added to the NiCuNi coating to improve corrosion resistance as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who wish to include a Phillips head screwdriver bit to the mix can replace the H2/H2.5 bit with the new H2/JIS bit. Meant to perfectly fit Shimano limit screws, the bit can also be used for Pozidriv and standard Phillips screws as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, you’re still getting 8 tools at just 33g with a 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8mm hex as well as a T25 Torx bit. The bits are held in by Neodymium magnets, and each bit can be used on either side of the main tool. The Essential 8 sells for $49.95. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Better Chaintool on Coworking5</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool.jpg\" alt=\"updated Daysaver essential8 coworking 5\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool-297x140.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool-800x376.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool-120x56.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool-768x361.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Coworking5-multitool-1536x722.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coworking5 is meant to pair perfectly with the Essential8 and adds a chain breaker, tire lever, spoke wrench, valve core tool, and a chain link holder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the chain breaker easier to use, the chain tool pin is now driven by the T25 bit which allows for more torque to be applied. It also features an increased thread diameter with a lower thread pitch to make it easier to drive the chain pin. The chain tool is compatible with 9-12 speed chains including SRAM Flattop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sold separately from the Essential8, the Coworking5 sells for $33.95. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are available now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://daysaver.fun/en-int/products/bike-multitool-extension-coworking5\" target=\"_blank\">daysaver.fun</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/daysaver-updated-essential8-coworking5-multitool/\">Daysaver Multitools Get Even Better with Updated Essential8 &amp; Coworking5</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"47e89b4fc0ece74606e50e568c0159832fefb93d3ae887c16f2a2a53c9b44705","category":"Cycling"}
