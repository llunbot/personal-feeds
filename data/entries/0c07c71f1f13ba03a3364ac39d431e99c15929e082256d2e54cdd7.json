{"title":"‘Six Colors, but Really Just One Color and It’s the Yellow iPhone 14’","link":"https://www.youtube.com/live/OpQSwUf39lA?feature=share&t=48","date":1678330308000,"content":"\n<p>Apple sent a bunch of reviewers the new yellow iPhone 14 (the yPhone? No? OK, I’ll drop it…), and Jason Snell, bedecked in yellow, went all-in with a livestream video. Serendipitously, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/109990066673973896\">I posted some photos on Mastodon</a> while Snell was streaming. My take: “Yellow iPhone 14 is a nice cheery fun yellow, but a very different nice cheery fun yellow than Playdate.”</p>\n\n<p>As Snell points out, Apple has been releasing mid-cycle new colors for the iPhone (and iPhone cases) for the last 4 or 5 years. They do the same thing with Apple Watch bands each spring — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BasicAppleGuy/status/1633105123281977344\">Basic Apple Guy has a nice gallery</a> of today’s new band lineup. There’s nothing new technically to review — just the colors. Apple’s strategy is obvious: with an annual schedule for truly new iPhones (and watches) each September, releasing new colors in March gives them a legitimate reason to keep using one of the most powerful words in marketing — <em>new</em> — for a product that is, by the breakneck standards of the phone industry, no longer all that new.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Case Review:</strong> Apple also sent me the new olive green silicone case for iPhone 14. Combined with the yPhone (OK, OK, I’ll stop, I swear, that’s it) it makes for a nice Oakland A’s-y vibe. I think the purple case they sent Snell probably makes for a better combo though.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/really-just-one-color-and-its-yellow\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"5dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0c07c71f1f13ba03a3364ac39d431e99c15929e082256d2e54cdd7","category":"Tech"}
