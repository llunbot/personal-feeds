The top-of-the-range Paralane 8.9 with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-ultegra-r8170-di2-review/\">Ultegra Di2 R8170</a> costs £5,199 / €5,299 / AU$6,999 (US pricing is to be confirmed).</p>\n<h2>“Look fast, go comfy”</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Down tube of Focus Paralane 8.9 endurance road bike\" title=\"FOCUS-MY24-PARALANE-8-9-fork-headtube-H4A6259\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The truncated NACA tube shapes offer a balance of aerodynamics, weight and comfort, according to Focus.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus </i></span></div>\n<p>The new Paralane frame uses a simplified version of the truncated NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) aerofoil shape introduced to the latest Izalco Max.</p>\n<p>On its race bike, the German brand claims this design saves 1 minute 45 seconds over 45km compared to the previous version (measured at 45kph).</p>\n<p>The pointed, leading edge of the tubes thickens and rounds off at the back. As a result, the Paralane has a similar silhouette to the Izalco Max.</p>\n<p>Look more closely and the taper of the Paralane’s tubes is pronounced, so the down tube and head tube are considerably thicker. Therefore, the Paralane frame weighs a claimed 1,130g in a size medium, about 300g heavier than the Izalco Max.</p>\n<p>Despite not having tested the Paralane in the wind tunnel, Focus says the new frame and updated cockpit should make it more aerodynamic than the previous generation.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bottom bracket of Focus Paralane 8.9 endurance road bike\" title=\"FOCUS-MY24-PARALANE-8-9-bb-H4A6264\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Focus says it picked a BSA bottom bracket for durability and serviceability.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>The new tube shapes also make the frame 15 per cent lighter and three per cent more compliant overall, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>However, the bottom bracket and head tube are said to be 29 per cent and 19 per cent stiffer respectively to improve responsiveness and power transfer.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Izalco Max, which uses a D-shaped aero seatpost, the Paralane has a round seatpost for improved comfort.</p>\n<h2>Practical integration</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"front-end of Focus Paralane 8.9 endurance road bike\" title=\"FOCUS-MY24-PARALANE-8-9-computer-mount-H4A6270\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The integrated computer mount comes with adaptors for Wahoo and Garmin head units.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Paralane now comes with the Focus CIS Technology stem, which is compatible with round, 31.8mm handlebars.</p>\n<p>In this ‘cockpit integration system’, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-brake-gear-cables-explained/\">brake and gear cables</a> pass beneath the stem into the headset.</p>\n<p>This reduces front-end drag while also making it easier to attach a handlebar bag, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>Focus supplies the Paralane with an integrated out-front <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> mount.
