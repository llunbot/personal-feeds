With the Messages app <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/\">set to gain RCS support</a> on iOS 18, it is possible the text effects will also work with green bubbles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOur hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options alongside the text effects, but we have not confirmed that possibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the text effects and RCS support, the Messages app on iOS 18 will reportedly gain an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/\">AI-powered autocompletion tool</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a refresher, RCS support will provide an improved messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices compared to the current SMS standard. Just like iMessage, RCS features higher-resolution photos and videos, audio messages, typing indicators, read receipts, the ability to send messages over a Wi-Fi network, and better functionality for group chats.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18 is set to be unveiled during the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/\">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately after the presentation. The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/\">Messages</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-imessage-text-effects/\">Exclusive: iOS 18 to Add Text Effects to iMessage</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/exclusive-ios-18-to-add-text-effects-to-imessage.2427827/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ca4a30c041f6aa515fb5c137851da86083ddbfbfa9c9a4435746d2fe08b61b6","category":"Apple"}
