They’re also not compatible with 10, 11, or 12-speed drivetrains. BTCHN’ bikes have been there… so they made this <a href=\"https://www.btchnbikes.com/components/paulcrankadapter\" target=\"_blank\">PAUL crankset adapter</a>. This is 3D printed in aluminum and will bolt up to your Paul Crankset using their factory chainring bolts. It will adapt to any 104BCD chainring using standard 1x chainring bolts while maintaining the original chainline.</p>\n<p>First debuted at the 2022 MADE Bike Show and pre-ordering now for $95.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.btchnbikes.com/components/paulcrankadapter\" target=\"_blank\">BTCHN Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/btchn-bikes-paul-crank-adapter/\">BTCHN’ Bikes Paul Crank Adapter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b1958f58df44b10e807540e91bd2cf739b966778776594ff5b8ffa7b91de9d81","category":"Cycling"}
