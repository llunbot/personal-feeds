This is for mountain biking, gravel racing on the chunkiest roads (like the Roubaix!), and CX on days that make for the best photos. It is compatible with most bikes that use a 1x drivetrain with a front derailleur mount or ISCG-05 mount. It will work with round and oval chainring sizes from 28-62T and chainlines of 45-51mm depending on frame specs and geometry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>8mm of chainline adjustment via our GuideLock quick adjustment system. No shims required.</li>\n<li>Infinite vertical adjustment between 28 and 36T for round chainrings and 28-34T oval chainrings</li>\n<li>Loosen one screw to flip the guide out of the way for easy chain removal without losing any of the guide’s adjustments</li>\n<li>All adjustments made with common 4mm hex key</li>\n<li>Designed for the rigors of Enduro, heavy trail, mud and even DH riding, the Wolf Tooth engineers made this guide extremely stiff and strong while keeping it light at 44g</li>\n<li>Specific guide shaping is optimized for use with oval and round chainrings</li>\n<li>Installation takes just a few minutes – no need to remove your crank arms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=1f8f513b-b98b-4cf0-abf5-e477c8747e9c&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wolftoothcomponents.com%2Fcollections%2Fchainguides\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wolf-tooth-gnarwolf-chainguide-rev2/\">Wolf Tooth GnarWolf Chainguide rev2</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"8e78dc0c116d092fd1d01d601921d5b1bb50dece869d1eacb674493ce5b6aa5b","category":"Cycling"}
