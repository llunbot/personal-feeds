There are three Apple One tiers: Individual, Family, and Premier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/Apple-One-Apps-Feature-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1012\" height=\"601\" />\r<br />\nOver the last month, the highest-end ‌Apple One‌ Premier plan has gained two additional perks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is what Apple One Premier already included, for $37.95 per month:<ul><li>Apple Music</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple TV+</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple Arcade</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple News+</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple Fitness+</li>\r<br />\n<li>iCloud+ with 2TB of storage</li></ul>Here are the two new perks, at no extra cost:<ul><li>Apple Invites</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple News+ Food</li></ul>Last month, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/apple-launches-new-invites-app/\">released a new Invites app</a> that allows iCloud+ subscribers to create invitations for any occasion, such as birthdays, dinner parties, graduations, baby showers, and more. The app is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-invites/id6472498645\">available on the App Store</a> for the iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-invites-screenshots.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAnyone can RSVP to an invite from the Apple Invites app, even if they do not have an Apple Account or an Apple device, but creating an invitation requires an iCloud+ subscription. And since iCloud+ is included with all Apple One plans, including the Premier plan, this is  a new perk to take advantage of at no additional cost.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second new perk is Apple News+ Food.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe upcoming iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates add a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-news-plus-food-ios-18-4/\">Food section to the Apple News app</a> on the iPhone and iPad. This section will provide Apple News+ subscribers with tens of thousands of recipes and other food-related content from well-known food-related publishers, including Allrecipes, Bon Appétit, Food &amp; Wine, Good Food, and Serious Eats.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-News-Food.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nHere is how Apple describes the new Food section:<blockquote>With the new Food feature, users will be able to find stories curated by Apple News editors, as well as browse, search, and filter tens of thousands of recipes in the Recipe Catalog — with new recipes added every day. The beautifully designed recipe format makes it easy to review ingredients and directions, and a new cook mode takes step-by-step instructions to the full screen. Users can also save their favorite recipes for later and access them offline.</blockquote>iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are currently in beta. The updates will be released to the general public in April, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple News+ is available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. It is included in the Apple One Premier plan only, so the new Food section will be another perk that comes exclusively with that tier.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-one-premier-gets-two-more-perks/\">Apple One's Best Plan Now Includes Two More Perks For Free</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ones-best-plan-now-includes-two-more-perks-for-free.2452700/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b9bd29a0b713fb55efa3eebec6d4b0178238a79b7d4f75d0c7fd99013dcaa8e9","category":"Apple"}
