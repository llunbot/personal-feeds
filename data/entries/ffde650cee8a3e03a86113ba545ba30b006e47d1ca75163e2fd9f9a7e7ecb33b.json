Since then, Apple has added a handful of iPad-exclusive features, but overall, it’s still a lot like iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That could change dramatically in iPadOS 19 (iPadOS 26), due to arrive at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> and ship in September. We’ll have a chance to see what Apple has in mind at the keynote on June 9. In the meantime, here’s what we know about the next version of iPadOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated June 4 2025: </strong>9to5Mac reports on several new features in iOS 26 that involve Messages, Notes, CarPlay, and Music.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 19: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Full version: September 15 (predicted)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The official release date has not been announced, but Apple currently has an annual cycle with its operating systems that happens in the September timeframe. Based on recent history, iPadOS 19 could be released to the public on September 15 or 22. There have been years when iPadOS has arrived later alongside macOS in October. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>Here are the release dates for the past version of iPadOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPadOS 18: September 16, 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPadOS 17: September 18, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPadOS 16: September 12, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPadOS 15: September 20, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPadOS 14: September 16, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPadOS 13: September 24, 2019</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 19: Compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2565370/report-ios-19-will-support-all-iphones-released-since-2018.html\">report in December 2024</a> stated that the following iPads will be able to run iPadOS 19:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Pro (2018 or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (3rd generation or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (5th generation or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (8th generation and later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s nearly every iPad that can run iOS 18, excluding the 7th-gen iPad from 2019.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 19: Developer and public betas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer beta: from June 9 (expected)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public beta: from July 14 (estimated)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple makes betas of its operating systems available before the official release in September. A developer beta is released first following the WWDC keynote, so developers can immediately begin testing it with their products. The WWDC25 keynote will be held on June 9, so the developer beta should be available later that day after the keynote presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple then releases a public beta for everyone else, which usually arrives in July, about a month after the first developer beta. Then, whenever Apple issues beta updates, the updated public beta follows a day or two after the updated developer beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in using the beta, you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">join Apple’s beta program</a>. The beta program involves running software that will have some stability issues, and you are expected to provide Apple with details of any issues through the Apple Feedback app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For help installing iPadOS beta on your iPad see our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/ios-beta-latest-how-get.html\">guide to the iOS 19 beta</a> (the method is very similar). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 19: Name could be iPadOS 26</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, it’s been easy to predict what the next version of iPadOS will be called. iPadOS takes the same version number as the version of iOS, so for 2025, it was widely expected that the name would be iPadOS 19. However, that may not be the case. Apple is rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2796806/report-apples-wwdc-os-design-overhaul-will-bring-new-branding-too.html\">aligning all the names of its operating system updates</a> to reflect the year. So rather than having <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 19</a>, iPadOS 19 and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">macOS 16</a> (which is so confusing). It will be iPadOS 26, iOS 26, and macOS 26. This makes a lot of sense, so we hope that Apple does this as it will be a lot less confusing for everyone!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 19: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because iPadOS 19 never needs to leave Apple Park until it ships, rumors of its new features are harder to come than iPad hardware. But leaks still occur, and we’ll keep track of them here. Here’s what we’ve heard so far:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Major design overhaul</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is working on a design overhaul of iPadOS (as well as iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS). Reports state that the update will take its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2234788/ios-18-mimic-vision-pro-interface-sketchy-report.html\">cues from visionOS</a>, and the Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2598036/apple-launches-brand-new-invites-app-infused-with-ai.html\">Invites</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2243614/apple-unveils-new-sports-app.html\">Sports</a> apps could offer some hints at what is in store. It’s also possible that Apple changes the icon shape for the first time to match the visionOS’s circular icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac-like user experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One exciting feature rumored to be on the way is a new window management system for multitasking on the iPad. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1341608/stage-manager-ipados-windows.html\">released Stage Manager</a> with iPadOS 16.1, but it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1341608/stage-manager-ipados-windows.html\">hasn’t lived up to its potential</a>. An April 2025 report from Mark Gurman claims that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2763642/rumor-ios-19-and-ipados-19-will-bring-all-new-multitasking-to-the-iphone-and-ipad.html\">Apple is working on Stage Manager 2</a>, which will incorporate the use of a menu bar that activates when the iPad is connected to a keyboard. Gurman added that iPadOS 19 will make the iPad “more like a Mac,” but he did not offer specifics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A separate report from November 2024 claims that users will be able to <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-will-introduce-important-changes/\">pin files to the iPadOS 19 Home screen</a>, similar to the way files can be saved to the desktop in macOS.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPadOS 18 Battery settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ipad-battery-settings.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Low Power Mode could expand its functionality in iPadOS 19.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Low Power Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>iPadOS 18 currently has Low Power Mode, but Majin Bu last November <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-will-introduce-important-changes/\">claimed that the system will be “reinvented”</a> in iPadOS 19. That could mean it will lean on Apple Intelligence to manage and optimize battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Intelligence and Siri</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has hit some <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2638224/report-apple-internally-acknowledges-ugly-and-embarrassing-siri-delays.html\">serious hurdles</a> with its Apple Intelligence development, causing features to be delayed. Features that were supposed to be delivered in iPadOS 18.4 may appear sometime in 2026 in an iPadOS 19 update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple had touted a major update to Siri, where it is better at natural conversations with the user. Previously expected in iPadOS 19, it is now more likely to come as a later update or in iPadOS 20. However, there will almost certainly be new Apple Intelligence features as part of iPadOS 19, especially since all new iPads (except the 11th-gen model) can now run it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Games app </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2795595/ios-19-will-reportedly-include-a-dedicated-gaming-app.html\">dedicated gaming app</a> coming with iPadOS 19 (or 26), according to a report from Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The App will be available for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV, it is claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new app will tap into the App Store’s games section and Apple Arcade, according to Gurman. It will also offer editorial content about new games and centralize everything currently found in Game Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Home app</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will reportedly make <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2562280/apples-home-strategy-for-2025-and-what-it-means-for-the-homepod.html\">a major push into the smart home</a> over the next year, and that could start with a new Home app. Numerous reports claim that Apple is developing a new “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePad</a>” and a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2635442/apples-smart-home-hub-delayed-to-align-with-dramatic-ios-19-launch.html\">HomePod with a display</a> that features a new “homeOS,” and Apple recently <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2633285/apple-will-soon-force-everyone-to-use-the-new-home-app.html\">pushed all users to the new Home architecture</a> first released in iOS 16. To go along with these new products, could present a whole new Home app in iPadOS 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Messages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>9to5Mac <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/\">reports</a> that Messages will be able to automatically translate messages using AI. Messages will also let users create polls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Music and full-screen animated lock screen artwork</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>9to5Mac <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/\">reports</a> that animated album art will now display on the lock screen when using the Music app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Notes and Markdown support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>9to5Mac <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/\">reports</a> that users will be able to format their entries in the Notes app by using <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\">Markdown</a> syntax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Calendar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2791509/apple-job-posting-confirms-calendar-revamp.html\">new Calendar app</a> based on Mayday app (which Apple acquired last year) relies on AI to help manage your calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div><figcaption>The iPad: You either love it or you don’t give it much thought.
