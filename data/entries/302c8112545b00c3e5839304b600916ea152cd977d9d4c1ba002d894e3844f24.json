Hosted by BoneshakerMTB and Gremlins Bicycle Emporium, we couldn’t be more stoked with how everything came together. This year’s event was a true celebration of vintage mountain biking, attracting enthusiasts from as far as New York, Montreal, and Vancouver, all gathered to share their passion for vintage bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The turnout was incredible, 1,500 visitors over the course of the weekend, including 600 on opening night. Many returned multiple times to explore the collection further. The energy was amazing, and we couldn’t be happier with the feedback we received. It’s clear that a lot of people are just as excited about vintage mountain biking as we are!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-07.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-07.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This year, we showcased an expanded collection of vintage bikes, spanning from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, and introduced 35 new bikes to the lineup. Our display featured iconic bikes from brands including Rocky Mountain, Yeti, and Fat Chance, along with some classic Klunkers from Cook Bros, Ritchey and more. A standout was the Ritchey P-22 exploded bike, which was a real crowd pleaser and had its own rich history and story (having been welded by Ritchey, Brodie and later repainted by Dekerf.) It hung above display cases of vintage Paul Component derailleurs, and a true Canadian heritage Syncros box of parts and deadstock gear!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-08.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-08.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-08.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-08.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-09.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-09.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-09.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-09.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-015.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-015.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-015.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-015.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This year, we also focused on enhancing the experience with engaging off-bike activities. One of the highlights was the custom pinball machine we built in collaboration with Nitto, MKS, and Crane Japan. The pinball game offered a fun way for people to interact with the show, and win exclusive prizes. It was exciting to see the reactions of those who scored big, with bells ringing, pedal spinning, and cheers echoing throughout the venue.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-06.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-06.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-011.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-011.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-011.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-011.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>We were hyped to have created a show-exclusive t-shirt designed and screen printed in Toronto! With generous donations from Strisdland and House of Looptail helping us host a raffle, the grand prize, a custom 1995 GT HTS-3 built by Gremlins Bicycle Emporium, added an extra level of excitement to the event’s conclusion.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-013.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-013.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-013.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-013.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-01.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-01.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Boneshaker_2nd-Annual-Vintage-Mountain-Bike-Show-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This year’s show was a huge success, thanks to the amazing support from our community and the continued enthusiasm of bike collectors like Mike Berlin, and Lucas Longman.
