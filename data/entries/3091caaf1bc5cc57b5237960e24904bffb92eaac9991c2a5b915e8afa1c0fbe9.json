But the only number anyone really cares about is how far a vehicle can go on a single charge. Rightly or wrongly, US car buyers have decided that the long charging times for a BEV (relative to refueling with liquid hydrocarbons) must be offset with enormous range. And when it comes to a long-legged BEV, there's a new king of the hill.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued its official range rating for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/everything-we-know-about-the-lucid-air-electric-vehicle/\">the Lucid Air</a>. The Air was probably going to do well here—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/independent-testing-confirms-the-lucid-air-has-a-range-of-517-miles/\">Lucid-commissioned independent testing</a> determined that a combination of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/this-will-be-the-most-aerodynamically-efficient-electric-car-in-production/\">a very low drag coefficient</a> and a hefty 113 kWh battery pack would deliver over 517 miles (832 km) of range. But the EPA says Lucid has done even more than that: the Air Dream Edition has been rated at 520 miles (837 km) on a single charge.</p>\n<p>\"Crucially, this landmark has been achieved by Lucid's world-leading in-house EV technology, not by simply installing an oversize battery pack,” said Peter Rawlinson, CEO and CTO of Lucid Group. \"Our race-proven 900V battery and BMS technology, our miniaturized drive units, coupled with our Wunderbox technology endow Lucid Air with ultra-high efficiency, enabling it to travel more miles from less battery energy.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795568#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795568&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
