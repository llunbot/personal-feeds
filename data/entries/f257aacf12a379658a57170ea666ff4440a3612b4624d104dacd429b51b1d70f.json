For customers who want a larger or higher-end desktop, Apple recommends pairing the 27-inch Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom the report:<blockquote>Apple will not be making an Apple Silicon version of the 27-inch iMac to replace the Intel-equipped model that it discontinued in 2022. The company is instead focusing the iMac line around the 24-inch model that was first released in early 2021 and just updated with the new M3 processor this fall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple PR representative Starlayne Meza confirmed the company's plans to The Verge. The company encourages those who have been holding out hope for a larger iMac to consider the Studio Display and Mac Studio or Mac mini.</blockquote>Apple has only ruled out a new 27-inch iMac, so a larger-screened iMac is still possible. Last month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/\">developing an iMac Pro with a 32-inch display</a> for release in late 2024 or in 2025. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/\">also expects</a> a 32-inch iMac with mini-LED display backlighting to launch in 2025.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-imac-pro/\">2025 iMac Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/\">Apple Says There Won't Be a 27-Inch iMac With Apple Silicon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-there-wont-be-a-27-inch-imac-with-apple-silicon.2410027/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f257aacf12a379658a57170ea666ff4440a3612b4624d104dacd429b51b1d70f","category":"Apple"}
