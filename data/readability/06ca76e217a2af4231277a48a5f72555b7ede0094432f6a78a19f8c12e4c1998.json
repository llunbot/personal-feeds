Castro de Herville<br><strong>Distance: </strong>202.2 km</p><p>An intriguing final road stage. This isn’t a big mountain stage but rather what the Vuelta’s technical director Fernando Escartín calls a “mini Classic”. After an easy start, the second half is all up and down.</p><p>There are five “short but tough mountain passes” for the riders to conquer, including the Alto Castro de Herville (9.7 km at 4.8%) which concludes the stage. This is a stage reminiscent of Il Lombardia and it should make for some interesting racing.</p><p><strong>Who’s it for: </strong>Probably a breakaway.</p><p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks: </strong><em>While none of the five categorized climbs are all that intimidating individually, all told they will make it tough for anyone without strong climbing legs to shine on this stage. I like the chances of riders like Michael Storer, Romain Bardet, and Damiano Caruso from the break. If it comes down to the GC riders, however, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Primož Roglič nab the win in the red jersey.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-vuelta-profile-stage20.jpeg\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stage20.jpeg\"></figure></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"06ca76e217a2af4231277a48a5f72555b7ede0094432f6a78a19f8c12e4c1998","category":"Cycling"}
