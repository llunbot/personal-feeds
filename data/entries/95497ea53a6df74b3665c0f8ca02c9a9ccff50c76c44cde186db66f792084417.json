They were announced abruptly via a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/03/applecare-memo-potential-hardware-announcement/\">somewhat</a> unexpected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max/\">press release</a> on December 8, 2020 and went on sale the same day. Orders started arriving to customers one week later on Tuesday, December 15.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods Max‌ offer many popular AirPods features such as the H1 chip, easy pairing, Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, automatic switching, and Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, but in a premium over-ear design for the first time. They also offer a headband made of a flexible mesh canopy, replaceable magnetic earcups, a Digital Crown for physical volume controls, a button for switching between ANC and Transparency, and a Smart Case for storage and to put the headphones into a low power state.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDemand for the ‌AirPods Max‌ was high immediately after launch, with shipping estimates that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max-shipping-estimates/\">stretched out several months</a>. Initial <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/airpods-max-unboxing-videos/\">reviews of AirPods Max were favorable</a>, applauding the headphones for being \"more than enough to compete with other high-end headphones.\" While the recommended retail price remains at $549, the ‌AirPods Max‌ are often <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods\">available with discounts</a> of over $100.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods Max‌ have also been subject to criticism since their launch, including for their price <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-max-vs-sony-wh-1000xm4-and-bose-nc-700/\">relative to rival sets</a> of high-end over-ear headphones, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/28/third-party-airpods-max-solutions/\">design of the Smart Case</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/airpods-max-owners-ear-cup-condensation/\">condensation</a> inside the earcups, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/19/airpods-max-excessive-battery-drain/\">poor battery life</a> (something that was later <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-max-battery-drain-firmware-fix/\">fixed via a software update</a>), and ANC strength seemingly being <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/airpods-max-anc-performance-reduced/\">reduced over time</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-announces-new-airpods-max/\">refreshed the AirPods Max</a>'s selection of color options and swapped the Lightning port for USB-C, but there were no other changes. Since the changes were so minor, Apple does not seem to consider the \"new\" model a second-generation. There are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airpods-max-2-not-yet-planned/\">currently no rumors</a> about a true, second-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ model, so the current version is likely to stick around for a while longer despite its age.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/08/airpods-max-announced-four-years-ago/\">AirPods Max Announced Four Years Ago Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-announced-four-years-ago-today.2444880/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"95497ea53a6df74b3665c0f8ca02c9a9ccff50c76c44cde186db66f792084417","category":"Apple"}
