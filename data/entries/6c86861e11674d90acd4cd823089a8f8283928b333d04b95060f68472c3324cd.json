(photo/Shimano)\" /></p>\n<p>Along with the much-anticipated and exciting news of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?p=385658\" target=\"_blank\">new XTR Di2 wireless components</a>, Shimano is also releasing an updated version of its top-tier cross-country and gravel pedal, the XTR PD-M9200. Shimano is also debuting a special edition of its flagship S-Phyre XC903 that is offered in an exclusive XTR-inspired silver colorway. These new shoes give XTR aficionados the ability to truly go full XTR. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano XTR PD-M9200 Pedal Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the all-new XTR drivetrain components, the updates to the pedals appear to be relatively subtle, more of a refinement than an overhaul. In fact, they look nearly identical to the existing <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-xtr-m9100-actual-weights-pricing-design-story-more-photos/\">M9100 pedals</a>, although some minor changes to the shape of the pedal body distinguish the two models from each other. The main giveaway is that the outboard end of the axle is flat on the new version, versus the sculpted look of the previous. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the new XTR PD-M9200 pedal from an angle. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_1_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S1.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the new XTR PD-M9200 pedals from above\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PD-M9200-shic6-primary_3_zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_L_S3.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The new XTR PD-M9200 pedals. (all photos/Shimano)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>XTR PD-M9200 Specs and Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dual-Sided SPD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lower platform height for pedaling stability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Step in and out consistency</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open binding design for mud shedding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjustable spring release tension for personal adjustment</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 314 grams (pair)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best Paired with SHIMANO XC903 MTB Race Shoe or RX801 Gravel Race Shoe</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MSRP: $220 USD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the new M9200 pedals are built around Shimano’s long-standing SPD system. For 35 years and counting, SPD has set the benchmark for clipless pedals with its incredibly consistent performance, and it continues to impress. Like its predecessor, the new XTR pedals have a very minimal, sculpted pedal body with a slim profile and open binding design. The portions of the pedal body surrounding the axle on both sides of the binding mechanism provide a small platform to interface with the pontoons/tread lugs of stiff-soled shoes for lateral stability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a stout chrome-molly spindle and sealed cup and cone bearings, the new pedals should provide the same legendary durability and low-maintenance that Shimano pedals are known for. The PD-M9200 is offered in a standard axle length or a -3 mm short axle version for those seeking to narrow their Q-factor/stance width. With a claimed weight of 314 grams for the pair, the new version weighs the same as its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Special Edition S-Phyre XC903S Shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the S-Phyre XC903S shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SH-XC903S-shic138-primary_2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The S-Phyre XC903S, now in XTR-inspired silver.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate the launch of the new XTR components, Shimano is offering its <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-s-phyre-xc903-mtb-shoes-review/\">top-of-the-line S-Phyre XC903</a> XC, gravel, and CX race shoes in a special edition colorway. With a shimmery silver upper, these look to combine the race-winning performance of the Shimano XC9 shoes with a color honoring the legacy of Shimano’s top-level mountain bike components.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>S-Phyre XC903S Shoes Specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weight: 307g (size 43)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Color: Silver</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stiffness: 11</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Standard Sizes: 36-48, half sizes available 39.5-46.5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wide Sizes: 38-48, half sizes available 39.5-46.5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MSRP: $450 USD, €419.95 EUR, $649.95 AUD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“We created the S-PHYRE XC903S to celebrate the latest generation of XTR and provide riders with a shoe that reflects the premium craftsmanship and performance of our flagship mountain bike components,” said Jessie Gascon, SHIMANO Soft Goods Product Manager. “This  limited-edition model embodies the highest standards of racing technology and showcases the style and power of XTR.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the XTR-inspired color and metal BOA dials, the S-Phyre XC903S shoes are essentially identical to the current XC903 off-road shoes. And we think that’s a good thing, given that they are among the best racing shoes on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678.webp\" alt=\"A mountain biker riding with the new XTR PD-M9200 pedals and special edition S-Phyre XC903S shoes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Girona-7678-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Now you can show your love of XTR with special edition shoes to go with the fresh new XTR Di2 group. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>XTR PD-M9200 Pedals and Special Edition XC903S Shoes: Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new XTR PD-M9200 pedals and special edition S-Phyre XC903S shoes, as well as the new XTR component group, are available now on Shimano’s website.
