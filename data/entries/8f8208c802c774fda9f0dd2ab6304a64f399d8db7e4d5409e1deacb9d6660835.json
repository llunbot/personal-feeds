In 2022, TQ was leading the charge with its then-new and revolutionary <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tq-hpr50-ebike-motor-harmonic-pin-ring-transmission/\">HPR50 drive system</a>. Built around the brand’s Harmonic Pin-Ring Transmission, this motor was pivotal in the development of a new breed of lightweight e-bikes like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-fuel-exe-emtb/\">Trek Fuel EXe</a> and others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not content to rest on its laurels, TQ is launching its brand-new HPR60 drive system, which builds on the success of its predecessor and claims to improve upon it in several ways. With a claimed 20% increase in torque, a 17% increase in power, improved cooling, a new display, and more battery options, the HPR60 aims to redefine lightweight e-bikes all over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1.webp\" alt=\"Riding a TQ-HPR60 equipped mountain bike with the optional range extender battery attached.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_05-1-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With its compact form, the HPR60 makes it easier for brands to fit motors on bikes with less disruption to suspension designs and kinematics. (All photos/TQ)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to TQ, “the development of the HPR60 has never been about peak torque or power. It’s always about feeling empowered. It’s about climbing faster and riding longer to enjoy more of what’s most fun without being held back by a massive weight penalty and cumbersome bike.” Let’s dig into the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>TQ-HPR60 Upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re just interested in the quick hits, here’s what TQ has upgraded compared to the existing HPR50 drive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>+10 Nm of torque — resulting in a 20% increase in power</li>\n\n\n\n<li>+50 W motor power — resulting in a 17% increase</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved cooling concept for higher thermal stability</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased efficiency</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduced noise emissions for even quieter operation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>High-resolution color display with extended functions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New battery options: 290 Wh and 580 Wh</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PI_DriveUnit_HPR60_Exploded_2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1258\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PI_DriveUnit_HPR60_Exploded_2.webp\" alt=\"Exploded view of the TQ-HPR60 drive system.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PI_DriveUnit_HPR60_Exploded_2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PI_DriveUnit_HPR60_Exploded_2-297x187.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PI_DriveUnit_HPR60_Exploded_2-1536x966.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PI_DriveUnit_HPR60_Exploded_2-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PI_DriveUnit_HPR60_Exploded_2-768x483.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>TQ’s Harmonic Pin Ring Transmission enables the compact form and low weight of the HPR60 drive system. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>TQ-HPR60 Drive Unit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new HPR60 has the same compact form factor as its predecessor. In fact, the fitment is the same, so riders with HPR50 motors could swap those out for the new HPR60 if they choose. Additionally, it weighs in at a claimed 1.92 kg, which is impressively lightweight. For reference, that’s just ~70 grams heavier than the HPR50, but it boasts a 20% increase in torque and a 17% boost in peak power. Now with up to 60 Nm of torque and 350 W of peak power, TQ says that the HPR60 has the highest torque density of any drive system on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02.webp\" alt=\"A mountain bike riding on a bike equipped with the new TQ-HPR60 motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LS_HPR60_MTB_02-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If TQ’s press shots are any indication, we can expect some exciting new bike models soon.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the HPR50, the HPR60 employs TQ’s Harmonic Pin-Ring (HPR) Transmission, which TQ says “is the result of decades-long experience in the engineering and development of electric motors for robots, satellites, space stations, and Mars rovers.” Compared to the cog systems more commonly used in e-bike motors, HPR uses two spline rings that interface together, with just a single step to achieve its low reduction ratio. This means fewer parts, a smaller size, and a lower weight. As such, the entire motor system is built concentric to the bottom bracket surrounding the crank spindle. You can learn more about how it works in this <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tq-hpr50-ebike-motor-harmonic-pin-ring-transmission/\">article about the HPR50</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That lower reduction ratio results in a motor that TQ claims is quiet and “barely audible.” On top of that, they claim that the motor response is virtually instant, drag-free, and very natural-feeling. The HPR60 features three pedal assist modes, which are customizable through the TQ app. With a Q-factor of just 135 mm, it offers a stance width that’s more comparable to analog bikes than bulkier motor systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TQ-HPR60-batteries.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1399\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TQ-HPR60-batteries.webp\" alt=\"The three battery option for the new TQ-HPR60 drive system.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TQ-HPR60-batteries.webp 1399w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TQ-HPR60-batteries-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TQ-HPR60-batteries-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TQ-HPR60-batteries-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Three battery sizes provide more flexibility for brands when designing their lightweight e-bikes. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Battery Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the HPR50 was only offered with a single battery size — 360 Wh — TQ now offers a total of three different sizes. In addition to the 360 Wh, the 290 Wh and 580 Wh sizes have been designed “to deliver the best ratio of weight to capacity in their class thanks to featuring the highest energy density on the market.” In fact, TQ claims that the HPR60 motor and 290 Wh battery (plus remote and display) combine to create the lightest e-bike system in its category, with a weight of just 3.53 kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With compact dimensions and claimed weights of 1.46 kg (290 Wh), 1.83 kg (360 Wh), and 2.70 kg (580 Wh), these batteries should allow manufacturers to make bikes that look and feel more like analog bikes. Riders hoping for more range will be happy to know that the battery capacity can be increased with an optional 160 Wh range extender. Weighing a claimed 960 grams, the range extender is reportedly the size of a 500 ml water bottle and attaches via a Fidlock mount or certified bottle holders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9.webp\" alt=\"TQ's updated new display and remote for the new HPR60 drive system.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cockpit_clean_16x9-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The new top-tube integrated display and low-profile remote for the HPR60 drive system.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TQ’s new 2-inch O-LED full color display is designed to seamlessly integrate into the top tube of the bike frame. The display’s location should help protect it from damage while being relatively easy to see while riding. TQ states that it should be “perfectly readable under all light conditions” with all of your pertinent ride info available at a quick glance. Additionally, the display button also powers the system on and off, riders can connect to the system via the TQ app, and it is compatible with all ANT+ bike computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remote</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest HPR60 remote doesn’t look much different than the existing remote for the HPR50. This low-profile unit mounts discreetly on the handlebar next to the left grip with a simple and easy-to-use button layout. Unlike some wired remotes, the TQ remote can be unplugged from its cable, which should make it easier when swapping bars or changing out other components.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9.webp\" alt=\"The Yeti MTe lightweight e-bike with the TQ-HPR60 motor.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Studio_Yeti_16x9-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The brand-new Yeti MTe lightweight e-bike is one of the first to come with the new HPR60 motor. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What About TQ-HPR60 Equipped Bikes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The TQ-HPR60 launches today, and it’s fair to assume that we’ll be seeing several new lightweight e-bike models featuring this new drive system very soon. Launching concurrently with the motor is the new Yeti MTe lightweight e-bike in the photo above. The MTe is a brand new model in Yeti’s lineup, and it has 145 mm of rear travel paired with a 160 mm fork. We’ll follow up with more details on this bike soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TQ has previously teamed up with brands like Trek, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-voltage-eride-stretches-out-155mm-lightweight-tq-powered-all-mountain-ebike/\">Scott</a>, Rotwild, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unno-ikki-long-travel-emtb-keeps-things-low-light/\">UNNO</a>, BMC, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-spectralonfly-emtb-mixes-all-mountain-kis-stability-with-light-tq-power/\">Canyon</a>, and more to produce various lightweight eMTB, e-road, and e-gravel models. Based on the photos provided by TQ, we’re seeing some not-so-subtle hints about another bike we can probably expect to see in the not-too-distant future.
