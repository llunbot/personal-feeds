A central glazed oculus brings natural daylight into the interior and contains a dynamic artificial-lighting system that adjusts based on the time of day. The building connects the mall's central atrium to a rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInside, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels. The main floor is a floating deck that sits above the primary display area. The Forum, where Today at Apple sessions take place, is located on this floating deck, providing a central location for workshops and events. The upper level, which connects directly to the rooftop park, brings natural light and greenery into the store through a continuous glass facade. The interior features high-quality materials such as natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-trx-interior.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple The Exchange TRX runs on 100% renewable energy and is carbon neutral, in line with Apple's broader environmental goals. The store contains a Genius Bar, a dedicated Apple Pickup counter, and more than 160 retail employees to help customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo celebrate the store's opening, Apple will run a special series of Today at Apple sessions called \"Jom Discover,\" running from June 22 through July 6.
