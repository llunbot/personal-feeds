It is now entirely PFAS-free – so at least one more product that won’t be leeching ‘forever chemicals’ into our world. And surprisingly enough, Rapha made the new Gore-Tex jacket lighter than ever, even if it took a bit of slightly sneaky tactics to shed those few extra grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket goes PFAS-free</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_on-body.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_on-body.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket is PFAS-free, side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_on-body.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_on-body-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_on-body-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_on-body-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_on-body-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Rapha)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha’s newest light, breathable, and fully-waterproof Gore-Tex jacket is made to be “hard-wearing and ultra packable”. But most importantly, it was made to be better for the environment. Old Gore-Tex used PFAS ‘forever chemicals’ to keep water out, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rapha-gore-tex-shakedry-jackets-new-ultimate-for-riding-in-cold-wet-weather/\" target=\"_blank\">their ShakeDry</a> was a specific offender. So all those old waterproof solutions had to be redesigned from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest version addresses those concerns, and at the same time promises improved durability thanks to a new 3-layer fabric construction that is as light as the lightest old Gore-Tex solution, even with the extra outer protection layer. And as you’d hope, it is “guaranteed to keep you dry.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not quite as stretchy as before, so Rapha had to refine the cut a bit to make the fit perfect. But it looks like they’ve dialed in a great new packable waterproof road riding jacket, as long as you can stomach the ever-higher cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In 2021, our materials team started exploring new technologies that could match our performance expectations without the use of PFAS chemicals that can harm the environment… After years of global wear testing and refinements, Rapha released our first PFAS-free GORE-TEX jacket last Autumn. Now, we are proud to introduce this durably waterproof innovation to our Pro Team range. The result is the ultimate rain jacket for giving your best in the worst racing and training conditions.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Anne Weir, Materials Developer at Rapha </em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>How is it lighter, but not quite as packable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-goes-PFAS-free_approximate-120g-actual-weight.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-goes-PFAS-free_approximate-120g-actual-weight.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket is PFAS-free, 120-130g actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-goes-PFAS-free_approximate-120g-actual-weight.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-goes-PFAS-free_approximate-120g-actual-weight-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-goes-PFAS-free_approximate-120g-actual-weight-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-goes-PFAS-free_approximate-120g-actual-weight-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-goes-PFAS-free_approximate-120g-actual-weight-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha says it is their lightest jacket ever. And my first impression is that sounds legit. I have only had a chance to hook my Large sample onto a hanging scale (which is only accurate to +/- 10g) but my jacket weighs ~120g. Compare that to 133g for my large <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/exclusive-rapha-pro-team-gore-tex-jackets-game-changing-shakedry-color-visibility/\" target=\"_blank\">pink ShakeDry</a>, and it seems there are some real weight savings, even if tiny. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Official Rapha claimed weight for a size M is 128g.)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket is PFAS-free, up close detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_zip-and-taped-seam-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get that savings lightweight Rapha Gore-Tex Jacket is barebones. No longer is there even a small mesh internal stuff sack pocket. Just a 2-way zip to make it easy to access your jersey’s pockets underneath. Thankfully there is still a loop to hang it to dry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the slightly heavier ShakeDry version packed down into its mesh pocket as small as my fist, this new material isn’t quite as compressible. It is still plenty packable, and of course incrementally lighter. But now you should expect that it will fill one jersey pocket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it doesn’t have its own stuff pocket it’s a bit harder to quantify packed dimensions exactly, but I would say it squishes down to about 2x my fist. Still very small. Still easy to get into a jersey pocket or small bag. Just not quite as tiny as before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PFAS-free details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket is PFAS-free, dark\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_pretty-dark-with-limited-visibility-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The core rationale behind this new lightweight Rapha Gore-Tex jacket was to limit the amount of harmful chemicals being put out into the world. While the performance of ShakeDry was excellent, a closer look at the chemicals used to make it shed water revealed the Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) used in manufacturing basically don’t degrade. So once they end up polluting the world, they are there forever. Hence the nickname ‘forever chemicals’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha explains that the new Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket is “made without intentionally added per- and poly-fluorinated substances”. What that means is that there could still be some ‘trace amounts’ of PFAS in the final product. Just that Gore-Tex &amp; Rapha worked to create new waterproof materials and clothing that didn’t rely on specifically adding PFAS coatings for it desired performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket  – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_all-black-but-with-reflective-rear-detailing.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_all-black-but-with-reflective-rear-detailing.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket is PFAS-free, black with reflective stripes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_all-black-but-with-reflective-rear-detailing.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_all-black-but-with-reflective-rear-detailing-297x267.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_all-black-but-with-reflective-rear-detailing-120x108.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-Gore-Tex-Jacket-is-PFAS-free_all-black-but-with-reflective-rear-detailing-768x691.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha’s all-new Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Jacket goes on sale today for $390 / 335€ / £295, either directly from Rapha, their own Clubhouse stores, or partner shops. And unfortunately in my opinion, it seems to be only available in one almost-black dark gray colorway with reflective rear stripe details, at least for the time being. Fingers crossed that Rapha will figure out a colorful version for improved wet weather &amp; low-light visibility soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those keeping score at home, that’s about 30% more expensive than the previous ShakeDry version of their lightweight, packable &amp; breathable Gore-Tex waterproof road riding jacket. But, at least this one should now be a lot gentler on the environment, not adding more harmful microplastics and unnecessary ‘forever chemicals’ into the ground and water where we ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://rapha.cc\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha.cc</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rapha-pro-team-gore-tex-jacket-is-their-lightest-ever-now-more-durable-pfas-free/\">Rapha Pro Team Gore-Tex Jacket is Their Lightest Ever, Now More Durable &amp; PFAS-free!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f640700b8295c985b5e5cb56cccf27b43d43af40354f5e6b08cc181f8fc2eeba","category":"Cycling"}
