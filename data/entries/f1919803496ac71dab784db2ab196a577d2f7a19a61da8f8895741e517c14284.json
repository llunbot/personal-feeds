{"title":"Front Page Tech on a New UI Style for iOS 19, Back on January 17","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE","date":1741654819000,"content":"\n<p>Jon Prosser, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE\">in a YouTube video</a> with mocked-up animations showing exactly what he’s talking about, 51 days ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today we have your very first exclusive look at the changes coming\nto iOS 19 — with a redesigned camera app and possibly ... a\nredesigned iOS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basic idea is something very much akin to the look and feel of VisionOS, but brought to the Camera app, and perhaps throughout the entire system (or just parts of it) in iOS 19. Seems cool, seems fresh, and seems aligned with where Apple has been heading.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s Parker Ortolani, himself a talented designer with a particularly keen eye for trends, <a href=\"https://parker.micro.blog/2025/02/04/apple-invites-screams-that-an.html\">writing on his blog February 4 after Apple Invites debuted</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The rumored <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/introducing-apple-invites-a-new-app-that-brings-people-together/\">Apple Invites</a> app has arrived. While I\nobviously haven’t had much time to play with it, I have quickly\nbrowsed through the UI and wanted to share some observations. The\nlast new Apple app, Apple Sports, already felt out of place in iOS\n18. It has a more visionOS or watchOS-like design language\nutilizing colorful backgrounds, glassy floating UI elements,\nexpanding buttons, and lots of layered shapes. Apple Invites takes\nit all even further. It’s got big beautiful cards, translucent\ncells, big bold buttons, and an emphasis on content. It feels so\nclearly like a hint of what is to come in a future iOS update.\nIt’s almost screaming it in our faces. It seems awfully suspect\nthat Apple’s two latest apps have a whole new design language that\ndoes not mesh with the rest of the OS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now comes today, with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16\">Mark Gurman dropping this vagueness at Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The revamp — due later this year — will fundamentally change the\nlook of the operating systems and make Apple’s various software\nplatforms more consistent, according to people familiar with the\neffort. That includes updating the style of icons, menus, apps,\nwindows and system buttons. As part of the push, the company is\nworking to simplify the way users navigate and control their\ndevices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because\nthe project hasn’t been announced. The design is loosely based on\nthe Vision Pro’s software, they said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s it. No screenshots. No mockups. No specific description of the changes. Just “loosely based on the Vision Pro’s software”. Jon Prosser not only said this was coming, but commissioned full, realistic animations to illustrate it, <em>51 days ago</em>. And astute observers like Ortolani <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlDeXwQSay8\">and others</a> have observed, for over a month, that Apple itself is starting to hint at this new design language in its own already-shipping new apps for iOS.</p>\n\n<p>I’m so old I remember when YouTubers made videos about months-old Gurman stories, not the other way around. There’s weak sauce, and then there’s eating paste.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/10/fpt-ios-19\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f1919803496ac71dab784db2ab196a577d2f7a19a61da8f8895741e517c14284","category":"Tech"}
