The move is expected to primarily affect Apple, since many popular Android devices already feature USB-C ports.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2018, the European Commission tried to reach a final resolution on the issue but it failed to come into law. At the time, Apple warned that forcing a common charging port on the industry would stifle innovation and create electronic waste as consumers were forced to switch to new cables.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eu-charging-standard-proposals-and-apple/\">The EU Wants All Phones to Work With Interoperable Chargers, Hereâ€™s What That Means for Apple's Lightning Port</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA European Commission impact assessment study conducted in 2019 found that half of all charging cables sold with mobile phones had a USB micro-B connector, 29 percent had a USB-C connector, and 21 percent had a Lightning connector. The study suggested five options for a common charger, with various options that cover ports on devices and ports on power adapters.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast year, the debate was reignited as the European Parliament <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/31/eu-votes-in-favor-of-charging-cable-standard/\">overwhelmingly voted in favor</a> of a common charger, citing less environmental waste and user convenience as the main benefits.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe executive branch of the European Union is currently drafting the legislation, according to sources speaking to <em>Reuters</em>, which is expected to be presented next month.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/\">Lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/\">Europe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/eu-law-could-force-usb-c-iphone/\">EU Law That Could Force the iPhone to Switch to USB-C to Be Presented Next Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-law-that-could-force-the-iphone-to-switch-to-usb-c-to-be-presented-next-month.2307435/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6qOlVQPsLmo:WdrFXENdGDI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6qOlVQPsLmo:WdrFXENdGDI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6qOlVQPsLmo\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82e04721cad8e08fad8afb330504bb97da4febc5da61e20bf77c2856346b3059","category":"Apple"}
