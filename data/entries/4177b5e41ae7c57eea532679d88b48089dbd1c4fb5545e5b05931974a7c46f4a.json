The 6061-T6 pulley and hanger body is machined in Portland, Oregon, and anodized locally.</p>\n<p>The pulley design will center itself after wheel replacement, but the option exists to immobilize the pulley with any 0.040 M5 washer – a pair of brass ones is free with purchase upon request; just put it in the order notes when ordering direct from Shovel Research.</p>\n<p>Sold as a pair. Comes with a 2.5mm hex key and hardened stainless set screws with thread locker pre-applied.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://shovelresearch.com/wrt-hanger\" target=\"_blank\">Shovel Research</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/shovel-research-wrt-cable-hanger/\">Shovel Research WRT Cable Hanger</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"4177b5e41ae7c57eea532679d88b48089dbd1c4fb5545e5b05931974a7c46f4a","category":"Cycling"}
