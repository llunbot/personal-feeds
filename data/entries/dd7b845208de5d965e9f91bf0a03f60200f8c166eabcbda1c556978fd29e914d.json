Meanwhile, Pro Edition users can remotely access a macOS Sonoma 14 VM via port forwarding, which is useful for VMs hosted on Amazon EC2 Mac cloud instances.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Parallels Desktop software has also been given a design overhaul, with a new app icon and a refreshed UI that aims to make navigation simpler, along with native dialogs for easier interaction with the app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Windows-touch-id-PD-19.jpg\" alt width=\"986\" height=\"664\" />\r<br />\nThere are several other improvements highlighted in the release notes for Parallels Desktop 19, including:\r<br />\n<ul><li>Improved OpenGL support, up to version 4.1, for running more CAD software on Mac, including VariCAD, Deswik.CAD, Vectorworks Vision 2023, and more.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Improved performance for AcrGIS Pro, a map designing application. </li>\r<br />\n<li>Compatible to run CentOS 9 Stream on Mac computers with Apple silicon, along with an updated set of ready-to-go Linux distributions, including Ubuntu 22.04.2, Fedora 38, Debian 12, and more. </li>\r<br />\n<li>New option to create Arm-based Linux VM on Mac computers with Apple silicon using Rosetta to run x86-64 binaries, including containers. </li>\r<br />\n<li>Enhanced support for the HashiCorpâ€™s Packer and Vagrant with macOS VM on Apple silicon. </li>\r<br />\n<li>New option to create, group, and manage Parallels VMs and their containers from the Visual Studio Code extension. </li>\r<br />\n<li>Support for enrolling Windows in Windows management solutions, such as Microsoft Intune and others, when deploying it using Parallels My Account Configuration Profile or as a shared file. </li></ul>Parallels Desktop 19 for Mac Standard, Pro, and Business editions can be purchased or upgraded to at <a href=\"https://prf.hn/l/oVwWOoA\">parallels.com/desktop</a> or from authorized resellers.
