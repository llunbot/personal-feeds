Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out\nafter the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the\niconic chipmaker, adding to turmoil at one of the pioneers of the\ntechnology industry.</p>\n\n<p>The clash came to a head last week when Gelsinger met with the\nboard about the company’s progress on winning back market share\nand narrowing the gap with Nvidia Corp., according to people\nfamiliar with the matter. He was given the option to retire or be\nremoved, and chose to announce the end of his career at Intel,\nsaid the people, who declined to be identified discussing\nproceedings that were not made public.</p>\n\n<p>Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston\nHolthaus are serving as interim co-CEOs while the board searches\nfor Gelsinger’s replacement, <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1719/intel-announces-retirement-of-ceo-pat-gelsinger\">the company said in a statement</a>.\nFrank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel, will serve\nas interim executive chair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/241202/p21#a241202p21\">Techmeme’s roundup</a>.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack\">The Big Hack</a>” in October 2018 — a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China’s intelligence services. The story presented no confirmable evidence <em>at all</em>, was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/\">vehemently denied</a> by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/\">all companies</a> involved, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/22/your-move-bloomberg/\">has not been confirmed by a single other publication</a> (despite much effort to do so), and has been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/09/big-hack-doubts\">largely discredited by one of Bloomberg’s own sources</a>. By all appearances “The Big Hack” was complete bullshit. Yet Bloomberg has issued no correction or retraction, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con\">their only ostensibly substantial follow-up</a> contained not one shred of evidence to back up their allegations. Bloomberg seemingly hopes we’ll all just forget about it. I say we do not just forget about it. Everything they publish should be treated with skepticism until they retract “The Big Hack” or provide evidence that <em>any of it</em> was true.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/02/intel-gelsinger-forced-out\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2b6c0fe864bfd9782fcd2caaf3b4c3701557c2349e55a316bcc3587a8eb08ffd","category":"Tech"}
