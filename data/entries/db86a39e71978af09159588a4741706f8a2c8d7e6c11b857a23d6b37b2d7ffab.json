{"title":"50 Shades of eMTB Maintenance with this Revolutionary EXO eBike Repair Stand?","link":"https://bikerumor.com/exo-collapsible-universal-e-bike-repair-stand-cage-bdsm-workstand/","date":1749226586000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_roll-it.webp\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"EXO collapsible Universal eBike Repair Stand cage, How-To\" /></p>\n<p>OK, please forgive me for the BDSM-inspired headline, but this wildly simple EXO Universal eBike Repair Stand seems almost too good to be true. Why buy an expensive and bulky motor-assisted bicycle repair stand to work on your heavy ebike, when you could have this much more affordable flat-pack aluminum cage to suspend your eMTB while you work on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strap your ride in, and roll it around your garage to get to the ebike from all angles. Then, when you’re done, pack it all down back into its bag, and tuck it out of the way until you need to hog-tie another ebike into submission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>EXO collapsible Universal E-Bike Repair Stand cage</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the continued boom of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bike-types/e-bike-2/\" target=\"_blank\">ebikes</a> from cheap factory-direct commuters to high-dollar premium <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=eMTB\" target=\"_blank\">eMTBs</a>, one thing is often overlooked – even the best are much heavier than conventional bikes. And that means a lot more struggling when you try to do any home maintenance. It doesn’t matter whether you are changing a tire, cleaning your drivetrain, or trying to overhaul your suspension. So quickly, a shout-out to friend of Bikerumor, Clayton Wangbichler for the tip on this <em><s>monstrosity</s></em> ingenuity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ebikes are heavy. Ebike-capable repair stands are expensive. Enter the EXO eBike Repair Stand as an alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This thing is simply a snap-together rectangular aluminum cage with strap anchor points in each of its 8 corners. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_animation.gif\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_animation.gif\" alt=\"EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Take all the parts out of the bag. And snap the straight aluminum legs into the 8 corner junctions to create the cage. All tool-free.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Roll your ebike (or even a regular bike) inside. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Loop the short blue straps around the fork crown/stem and seatpost. And attach them through the ring to the loops in the top corners of the cage with the blue ratchet straps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then, lash down each fork leg and each dropout/seatstay to the corners with the red-orange ratcheting strap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tighten those blue straps to lift it off the ground. And cinch everything tight.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then, simply roll the cage over, across your workshop floor (or driveway) to easily access whatever side you need to work on – all while the ebike stays securely suspended inside.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_wheel-removal.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_wheel-removal.webp\" alt=\"EXO collapsible Universal E-Bike Repair Stand cage, upside down maintenance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_wheel-removal.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_wheel-removal-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_wheel-removal-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-eBike-Repair-Stand-cage_wheel-removal-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it. The strap design looks like it should stay out of the way for common tasks like spinning the drivetrain or removing a wheel. Removing the fork, working on the headset, or making changes to the stem/handlebar setup would be more complicated. But the concept is so simple, a creative mind could probably figure out plenty of other ways to strap in your ebike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>EXO eBike Repair Stand cage – Pricing &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device.webp\" alt=\"EXO collapsible Universal E-Bike Repair Stand cage, 50 shades of ebike maintenance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_BDSM-inspired-ebike-suspension-torture-device-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>EXO calls their collapsible repair stand cage lightweight and easily stored. But they don’t say how much it actually weighs, how big the assembled cage is, or even its packed dimensions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_contents.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"666\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_contents.webp\" alt=\"EXO collapsible Universal eBike Repair Stand cage, contents\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_contents.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_contents-297x99.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_contents-1536x511.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_contents-120x40.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EXO-collapsible-Universal-E-Bike-Repair-Stand-cage_contents-768x256.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing is pretty affordable compared to almost any bike- or ebike-specific repair stands, but not exactly cheap at $249. That does include the cage with its heavy-duty anchor points, the snap-together aluminum legs, all the straps you need, and a bag to store it in. But, it does not include shipping costs (delivery only available in the USA). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did a quick check, and West Coast US buyers will pay at least $35 for shipping, but East Coasters will pay $80 or more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://exoebike.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>EXOebike.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/exo-collapsible-universal-e-bike-repair-stand-cage-bdsm-workstand/\">50 Shades of eMTB Maintenance with this Revolutionary EXO eBike Repair Stand?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"db86a39e71978af09159588a4741706f8a2c8d7e6c11b857a23d6b37b2d7ffab","category":"Cycling"}
