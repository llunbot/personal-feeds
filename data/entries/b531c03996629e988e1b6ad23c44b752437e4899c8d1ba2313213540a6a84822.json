{"title":"Apple Announces iPhone 16e With A18 Chip and Apple Intelligence, Pricing Starts at $599","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/","date":1739980943000,"content":"Apple today <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/\">introduced the iPhone 16e</a>, its newest entry-level smartphone. The device succeeds the third-generation iPhone SE, which has now been discontinued.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Apple-Newsroom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16e features a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, up from a 4.7-inch LCD on the iPhone SE. The display has a notch for Face ID, and this means that Apple no longer sells any iPhones with a Touch ID fingerprint button, marking the end of an era.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16e is powered by an A18 chip, enabling support for Apple Intelligence features, such as notification summaries and Genmoji for creating custom emoji.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device is also equipped with an Apple-designed 5G modem called the C1, whereas other iPhones have a Qualcomm modem. Apple says its own modem is so power efficient that the iPhone 16e offers the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone model ever.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the back of the iPhone 16e is a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera, which provides a 2x \"optical-quality\" Telephoto option, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther key features include an Action button instead of a Ring/Silent switch, along with a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. The device does not have the Camera Control button that was introduced across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will be accepting pre-orders for the iPhone 16e starting at 5 a.m. Pacific Time on Friday, February 21, and the device launches on Friday, February 28. In the U.S., pricing starts at $599. The device is available in white or black, and with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage capacities.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">Apple Announces iPhone 16e With A18 Chip and Apple Intelligence, Pricing Starts at $599</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-iphone-16e-with-a18-chip-and-apple-intelligence-pricing-starts-at-599.2449702/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b531c03996629e988e1b6ad23c44b752437e4899c8d1ba2313213540a6a84822","category":"Apple"}
