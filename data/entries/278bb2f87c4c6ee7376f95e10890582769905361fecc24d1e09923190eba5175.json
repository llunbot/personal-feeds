Apple Intelligence allows you to rewrite or proofread text automatically across Mail, Notes, Safari, Pages, Keynote, and third-party apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence is grounded in a user's personal information, allowing it to access data from your apps and what's on your screen. At the same time, thanks to on-device processing, Apple Intelligence is aware of your personal data without collecting your data. And when it needs more compute capacity, it sends only the data needed to fulfill the request to Apple servers based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, which share the same privacy and security capabilities of your ‌iPhone‌. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the heart of Apple Intelligence is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, which is now more natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal. The virtual assistant allows you to make corrections in real-time and maintains conversational context. ‌Siri‌ will also eventually have on-screen awareness, so if you ask it to do something related to what's going on in an app, it will know what you are talking about, without needing more information. Apple says ‌Siri‌ will be able to understand and take actions in more apps over time, and it includes a semantic index of photos, calendar events, and files.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Siri‌ will also help you with your writing. A new feature called Rewrite allows you to change the tone or proofread inline text in Mail and other apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence will automatically summarize notifications, too. A new Focus mode called \"Reduce Interruptions\" can automatically look at notifications and messages to see if they're important enough to interrupt you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> requires <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, while on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a>, Macs and iPads powered by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon or later are required. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wwdc-2024/\">WWDC 2024</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/\">'Apple Intelligence' Generative Personal AI Unveiled for iPhone, iPad, and Mac</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac.2428655/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"278bb2f87c4c6ee7376f95e10890582769905361fecc24d1e09923190eba5175","category":"Apple"}
