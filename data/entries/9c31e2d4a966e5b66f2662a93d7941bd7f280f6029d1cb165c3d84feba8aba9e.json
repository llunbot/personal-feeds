They’re designed with a budget in mind without sacrificing modern geometry or tire clearance. Unlike other brand’s offerings, you can design and customize each of Sonder’s builds, upgrading handlebars, dropper posts, and forks.</p>\n<p>The Broken Road is a 100 mm travel hardtail, designed with long tours in mind. It’s made from high-quality 4130 chromoly steel tubing with gussets at the headtube and bottom bracket to add stiffness where its needed without adding excess weight. Because it’s 100 mm travel, it will take a number of rigid carbon forks on the market without adversely affecting the geometry.</p>\n<p>It is optimized for use with 29″ tires with a long wheelbase and relaxed head angle strike the perfect balance between comfortable uphill grinding and hair-raising downhill whooping and make for efficient all-day riding over rough terrain.</p>\n<p>Instead of carrying floppy bikepacking-style bags, the Broken Road comes with rack mounts.</p>\n<p>See more build kits and pricing options at <a href=\"https://alpkit.com/collections/sonder-broken-road\" target=\"_blank\">Alpkit</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sonder-broken-road-steel-hardtail/\">Sonder Broken Road Hardtail Now in Steel and Under $2000</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9c31e2d4a966e5b66f2662a93d7941bd7f280f6029d1cb165c3d84feba8aba9e","category":"Cycling"}
