Learning new skills <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMcibr1100496\">correlates with changes in the brain</a>, as evidenced by neuroscience <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/cognitive-flexibility-is-essential-to-navigating-a-changing-world-new-research-in-mice-shows-how-your-brain-learns-new-rules-204259\">research with animals</a> and functional brain scans in people. Presumably, if you master Calculus 1, something is now different in your brain. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00515.2006\">motor neurons in the brain expand and contract</a> depending on how often they are exercised— a neuronal reflection of “use it or lose it.”</p>\n<p>People may wish their brains could change faster—not just when learning new skills, but also when overcoming problems like anxiety, depression, and addictions.</p>\n<p>Clinicians and scientists know there are times the brain can make rapid, enduring changes. Most often, these <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0079-6123(07)67012-5\">occur in the context of traumatic experiences</a>, leaving an indelible imprint on the brain.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972629#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972629&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0f001c54aafacc6a47c9222c9144428741f45ab6f3940b6bd63e86a9627c920f","category":"Tech"}
