But guess what? It might not be as tightly locked down as you think. While Apple keeps adding and improving iOS security features, some sneaky ways thieves and hackers can get in still exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at some common security threats iPhone users face and how you can protect yourself. From sneaky shoulder surfers to tricky phishing attacks, it’s time to uncover the hidden risks lurking in your pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An update is waiting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We all receive notifications about software updates, but they’re easy to ignore, especially if there aren’t any new features to try. But delaying them can leave our iPhones vulnerable to serious threats. Every update contains numerous security patches that can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672485/do-iphones-get-viruses.html\">shut down serious threats</a>. For example, the iOS 14.7.1 update in 2021 targeted the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/351455/macalope-iphone-pegasus-spyware-threat-android-security.html\">Pegasus spyware</a>, which was used at a high level to access messages, activate the camera and microphone, and collect location data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To steer clear of threats, install software updates promptly. Keeping iOS up to date on your iPhone is one of the simplest ways to safeguard your device.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 16.5.1 update showing on iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios-16.5.1-update-iphone.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>iOS updates include security updates that patch vulnerabilities that could expose your iPhone to hackers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Your PIN is showing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it’s safe to unlock your iPhone with a PIN in public but think again. In recent years, thieves have used a sneaky technique called “shoulder surfing” to watch people enter their passcodes and then snatch their iPhones to get full access to their device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple knows these threats are real, so they’ve added some features to iOS to help keep your iPhone safe. First up, they <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2211437/ios-17-3-upgrade-security-iphone-stolen-device-protection.html\">added Stolen Device Protection</a> in iOS 17.3. This feature makes it a bit harder for someone to steal your iPhone or break into it. When you try to change an Apple Account password or Face ID settings, it’ll delay you. And it’ll also stop certain actions without Face ID or Touch ID authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, people can also steal your iPhone and try to guess your PIN. Apple has a stop for that too. In iOS 18.1, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2518717/apple-quietly-added-inactivity-reboot-in-ios-18-1-to-safeguard-a-lost-or-stolen-iphone.html\">added an inactivity reboot</a> feature that will automatically reboot and put it into the “Before First Unlock” state, making it harder for someone trying to guess your PIN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But above all, choose a complex PIN and be extra careful when entering it in public. Use Face ID or Touch ID whenever possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A malicious profile is hiding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever clicked on a link that asked you to install a new configuration profile? These profiles can be useful for things like joining a work network or installing a VPN, but cybercriminals can use them to take over your device. They trick you into installing these profiles through phishing emails or fake websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once these profiles are installed, hackers can change your device settings, spy on you, and install unwanted apps without your knowledge. This is a sneaky way for them to gain control of your iPhone—and you might not even know it’s there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this, only install configuration profiles from trusted sources. If you’re asked to install one unexpectedly, say no and check the source. Also, regularly check your installed profiles under Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN &amp; Device Management and remove any that look suspicious.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 17 stolen device protection\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2336w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ios17-stolen-device.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Stolen Device Protection will make it more difficult for thieves to get into the most sensitive parts of your iPhone.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>You clicked the wrong link</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Phishing attacks are getting smarter, targeting iPhone users with emails and messages that look like they’re from Apple. These sneaky messages often trick you into giving away your Apple ID username and password by tricking you into thinking there’s an urgent issue with your account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once hackers have your information, they can access all your iCloud content, such as your photos, contacts, and backups. They might even lock you out of your own account or use your details to launch more scams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, be careful of emails or messages that say they’re from Apple, even if they seem legit. Apple will rarely if ever send you a message like that, so check the sender’s address carefully, and never click on links you don’t trust. Instead, go straight to your iPhone Settings or contact support to check for anything wrong with your account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Your SIM was swapped</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your iPhone uses a physical SIM card, you’re at risk of SIM swapping attacks. This is when someone tricks your mobile carrier into transferring your phone number to a new SIM card they control. Once they have your number, they can intercept calls and text messages, including two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and basically clone your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With access to your 2FA codes, hackers can breach your accounts, reset passwords, and bypass security measures. This deceptive tactic can have serious consequences for your personal and financial information. And even newer iPhones with eSIMs <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sim-swappers-hijacking-phone-numbers-in-esim-attacks/\">are at risk</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent this from happening to you, contact your mobile carrier and set up a PIN or password that must be provided before any changes are made to your account. And as always, use app-based authentication methods, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/917751/how-to-use-passkeys.html\">passkeys</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233818/two-factor-authentication-sms-email-authenticator-app-hardware-key-accounts.html\">2FA</a> whenever possible.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 Pro SIM tray\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4572w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-SIM-tray.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Hackers don’t need physical access to your device to hijack your SIM.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>You’re tempted to jailbreak</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jailbreaking your iPhone might seem like a fun way to make it your own, but it’s actually a considerable risk. It removes many built-in security features that protect you from harmful software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without those safeguards, your iPhone can get infected with malware, have your data stolen, or even be hacked. What’s more, jailbroken devices often miss out on important security updates, so they’re even more vulnerable to these threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, before you jailbreak your iPhone, think about it. The cool stuff you can do with it won’t make up for the security risks. Stick with the official version of iOS, and you’ll be safe and sound. And besides, with so many customization options in the latest versions, you probably <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2409375/iphone-customize-ios-home-screen-lock-screen-buttons-shortcuts.html\">don’t even need to anymore</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6c0bbe00372ae6e4b435886b878a4f9654b334cd03384e742d641958144b13af","category":"Apple"}
