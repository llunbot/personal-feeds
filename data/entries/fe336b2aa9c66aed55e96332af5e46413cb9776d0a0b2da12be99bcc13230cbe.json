There is no workaround available, and since there is no easy way to revert a macOS update, affected users might be unable to return to a stable configuration unless they have a complete backup of their systems prior to the OS update.</blockquote>The blog post and <a href=\"https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=8327860\">bug report</a> include more technical details about the issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOracle says it has notified Apple about the issue.
