It hasn’t been sunshine and rainbows for everyone, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s our breakdown of the peloton’s winners and losers from the past month.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Winners</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Matthew Brennan</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2206206365-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Josep Lago/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Theres no doubt about it – this was Matthew Brennan’s month. He started it by winning Le Tour des 100 Communes and GP Lillers for the Visma-Lease a Bike development team, then claimed his first professional victory in his first race with the senior team at GP de Denain. He then went to the Volta a Catalunya and surprised everyone with an incredible comeback on the uphill finish on Stage 1 for his first WorldTour win and a fourth win in four races in March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He came close to making it five on Stage 2 but ultimately placed second behind Israel-Premier Tech’s Ethan Vernon. That wasn’t the end of the story, however: he won again on Stage 5, before Visma pulled him out of the race ahead of the final stage to rest up for a revised schedule that reflects his impressive form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brennan has made a huge impression in his first short time on the WorldTour so far having spent the last season in their development team, and the 19-year-old Brit will certainly have a lot of eyes on him in the next races he does.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fredrik Dversnes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205089153-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Brennan isn’t the only rider to notch his first WorldTour win this month. Fredrik Dversnes made the day’s breakaway on Stage 5 of Tirreno-Adriatico and on the final climb of the day launched an attack from the leading group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a speeding peloton behind including the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-profile\">Tom Pidcock</a>, Mathieu van der Poel and Filippo Ganna, Dversnes would cling on after over 200km in the front, finishing just a couple of seconds ahead of the pack. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

Remo was quite the spectacle. It was an historic moment for the women’s peloton with the return of the race after a two-decade absence and UAE Team ADQ’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-longo-borghini-cyclist\">Elisa Longo Borghini</a> launched a bid for glory in the final 2km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotte Kopecky had other ideas though and chased her down to deliver teammate Lorena Wiebes for a sprinting masterclass for victory ahead of Marianne Vos. Wiebes then went on to win Brugge-De Panne and promptly take her 100th pro victory at Gent-Wevelgem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noemi Rüegg completed the podium, and she could’ve easily made it onto our list of winners too. It’s been quite the year for the Swiss rider so far, following up her win at the Tour Down Under with ninth at Strade Bianche, sixth at Trofeo Alfredo Binda and that third place in San Remo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205754978-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dirk Waem/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the men’s race, however hard he tried <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\">Tadej Pogačar</a> could not shake off Mathieu van der Poel, the Dutchman sticking to his wheel like glue from the Cipressa all the way to the Via Roma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filippo Ganna crawled his way back to make it a three-man sprint but Van der Poel had too much and won his second Milan-San Remo title.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lennard Kämna</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1666\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-300x195.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-970x631.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-768x500.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-1536x1000.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-2048x1333.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-750x488.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2207503813-1140x742.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Szymon Gruchalski/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a long road back to recovery for Lennard Kämna.

mixed fortunes for Visma-Lease a Bike with the highs of Matthew Brennan, Matteo Jorgenson and Ben Tulett’s wins combined with the lows of being off the mark in the Classics and losing two key riders to injury. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Jonas Vingegaard’s crash at Paris-Nice, he got back on his bike to cross the line with a sore-looking wrist. His teammate Victor Campenaerts would tell Sporza that ‘given the circumstances, it’s very impressive that he finished this stage. I didn’t get the impression that he was very lucid.’ Vingegaard also mentioned that he was ‘dizzy’ after the crash and was incredibly nauseous, later abandoning the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite passing an initial check during the race, it was later confirmed he suffered a concussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another blow, Visma sprinter Olav Kooij crashed out at Gent-Wevelgem this weekend. Despite initially managing to stick with Mads Pedersen’s attack, a few metres later he ended his race sitting on the grass and holding his left arm. Visma confirmed later on that he had fractured his collarbone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yellow card recipients </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/pauline-ferrand-prevot-2025-visma-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What do Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, Jonathan Milan and Kaden Groves have in common?

Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Groves has received two yellows (three in a 30-day period is a two-week suspension) in March, one at the Volta a Catalunya and the other at Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne for slowing down during a sprint – celebrating his teammate’s victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EF Education-Oatly’s Cédrine Kerbaol also earned a yellow card at Milan-San Remo for ‘pushing off against car, motorcycle or rider’, and Picnic-PostNL’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pfeiffer-georgi-profile\">Pfeiffer Georgi</a> got one for a sprint deviation at Trofeo Alfredo Binda.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UAE Team Emirates’s clothing sponsor</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2205286923-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tommaso Berardi/NurPhoto via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaac del Toro won big at Milano-Torino only to be immediately hit with a fine for ‘damaging the image of the sport’.
