These traits sound appealing—what hiring manager wouldn’t want a driven employee?</p>\n<p>But there’s a catch. In my latest study, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05254\">published in the journal Management Science</a> with co-authors <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/directory/jackson_scott.php\">Scott Jackson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/nick-seybert\">Nick Seybert</a>, I found that these terms may attract job applicants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2005.03.002\">with more narcissistic tendencies</a>.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://olemiss.edu/profiles/jlgay\">behavioral researchers</a> in accounting, we are interested in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679X.12176\">executives who bend the rules</a>.

Prior research also shows that narcissistic employees are more innovative and willing to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-017-9427-x\">take risks to get the success</a> and admiration they crave, even if it means bending the rules.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-the-language-of-job-postings-can-attract-rule-bending-narcissists/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-the-language-of-job-postings-can-attract-rule-bending-narcissists/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan Gay, The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5479c0453d469d22f9d0f301858c0a1b796e7c4e405dd6843897ee6ad5ea7d5b","category":"Tech"}
