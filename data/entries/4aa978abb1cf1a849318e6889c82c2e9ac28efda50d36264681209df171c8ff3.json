And things did not slow down in 2024. As a result, we entered a stretch where every month set a new record as the warmest iteration of that month that we've ever recorded. Last month, that pattern <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/climate-wise-it-was-a-full-year-of-exceptional-months/\">stretched out for a full 12 months</a>, as June of 2024 once again became the warmest June ever recorded. But, despite some exceptional temperatures in July, it fell just short of last July's monthly temperature record, bringing the streak to a close.</p>\n<p>Europe's Copernicus system was <a href=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu/july-was-second-warmest-record-ending-record-breaking-13-month-streak\">first to announce</a> that July of 2024 was ever so slightly cooler than July of 2023, missing out on setting a new record by just 0.04° C. So far, none of the other major climate trackers, such as Berkeley Earth or NASA GISS, have come out with data for July. These each have slightly different approaches to tracking temperatures, and, with a margin that small, it's possible we'll see one of them register last month as warmer or statistically indistinguishable.</p>\n<p>How exceptional are the temperatures of the last few years? The EU averaged every July from 1991 to 2020—a period well after climate change had warmed the planet significantly—and July of 2024 was still 0.68° C above that average.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041893#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041893&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4aa978abb1cf1a849318e6889c82c2e9ac28efda50d36264681209df171c8ff3","category":"Tech"}
