We’ve seen them integrated with tech like Specialized’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=angi+helmet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ANGi</a> for years, and the separate but bulky <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=icedot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IceDot</a> has been a helmet solution concept for almost a decade now. But the technology for crash detection, GPS location, and communication to an emergency contact has remained either big or expensive (sometimes both.)</p><p>Now, Cratoni’s new standalone C-Safe crash sensor hopes to make connected incident detection cheaper and more user-friendly. The simple gadget is only a bit over 2cm square and can attach directly to your helmet’s straps.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade.jpg\" alt=\"Cratoni C-Safe crash sensor, add-on impact detection safety upgrade for any helmet,&nbsp;what's in teh box?\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15035116/Cratoni-C-Safe-crash-sensor_strap-on_stick-on_affordable-impact-incident-detection-upgrade-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Clip it onto your XC helmet for crash detection while riding trails, then clip it to your enduro helmet straps to protect you riding in the bikepark.
