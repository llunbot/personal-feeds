It succeeds in mixing the best of the tablet and laptop experience, being a tablet PC that runs Windows 11, uses a backlit detachable keyboard cover, and is optimized for use with a digital pen (the Surface Pen). It's lightweight and has a smaller footprint than most 2-in-1 laptops while packing enough power to edit media and handle light gaming at higher configurations.</p>\n<p>The entry-level Surface Pro 9 (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) is currently on sale for $900 at Best Buy, down from $1,000, and it comes with a free Surface Keyboard cover, which typically runs you an extra $180. That's $300 less than the entry point for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kJDFuc\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a>, which can't run full programs (only apps) and doesn't include its separately sold Magic Keyboard, which costs $350. This 13-inch Surface Pro model has an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB storage, which is great for those who simply want a device to edit documents and surf the web without sacrificing the ability to use full programs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922048#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922048&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b4197555a1427c109c89a56310c611a642681e16b3ac80410a4322033939dac","category":"Tech"}
