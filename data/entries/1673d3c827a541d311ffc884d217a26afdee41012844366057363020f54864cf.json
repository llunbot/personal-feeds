The program and app continue to develop and add new features. Perhaps the writing was on the wall earlier this year when Zwift <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/02/resigns-series-discontinued.html\" target=\"_blank\">laid off more than 100 employees</a>, but now Zwift has announced a price increase as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, a month of Zwift subscription would run $14.99 here in the United States. That price has now increased to $19.99 per month, a 33% increase. The price of an annual subscription has also increased, from $149.99 to $199.99. You’re still getting essentially two months free with the annual subscription, though both options have gone up in price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that price is it still worth it? If you spend a lot of time on Zwift, it likely is. Especially when you consider all the upcoming improvements that will be rolling out later this year. Check out the details straight from Zwift below:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WATOPIA EXPANSION: THE GRADE</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift New Features 2024 Tour de France price increase1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase2.jpg 1920w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Zwift)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Launching June 2024</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolling out to Zwifters in June, The Grade is designed to be a testing climb for Zwifters. Built on the West side of Zwift’s most recent expansion, Watopia’s Southern Coast, The Grade will start among the vibrant buildings of Ciudad de La Cumbre, and connect Watopia’s Southern Coast with the backside of the Epic KOM. The Grade creates a direct, very steep passage from Ciudad de La Cumbre to the top of Epic KOM. The expansion will launch with several new routes available for freeride exploration, training, and racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MY LIST</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase3.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"858\" height=\"482\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase3.gif\" alt=\"Zwift New Features 2024 Tour de France price increase1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Launching April 2024</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already psyching yourself up to take on the challenge of The Grade?

These will then be shown in For You on the Zwift Home Screen the next time they log in. Never waste a minute with My List!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HUD REFRESH</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift New Features 2024 Tour de France price increase1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase4.jpg 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Launching Summer 2024</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift’s in-game HUD is about to get a fresh new look and provide you with more information right where you need it. One of the standout features of the updated HUD is a new ‘Climb Mode’ dynamic elevation profile display. The new display will help Zwifters better pace their climbing efforts and prepare for the road ahead by utilising the same gradient shading found in the Climb Portal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HUD update will also allow Zwifters to customise the data fields shown in the power tile of the HUD via the in-game settings menu. At launch, Zwifters will be able to choose from Speed, Average Power, Power-to-Weight Ratio (W/KG), Cadence and Heart Rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this update, the mini-map will also receive a refresh. The updated mini-map will provide greater clarity on route progression, including elevation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>TRAINING CONNECTIONS</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift New Features 2024 Tour de France price increase1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase5.jpg 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Launching Early Summer 2024</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ways to train on Zwift – whether using a flexible training plan, joining a Group Workout, choosing from the 1000+ on-demand workouts, or building your own via the Custom Workout builder. For those with very specific plans in mind – whether from a coach, or another third-party training provider – Zwift’s new training API Connection will give Zwifters greater flexibility with how they want to train on the platform by providing better integration with other platforms and coaching services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Functionally, this new API will behave much like existing third-party connections on Zwift. Once the API Connection is set up and approved, workouts built outside of Zwift will pull directly into the Zwift platform and show in the Custom Workouts folder. The training API will launch later this spring with a few launch partners. Other providers will be able to sign up for this open-API later in the summer. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CELEBRATING THE TOUR DE FRANCE ON ZWIFT</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift New Features 2024 Tour de France price increase1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zwift-New-Features-2024-Tour-de-France-price-increase6.jpg 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift, the Official Training Software Provider to the Tour de France is getting ready for Tour Fever to hit this July with a month of Tour-themed content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in time for the Tour de France last year, Zwift’s Climb portal is ready for a busy month with eight of the most iconic climbs from this 2024 route scheduled to bring cycling fans closer to the action.
