Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h2>What is new with SRAM’s T-Type Eagle Transmission?</h2>\n\n<p>In short, all of SRAM’s T-Type Eagle Transmission components are brand new, from the derailleur to the AXS Pod Controllers.</p>\n<p>Although no one component is more important than another, some – such as the chain and derailleur – have had bigger, more visible changes compared to the pedal cranks and chainrings, for example.</p>\n<h2>SRAM T-Type Eagle Transmission derailleur – goodbye, derailleur hangers</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The two generations of derailleur have starkly different designs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Receiving the most striking redesign is the rear derailleur, available in XX SL, XX and X0 versions.</p>\n<p>Removing the need for a derailleur hanger means it mounts directly to the bike’s frame at the rear wheel axle, using SRAM’s Hangerless Interface.</p>\n<p>The rear wheel axle is used as the derailleur’s mounting point.</p>\n<p>The axle is the centre point of the cassette, therefore the derailleur’s upper jockey wheel is in the same relative position to the cassette no matter which gear is selected, or how tight or slack the chain is.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The derailleur clamps the bike’s frame from both sides.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Derailleurs mounted via a hanger are offset in relation to the cassette; their mounting point is below the cassette’s centre. T-Type addresses this with its Full Mount design.</p>\n<p>Frames with SRAM’s UDH have the Hangerless Interface, required to fit T-Type’s new design.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> B-tension and limit-screw adjustment are needed because of the variability of derailleur hanger designs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Hangerless Interface replaces the UDH.</p>\n<p>The derailleur attaches to the bike’s bare dropout, with its machined aluminium Full Mount struts clamping the frame from either side of the Hangerless Interface.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Hangerless Interface is left when the UDH is removed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>An axle with a bushing passes through the dropout, enabling the derailleur to pivot if required.</p>\n<h3>No adjustment required</h3>\n<p>Key to removing the derailleur’s limit and b-tension adjustment screws is its Full Mount design.</p>\n<p>This eliminates variations in distance between the derailleur and cassette, and therefore the need for limit screws.</p>\n<p>Micro adjustments – where the derailleur’s position can be trimmed using the AXS smartphone app or the AXS Pod Controller – are still present, and may need to be used to fine-tune its position on the cassette.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Setup Key can be flipped between the A and B positions to accommodate different frame designs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Initial or re-installation setup is required, but, in our experience, the T-Type Eagle Transmission setup process is easier than the current-generation <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/sram-eagle/\">Eagle drivetrains</a>.</p>\n<p>The derailleur’s Cage Mode button – called the Cage Lock button on previous models – is used to hold the cage in a forward position for wheel removal. It has a secondary position called the Setup Key that’s used during installation.</p>\n<p>Putting the derailleur in the Setup Key position and engaging the dedicated setup cassette sprocket (gear seven) makes setting the correct chain gap between the derailleur cage and cassette possible without needing to adjust the b-tension for a given bike’s suspension sag.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Setup is different on T-Type, but it’s much simpler. The Setup Key has two positions; your bike’s design dictates which position is required.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This eliminates the need for the b-tension adjustment.</p>\n<p>The Setup Key also accommodates different or changing chain lengths, as required by varying suspension designs and chainstay figures.</p>\n<p>SRAM has produced a chain length chart that uses chainstay length (from 425mm to 470mm) and chainring size (30t to 42t) to define the ideal number of chain links for any given bike.</p>\n<p>The derailleur’s design and setup procedures negate the need for derailleur adjustability.</p>\n<h3>Modularity and replaceable parts</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These parts of the derailleur can be dismantled and replaced easily.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>According to SRAM, the derailleur’s design also “delivers unprecedented robustness”.</p>\n<p>Derailleur modularity means sections of it are replaceable.</p>\n<p>A user-replaceable Skid Plate on the derailleur’s widest portion is attached using 2mm Allen bolts.</p>\n<p>The parallelogram’s lower and upper links are also replaceable and are held in place with 2mm and 2.5mm Allen bolts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The clutch mechanism is attached to the cage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Both pulley wheels can also be replaced using Torx 25 bolts.</p>\n<p>Its cage can be removed and replaced requiring no tools, simply unscrewing from the derailleur’s p-knuckle.</p>\n<p>Although the clutch or damper mechanism’s tension remains un-adjustable (Shimano still holds the patent for adjustable-tension derailleur clutches), it’s now integrated into the removable cage.</p>\n<p>Increased T-Type derailleur clutch tension addresses one of the Eagle drivetrain’s main criticisms. However, according to SRAM, battery life is reduced marginally because it requires more motor force to change gear.</p>\n<p>T-Type is compatible with SRAM’s current AXS batteries, used on Eagle drivetrains, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/seatpost-and-seat-pin/rockshox-reverb-axs-wireless-dropper-post-review/\">Reverb AXS dropper posts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-flight-attendant/\">Flight Attendant</a> components.</p>\n<p>SRAM claims making T-Type derailleurs replaceable and rebuildable increases their lifespan.</p>\n<h3>Performance enhancements</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Magic Wheel’s outer toothed portion can continue to rotate if the inner spoked section is blocked.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A host of important derailleur redesigns have been made to further improve performance.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, derailleurs are positioned so the b-knuckle cants or angles it towards the chainring.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s new T-Type derailleur’s b-knuckle is straight.</p>\n<p>Instead, the cage is now angled so the bottom pulley is in line with the chainring, while the top one lines up with the cassette’s entire range of sprockets.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Not only is the derailleur cage canted, it’s also kinked so the upper and lower jockey wheels line up with the cassette and chainring respectively.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The cage has a ‘yaw angle’ or ‘kink’ across its length to do this, with it appearing ‘bent’ from the rear.</p>\n<p>It’s dubbed ‘Inline Cage’ because it’s always in line with the chainring and cassette.</p>\n<p>Next up is the Magic Wheel, which refers to the derailleur’s lower jockey wheel.</p>\n<p>The Magic Wheel is only available on XX SL and XX derailleur models. It can be purchased as a separate upgrade on X0 derailleurs.</p>\n<p>The toothed outer portion of the wheel can rotate independently from the spoked centre section. If blocked, the outer portion of the pulley continues to rotate on the stationary centre’s spokes, reducing the chances of chain jam and damage.</p>\n<p>To reduce object ingestion, the cage surrounding the front of the lower jockey wheel has a special shape. The pulley wheel teeth are designed to expel objects as the wheel rotates.</p>\n<h3>AXS damage defence features</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The upper black portion of the cage acts as a stopper to prevent it entering the spokes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like the current-generation <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-xx1-eagle-axs-review/\">Eagle AXS</a> drivetrains, the new T-Type derailleur features SRAM’s overload clutch.</p>\n<p>The derailleur’s motor and gearbox disengage during hard impacts, enabling the derailleur to move out of harm’s way. Post-impact, the motor re-engages, returning the derailleur to its original position.</p>\n<p>For this iteration, SRAM has implemented new protective measures.</p>\n<p>Despite the absence of limit screws, the derailleur still can’t enter the wheel’s spokes.</p>\n<p>The cage has a stopper plate, contacting the cassette’s largest sprocket before it goes into the spokes.</p>\n<p>An additional stopper prevents it from going outboard too far.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The T-Type rear derailleur has a small bushing insert for the bike frame’s Hangerless Interface. This enables the derailleur to rotate on its mount point in an impact.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To protect from large frontal impacts, the derailleur can rotate rearwards on its Full Mount.</p>\n<p>SRAM tested the derailleur’s durability, where it survived impacts of up to 60 joules, and withstood 6,000Nm of force before its plastic components began to deform.</p>\n<p>According to SRAM, the new derailleur is 10mm further inboard than Eagle AXS drivetrain derailleurs, further reducing the chances of impact damage.</p>\n<p>Many hours of laboratory and real-world testing have given SRAM the confidence to claim the derailleur has “unprecedented strength”.</p>\n<h2>SRAM T-Type Eagle Transmission AXS Pod Controller</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The AXS Pod Controllers have an all-new design that doesn’t mimic cable-operated shifters, like the AXS Controllers from Eagle drivetrains.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>T-Type has redesigned shifters, now called AXS Pod Controllers.</p>\n<p>The Pod Controllers eschew the previous-generation AXS controller’s analogue shifter copycat design, now with an identity of their own.</p>\n<p>Instead of the Rocker Paddle or original AXS controller buttons, Pod Controllers have two forward-facing buttons that sit above one another.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The modular design of the AXS Pod Controller means the electronic and mechanical sections can be split.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Pod’s button functions can be assigned in the SRAM AXS smartphone app to perform tasks such as shifting up or down the cassette or operating a RockShox Reverb AXS seatpost.</p>\n<p>Thanks to their flippable design, they can be fitted on the left-hand or right-hand side of the bar.</p>\n<p>Two versions are available (Ultimate and standard), with the Ultimate model getting interchangeable concave or convex buttons.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Its buttons can be removed for replacement.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Pod controllers can be broken down into their constituent parts, where the electronics and ergonomic portion can be split.</p>\n<p>Although SRAM didn’t say for sure, Pods could be customised with more or different control options to come.</p>\n<p>User repairability could also be possible; if the electronic portion of the Pod breaks, a replacement could be installed easily.</p>\n<p>There are two mounting options for the Pods.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Bridge Clamp and Infinity Loop provide two ways to mount the Pod Controller.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>First is the all-new Infinity Clamp. Sharing its looks with an infinity loop (hence the name), the Pod’s mounting interface is the same diameter as the handlebar, so the clamp can be run with either end on the bar or the Pod.</p>\n<p>The Infinity Clamp uses a single Torx 25 bolt to clamp the bars and Pod, but doesn’t ‘open’, so needs sliding onto the handlebars.</p>\n<p>The clamping band is thin, so positioning it to fit with brake levers, ebike remotes and personal preferences should be easier.</p>\n<p>Second is the Bridge Clamp. This replaces SRAM’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/sram-matchmaker-x/\">Matchmaker X</a> direct-mount system, but functions similarly.</p>\n<p>Instead of two horizontal mounting positions, the Bridge Clamp has 16mm of sliding adjustability, and the Pod can be angled on the clamp.</p>\n<p>Fore and aft adjustment remains the same as SRAM’s Matchmaker X, however.</p>\n<h2>SRAM T-Type Eagle Transmission cassette, chain and chainring</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Polished sections help reduce the chances of the cassette showing wear from shifting.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roo Fowler / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Eagle Transmission <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassettes</a> have been redesigned, their teeth now using SRAM’s alternating narrow–wide teeth thickness X-Sync design.</p>\n<p>The chain fits on the cassette in a specific way, and if it is placed incorrectly, after one full revolution it ‘resets’ to the correct position.</p>\n<p>Combined with X-Sync teeth, the cassette has specific shift lanes that permit or block the chain from moving to the next gear.</p>\n<p>Specific shift ramps, according to SRAM, mean the chain is always in permanent contact with the cassette as it shifts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The XX SL chain has hollow pins and links.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roo Fowler / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Shift ramps and X-Sync teeth are combined with firmware-based derailleur Cassette Mapping.</p>\n<p>The timing created by the cassette’s X-Sync tooth pattern means the derailleur’s shift sequence aligns with the shift ramps; it only shifts to the next gear when it is permitted to do so by the cassette and when the firmware knows a ramp is ‘available’.</p>\n<p>With the bike in a stand, this is evident: press the shift button repeatedly while turning the cranks slowly and there is a delay between the button press and the derailleur’s shift.</p>\n<p>This has all been done to improve on-power shifting, with SRAM claiming it “shift[s] perfectly under load”, even withstanding a “1,000-watt surge of power on your eMTB in a full sprint”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The X01 cassette is similar to XX, but without the high-polished sections.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roo Fowler / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>The cassette’s 55mm chain line is said to improve wear life and create less extreme chain angles between the cassette and chainring.
