And if you’re running tubeless, one of the best tools to get you back rolling is a tubeless plugger tool. Time is often of the essence in these repairs, so it helps to have a plugger loaded and ready to go at a moment’s notice. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Robert Axle plug inserted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Fox-38-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-GIF.gif\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-GIF.gif\" alt=\"Robert Axle plug in fork\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To that effect, Robert Axle Project (RAP)  is taking advantage of the unused space inside their axles to store their new tubeless tire plug tool. The stealthy device fits all 15mm RAP axles, but also fits Chris King thru axles. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-5.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-5.webp\" alt=\"Robert Axle plug loaded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-5.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-5-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-5-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-5-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-1.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-1.webp\" alt=\"Robert Axle plug\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-1.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-1-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-1-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Axle-Plug_Studio-1-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Weighing just 8g with a bacon strip included, the plugger is super light and can be stored in the axle with a plug preloaded and ready to go. You can also load more than one plug to prepare for larger punctures. The tool sells for $34 and includes 5 bacon plug strips. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Machined from 6061 Aluminum</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fits all 15mm RAP and Chris King thru axles (M15 and M14)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made in Oregon</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comes with 5 bacon strips</li>\n\n\n\n<li>8g with a bacon strip included</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://robertaxleproject.com\" target=\"_blank\">robertaxleproject.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/robert-axle-project-axle-plug-tubeless-plugger-tool/\">Robert Axle Project Introduces the Axle Plug: An 8g Tubeless Plugger Tool for RAP &amp; Chris King Axles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7239f97fa9b0ca047cff0291c1883ce8e8a86b9e5e670b93e1169c756a229943","category":"Cycling"}
