According to Velocio, the Luxe Collection is designed to elevate the experience of riding from dawn to dusk. The collection looks great and promises to bring a new level of performance to Merino wool jerseys, which have up to now been standard fare for brevet riders and road cycling’s purists. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Luxe Merino and Luxe Merino Color Block Jerseys</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LuxeWomenJersey.webp\" alt=\"Two women climb under sunny skies, wearing Velocio Luxe apparel. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LuxeWomenJersey.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LuxeWomenJersey-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LuxeWomenJersey-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LuxeWomenJersey-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LuxeWomenJersey-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LuxeWomenJersey-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Merino Luxe has a more svelte and athletic silhouette than traditional wool jerseys. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Made of 71% Wool, 18% Polyamide, and 11% Elastane, the Merino Luxe jersey breaks away from more traditional wool jerseys with a fit that balances a generous amount of stretch with an athletic and aero silhouette. The sleeves are extended to cover the entire arm above the elbow, and the collar is cut into a V to avoid excess material flapping around the shoulders. A zippered pocket on the outboard edge of the right rear pocket allows riders to store valuables and other essentials securely. In the past, one of the complaints about some Velocio jerseys was a tendency for loaded pockets to shift, pulling the jersey from side-to-side. With the rise of cargo bibs and frame storage, this is now less of an issue, but Velocio nonetheless has addressed this by adding reinforcements to keep the pocket contents better supported over bumpy terrain and during all-out efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SS25-LUXE-AllDay-16x9-6_2000x.webp\" alt=\"Riders climb on a gravel road wearing Velocio's Luxe range of apparel. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SS25-LUXE-AllDay-16x9-6_2000x.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SS25-LUXE-AllDay-16x9-6_2000x-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SS25-LUXE-AllDay-16x9-6_2000x-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SS25-LUXE-AllDay-16x9-6_2000x-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SS25-LUXE-AllDay-16x9-6_2000x-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SS25-LUXE-AllDay-16x9-6_2000x-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>Velocio Luxe is a premium kit for grand adventures.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve received a Merino Luxe Jersey for testing, so stay tuned for a full review. Initial impressions are highly positive, but being that crafting an aerodynamic jersey predominantly from wool is a rather novel approach, there may be some things to consider, such as temperature range and what sort of abuse the fabric will tolerate. That said, Velocio boasts that the Merino Luxe Jerseys will prove their worth more clearly on a century ride than on a lunch ride, as the materials and fit will help soothe riders who have been subjected to the elements and a high effort level hour after hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Merino Luxe Color Block Jersey uses the same pattern, fit, and material composition as the Merino Luxe, but features two-tone colorways that transition at the naval. Both the new Luxe jerseys are made in Italy, and according to Velocio, are sewn in a factory that also produces apparel for World Cup soccer teams and Olympic skiers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Velocio Didn’t Break the Luxe Bib Short (Hooray!)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VelocioButts.webp\" alt=\"4 riders cruise down a tree-lined road wearing Velocio Luxe apparel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VelocioButts.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VelocioButts-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VelocioButts-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VelocioButts-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VelocioButts-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VelocioButts-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>Look good…feel good…ride good.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Luxe Bib Short has been redesigned. Writing that sentence gave me some anxiety, as the outgoing Luxe bib short is my hands-down favorite bib short of all time. Thankfully, not much has changed, tangibly. The 2025 Luxe bib short features an updated chamois for improved support, new recycled fabric, and refined upper and waistline. From my initial riding impressions, the shell fabric feels slightly thinner and stretchier, but retains enough of the hearty support and compression that makes the original Luxe so special for big rides in variable temperatures. That’s the only difference I could feel, and I wouldn’t hesitate to use the 2025 version on anything from a credit card tour, to an Everesting, or any ride with a healthy percentage of gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, we have received both the Merino Luxe Jersey and updated Luxe Bib Short for testing, and will have an in-depth review coming soon. The Merino Luxe and Merino Luxe Colorblock Jerseys sell for $199.00, and the Luxe Bib Short is $289.00.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fit Notes + First Impressions (From Zach)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bennett’s love of the original Luxe Bib Short highlights the challenge of creating form-fitting cycling clothing for a wide range of bodies, with just a few stock sizes. Personally, I never got along with the original Luxe bib, as they were too long in the leg, and too tight around the waist. I was excited to hear that the new version had a refined waist – I figured with that, along with losing 10 pounds, would mean a much better fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 5’8″, and 150lbs, the new Luxe bibs do fit me better, but they’re still not ideal for me. I find them a little tight in the mid-section, and about an inch too long in the leg. Going to a medium would likely make the waist more comfortable, but the leg would then be past my knees. These are still cut to fit taller, skinnier riders, so Bennett, who is 6′, 165lbs (and wears medium bibs/small jerseys), will still love them! Personally, the Velocio Utility Bib Short is a better fit for me, which is being rebranded as the Adventure Cargo Bib Short with the same design and a few updates for 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Merino Luxe Jersey on the other hand, is one of <em>my</em> all-time favorites – and not just from Velocio. Previous road jerseys from Velocio have been too tight in the arms, shoulders, and chest for my liking, which puts a lot of stress on the zipper. Not here. More importantly, while there is ample room in the upper section of the jersey, the mid-section tapers down to the waist and keeps it from being loose and puckery at the front. The mesh back panel keeps the jersey fairly cool, even in warmer conditions, and the pockets are well constructed to maintain support when loaded. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Velocio htSQD Skinsuit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3646-copy-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Keegan Sweson rides gravel in the Velocio htSQD skinsuit.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3646-copy-jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3646-copy-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3646-copy-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3646-copy-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3646-copy-768x512.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Alexis Skarda is one of four riders with access to the Velocio htSQD Skintuit.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While available at this time only to the htSQD XC/Gravel team athletes, the Velocio htSQD Skinsuit showcases the Velocio approach to design with the objective of generating free speed. Much of the design and technology found in the htSQD Skinsuit carries over to Velocio’s race-focused Concept line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skinsuits have had an interesting trajectory over the last decade, since they first began to appear regularly across all disciplines, most notably in mass start road racing around 2010. While they do offer an undeniable aero benefit, fit can be a bit tricky for people who need a differently-sized jersey and bib shorts, so comfort is often a concern. Another concern, specifically for gravel, is practical storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An Athlete-Focused Collaboration</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0844-copy-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Velocio's Brad Sheehan, works with htSQD riders to develop the skinsuit. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0844-copy-jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0844-copy-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0844-copy-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0844-copy-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0844-copy-768x512.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Velocio founder and designer, Brad Sheehan, worked closely with htSQD riders to develop the skinsuit. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“A skinsuit is a pretty crucial piece for us as athletes,” says htSQD team member Keegan Swenson. “It’s the fastest thing you could wear. These races are so long and so fast now that a couple watts here or there makes a big difference.” With that in mind, htSQD approached Velocio looking for a no-compromise solution, and found it, thanks to the deep design experience and skill of founder Brad Sheehan. A former Cat 1 road racer, Sheehan helped craft race apparel for a slew of professional teams, including Columbia-Highroad, Columbia HTC, HTC Highroad—and later, Specialized-Lululemon, before founding Velocio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"8129\" height=\"5422\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Testing the Velocio htSQD skinsuit in the desert\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-jpg.webp 8129w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7343-copy-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The southern AZ desert was one of the proving grounds of the htSQD skintuit.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheehan worked closely with all four htSQD riders – Alexis Skarda, Ruth Holcomb, Tobin Ornetblad, and Keegan Swenson – to perfect the fit and details of the skinsuit. While most professional riders simply wear whatever a sponsor hands them, this was a truly collaborative endeavor. Swenson asked for a special mesh pocket just for storing empty wrappers, and Sheehan delivered. Not only does this feature help htSQD keep nutrition organized during races, it helps keep trash out of the communities that host gravel events, and helps further Velocio’s sustainability goals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these athlete-only skinsuits are custom-tailored for the htSQD, we hope that the learnings from this project and result in a skinsuit that is offered to the public. If any company could perfectly balance aero efficiency, comfort, and practicality in a skinsuit, it’s Velocio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/luxe\">velocio.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/velocio-luxe-collection-wool-jersey/\">The Velocio Luxe Collection is Crafted for the Longest Rides</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"fab1c0394dfc255a5d98cd8e4d8c24535b4c1a232bb48779b1e74604b3bd6765","category":"Cycling"}
