{"title":"Limited Edition: Atoms × MKBHD Sneaker M251","link":"https://atoms.com/df251","date":1682900994000,"content":"\n<p>My thanks to Atoms for sponsoring last week to promote their sweet new sneakers: a limited edition collaboration with Marques Brownlee. The mid-top Model 251 sneaker features a sleek design that blends style and comfort, paying homage to Marques’s first YouTube video — 2m:51s long — and the start of his journey as a creator. </p>\n\n<p>They hooked me up with a pair and they are <em>nice</em>. (Where’s that chef’s kiss emoji?) Same great fit and comfort as regular Atoms, with a very distinct look. I don’t even need to tell you the colors. Available only until May 23 — check them out while they’re available.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/30/atoms-mkbhd-m251\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"954a8261ed25670155c72f8ded8d29d7bca481ef681f009aef1310e50d18b7b3","category":"Tech"}
