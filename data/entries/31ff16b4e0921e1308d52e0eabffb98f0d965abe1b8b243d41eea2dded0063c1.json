The ‌iPhone 13‌ mini has a 2,406 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13‌ has a 3,227 mAh battery, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ has a 3,095 mAh battery, and the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max has a 4,352 mAh battery.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niFixit's live teardown is interesting for those who want to see a step-by-step deconstruction of the device, but there's not a lot of new information to learn at this point. iFixit plans to publish a more in-depth teardown next week, which should give us some more insight on the internal components.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/24/ifixit-iphone-13-live-teardown/\">iFixit Shares Live Teardown of the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-live-teardown-of-the-iphone-13-and-13-pro.2313183/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=q9cX5tZJmWI:ZLgLoj3lErM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=q9cX5tZJmWI:ZLgLoj3lErM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/q9cX5tZJmWI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"31ff16b4e0921e1308d52e0eabffb98f0d965abe1b8b243d41eea2dded0063c1","category":"Apple"}
