And while it isn’t always so prominent, argyle makes a strong return, almost two decades after its origins with the team as Slipstream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now though, the diamond pattern of argyle gets accentuated by a smattering of virtual diamond gemstones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>“Diamonds are made under pressure”</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha EF Pro Cycling pink argyle tease new Pro Team kit, Nina Kessler\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-jpg.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Rapha-EF-Pro-Cycling-pink-argyle-Pro-Team-kit_Nina-Kessler-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The women and men of EF Pro Cycling are a rare species, forged out of the terrain and the sport they inhabit.
