{"title":"New – Amazon S3 Dual-Layer Server-Side Encryption with Keys Stored in AWS Key Management Service (DSSE-KMS)","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-dual-layer-server-side-encryption-with-keys-stored-in-aws-key-management-service-dsse-kms/","date":1686676257000,"content":"<p>Today, we are launching <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?trk=89c56d48-a612-4193-aa02-7ec29ff9a2db&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon S3</a> dual-layer server-side encryption with keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (DSSE-KMS), a new encryption option in S3 that applies two layers of encryption to objects when they are uploaded to an S3 bucket. DSSE-KMS is designed to meet National Security Agency CNSSP 15 for FIPS compliance and Data-at-Rest Capability Package (DAR CP) Version 5.0 guidance for two layers of CNSA encryption. Using DSSE-KMS, you can fulfill regulatory requirements to apply multiple layers of encryption to your data.</p> \n<p>Amazon S3 is the only cloud object storage service where customers can apply two layers of encryption at the object level and control the data keys used for both layers. DSSE-KMS makes it easier for highly regulated customers to fulfill rigorous security standards, such as US Department of Defense (DoD) customers.</p> \n<p>With DSSE-KMS, you can specify dual-layer server-side encryption (DSSE) in the PUT or COPY request for an object or configure your S3 bucket to apply DSSE to all new objects by default. You can also enforce DSSE-KMS using IAM and bucket policies. Each layer of encryption uses a separate cryptographic implementation library with individual data encryption keys. DSSE-KMS helps protect sensitive data against the low probability of a vulnerability in a single layer of cryptographic implementation.</p> \n<p>DSSE-KMS simplifies the process of applying two layers of encryption to your data, without having to invest in infrastructure required for client-side encryption. Each layer of encryption uses a different implementation of the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) algorithm. DSSE-KMS uses the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to generate data keys, allowing you to control your customer managed keys by setting permissions per key and specifying key rotation schedules. With DSSE-KMS, you can now query and analyze your dual-encrypted data with AWS services such as Amazon Athena, Amazon SageMaker, and more.</p> \n<p>With this launch, Amazon S3 now offers four options for server-side encryption:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)</li> \n <li>Server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)</li> \n <li>Server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)</li> \n <li>Dual-layer server-side encryption with keys stored in KMS (DSSE-KMS)</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Let’s see how DSSE-KMS works in practice.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Create an S3 Bucket and Turn on DSSE-KMS</strong></span><br /> To create a new bucket in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3\">Amazon S3 console</a>, I choose <strong>Buckets</strong> in the navigation pane. I choose <strong>Create bucket</strong>, and I select a unique and meaningful name for the bucket. Under <strong>Default encryption</strong> section, I choose DSSE-KMS as the encryption option. From the available AWS KMS keys, I select a key for my requirements. Finally, I choose <strong>Create bucket</strong> to complete the creation of the S3 bucket, encrypted by DSSE-KMS encryption settings.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/08/Encryption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/08/Encryption.png\" alt=\"Encryption\" width=\"977\" height=\"510\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Upload an Object to the DSSE-SSE enabled S3 Bucket</strong></span><br /> In the <strong>Buckets</strong> list, I choose the name of the bucket that I want to upload an object to. On the <strong>Objects</strong> tab for the bucket, I choose <strong>Upload</strong>. Under <strong>Files and folders</strong>, I choose <strong>Add files</strong>. I then choose a file to upload, and then choose <strong>Open</strong>. Under <strong>Server-side encryption</strong>, I choose <strong>Do not specify an encryption key</strong>. I then choose <strong>Upload</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/08/Server-Side-Encryption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/08/Server-Side-Encryption.png\" alt=\"Server Side Encryption\" width=\"977\" height=\"437\" /></a></p> \n<p>Once the object is uploaded to the S3 bucket, I notice that the uploaded object inherits the <strong>Server-side encryption</strong> <strong>settings</strong> from the bucket.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/08/Server-Side-Encryption-Setting.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/06/08/Server-Side-Encryption-Setting.png\" alt=\"Server Side Encryption Setting\" width=\"977\" height=\"306\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Download a DSSE-KMS Encrypted Object from an S3 Bucket</strong></span><br /> I select the object that I previously uploaded and choose <strong>Download</strong> or choose <strong>Download as</strong> from the <strong>Object actions</strong> menu. Once the object is downloaded, I open it locally, and the object is decrypted automatically, requiring no change to client applications.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br /> Amazon S3 dual-layer server-side encryption with keys stored in AWS KMS (DSSE-KMS) is available today in all AWS Regions.
