The 2024 cycling season is officially underway with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/womens-tour-down-under-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Women’s Tour Down Under</a> and I couldn’t be more excited. You should also check out the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-2024-red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">new EF Pro Cycling national champions’ kits</a>, they’re absolutely magnificent. Don’t just take my word for it, as they also placed very highly in our 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2024-pro-cycling-kit\" target=\"_blank\">kit rankings</a>. Sorry for the spoilers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the <em>Cyclist</em> team has been busy with reviews. If you’re out and about on the bike, Katherine has collated the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes-for-winter-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">best winter shoes</a> for riding, so keep those tootsies warm, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">best winter cycling gloves</a>, so keep those fingies warm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re participating in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ridelondon\" target=\"_blank\">RideLondon</a> this May, it’s never too early to start preparing for it. Emma has put together <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-2024\" target=\"_blank\">a guide to the event</a>, including a breakdown of the routes, which bikes are allowed and the nutrition provided. Charlotte followed this up with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sportive-bike-maintenance-checks\" target=\"_blank\">5 key maintenance tips</a> and what to avoid ahead of the big day, which is worthwhile reading because you can’t leave it too late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s get into it.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2024-pro-cycling-kit\">All the 2024 WorldTour kits ranked from worst to first</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-2024-red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\">Pro Log: Red Bull acquires controlling stake in Bora-Hansgrohe, Australian National Championships results, EF release stunning kits and Julien Vermote signs for Visma-Lease a Bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\">Best winter cycling gloves 2024: Keep your hands warm in cold weather</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Shock Absorber Padded Run Bra </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Shock-Absorber-Bra-970x728.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Shock-Absorber-Bra-970x728.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Shock-Absorber-Bra-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Shock-Absorber-Bra-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Shock-Absorber-Bra-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Shock-Absorber-Bra-1140x855.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Shock-Absorber-Bra.jpeg 1417w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This sports bra is from Shock Absorber, a company specialising in bounce control that tests all its bras at the University of Portsmouth’s breast health department. As someone with a bigger chest, I find I need the maximum amount of support possible when exercising. A lot of online retailers tend to edge towards minimum support, which just isn’t something I would ever pick up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Padded Run Bra has moulded cups instead of just using compression or offering no support. The straps are wide and adjustable with eight different spaces to fit the hook into – although this bit I did find fiddly even without my usual acrylic nails on. The band at the bottom sits snug just below my chest and doesn’t slip during exercise. The brand claims to reduce bounce by up to 78%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my new go-to sports bra. It also helps that it’s pink and I’m still in a Barbie-movie headspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fboobydoo.co.uk%2Fshock-absorber-padded-run-bra%2F%3Fsku%3DSA_U10057_RS508_32E\" target=\"_blank\">Boobydoo (£41.60)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Barebells protein bars</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-970x728.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-970x728.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Barebells-Bars-1140x855.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These protein bars from Barebells come in a variety of flavours, including the pictured Cookies &amp; Cream, Caramel Choco, White Chocolate Almond and Salted Peanut Caramel. They contain a high amount of protein (either 16g or 20g depending on which you choose), so are ideal for snacking on beforehand or during a ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was surprised how much you get for your money with these due to the size. They’re thicker than all the protein bars I’ve previously tried, so will fit in either a pocket or bar bag. Or maybe you might want to split it up or eat it post-ride. Who am I to tell you what to do? They taste phenomenal; my favourite is the Cookies &amp; Cream, just FYI. An absolute treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also softer bars available should you prefer it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbarebells.co.uk%2Fproduct%2Fbarebells-selection-box%2F%3F_gl%3D1*1bgbzql*_up*MQ..%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiA44OtBhAOEiwAj4gpOdSAxg8CQaSYIydXMLLI48B8Qs6EwYAUdsaI7KnHpWTss2NMpuR1HBoC0UoQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Barebells (£24.99 for 12)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ROUVY partners with Lidl-Trek, providing users the opportunity to ride like the pros</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"lidl-trek riders using rouvy\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/rouvy-lidl-trek.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>ROUVY, the indoor cycling app which lets you ride real routes around the world, has announced a new technical partnership with pro cycling team Lidl-Trek.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can now ride a virtual TREK Madone bike and proudly don the exclusive Virtual Lidl-Trek Jersey during races, showing their support for the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive training plan designed by Lidl-Trek’s performance experts will be made available on ROUVY, allowing users to train like the pros and improve their performance and riders can follow in the tire tracks of their Lidl-Trek heroes, comparing their own times on the routes the pros have conquered</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://rouvy.com/press/ROUVY-lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Learn more</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature ends</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: (Trying to go) Running</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/07100800/froome_running_pressesports_572991_tdf_104-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"froome_running_pressesports_572991_tdf_104\" /><figcaption>Presse Sports</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I became the very thing I said I wouldn’t. Someone who (dramatic pause…….) is attempting to become a runner. You know, outside is free and all that. Plus given the new year upon us, it’s nice to have some non-work related goals in mind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don’t really know the first thing about running except to buy some decent shoes and just take off. I’m going to base this off vibes alone, see where I’m at and attempt to improve on it. Albeit I’m quite the perfectionist and will greatly be impacted should my fitness not improve. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll check back in for my next In the Drops, but don’t hold this against me.
