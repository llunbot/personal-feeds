Fairlight makes the steel frame in both regular and tall variants, to suit different rider morphology, with each bike built to order so you can choose your own spec.</p>\n<p>There’s plenty of room for wide tyres – 36mm – and mudguards to get you through the worst of the weather. Endurance features include a third bottle cage mount.</p>\n<p>We rated the ride quality as unobtrusive – the frame does a great job of smoothing the road, holds a line and climbs well and – as usual – we took in some bridleways on wider tyres, which were handled with ease.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/fairlight-strael-3-0-review/\">Read our full Fairlight Strael 3.0 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Giant Defy Advanced 0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Giant Defy Advanced 0 is one of the cheaper and better bikes in its category.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£2,899 / £4,350 as tested</li>\n<li>Outstanding value</li>\n<li>Excellent drivetrain</li>\n<li>Comfortable</li>\n<li>Precise handling</li>\n</ul><p>The Giant Defy Advanced 0 is nearly perfect for its very reasonable price (for a modern endurance road bike).</p>\n<p>The superbly designed frame and 32mm tubeless tyres contribute to a plush, yet by no means dull, ride experience.</p>\n<p>The highlight of a top-value spec is the SRAM Rival eTap AXS groupset.

But rather than the race-targetted machine that this would usually indicate, it’s an endurance bike with a higher stack for all-day riding. That’s offset by deeper drops than found on most endurance bikes though, so you can get lower if you want an extra turn of speed.</p>\n<p>In this spec, it’s kitted out with a 52/36t Ultegra 12-speed groupset with 11-34t cassette and 40mm deep Vision carbon wheels with 28mm Hutchinson tyres.</p>\n<p>The ride is firmer than on many endurance bikes and handling is racier as well. Unlike many endurance bikes, you don’t get mudguard eyes, perhaps reflecting the weather in BH’s Spanish home. But overall it’s a great option for riders looking to ride fast as well as long.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/bh-rs1-5-0-review/\">Read our full BH RS1 5.0 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cannondale Synapse Carbon LTD RLE</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cannondale Synapse Carbon LTD RLE is our Endurance Bike of the Year winner for 2022.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£6,750 / $7,050 / €6,999 as tested</li>\n<li>Supple smoothness and exciting handling</li>\n<li>35mm tyre clearance and all-terrain ability</li>\n<li>Integrated lights</li>\n</ul><p>Our 2022 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-year/\">Endurance Bike of the Year</a>, the Synapse LTD RLE has Cannondale’s SmartSense integrated central battery and lights, a smart wheel sensor and a Garmin Varia rear-view radar in the spec.</p>\n<p>It’s not just about the added safety features though.

They’re intended to take away some of the fatigue induced by road imperfections on an all-day ride.</p>\n<p>Endurance road bikes tend to have wider tyres than race bikes, to aid comfort and help create a smoother ride.</p>\n<p>While the latest race bikes are generally limited to a maximum <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-tyre-sizes/\">tyre size</a> of 28 to 32mm (though this is much wider than just a few years ago, thanks to the rise of disc brakes), some of the latest endurance road bikes have room for 35mm or wider tyres – which is wider than the tyres on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">cyclocross bikes</a> and not far off some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Endurance road bikes also tend to have a lower gear range than race bikes. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-compact-crank/\">Compact 50/34t chainsets</a> and cassettes with 32-tooth sprockets are not uncommon and some bikes will even have a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">sub-compact chainset</a>, which will help you crest steep ascents at the end of a long day.</p>\n<p>Greater versatility is built into endurance road bikes, too. Race bikes might forgo features such as mudguard mounts, but endurance road bikes tend to have these and are consequently better for riding all-year round.</p>\n<h3>Frame details</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mudguard mounts make endurance road bikes more practical than many race bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Endurance road bikes are made with a range of different <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a>. Most of the bikes in this list have an all-carbon frame, which helps create a lightweight and compliant ride. Having said this, alloy frames can be designed to be very compliant and tend to offer a price saving.</p>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-road-bikes/\">best steel road bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-titanium-road-bikes/\">best titanium road bikes</a> fall into the endurance road bike category, too. These materials tend to be favoured for comfort-orientated, long-distance bikes because they both do a great job of absorbing any road buzz.</p>\n<p>You might want to look for an endurance road bike with mudguard mounts. They used to be a rarity, but you’ll increasingly find them even on top-end endurance machines and they’re often hidden so they don’t spoil the bike’s aesthetics if you decide not to fit guards.</p>\n<p>If you’re lucky to go out on dry roads, you may not need them. But if the heavens open on the day of your ride, you will enjoy it much more if your bike is fitted with mudguards and you and your bike are protected from wheel spray. And if you’re riding in a group, those following you will definitely thank you.</p>\n<p>Mudguards are also a good bet through winter if you live somewhere with a wet climate, making an endurance road bike a good choice for a four-seasons machine.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">best mudguards</a> normally require mounts on the frame to provide full coverage, so look out for a frame with the appropriate mounting points if that’s important to you.</p>\n<h3>What is endurance road bike geometry?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endurance bikes can look a lot like race bikes, but the geometry often puts the rider in a more upright position.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many bike brands will label their bikes as having either racing or endurance geometry.</p>\n<p>Racing geometry will typically give you faster handling, a lower position and the ride may be firmer, whereas endurance geometry gives a more upright riding position and more stable handling.</p>\n<p>All our picks above are from the brands’ endurance road bike ranges. You can also read our explainer on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">road bike geometry</a> to better understand the angles and measurements involved.</p>\n<h3>Are endurance road bikes slow?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endurance bikes might be designed around comfort, but this doesn’t stop them from being fun to ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On the face of it, endurance road bikes might seem like a slower option if you compare them to WorldTour-ready <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">lightweight race bikes</a> or the fastest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Firstly, this is because the more upright position of endurance road bikes means you are less aerodynamic than on more aggressive road bikes, and consequently it takes more effort to travel at the same speeds.</p>\n<p>And while <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/are-wider-tyres-faster/\">wider tyres can often be faster than old-school narrow tyres</a>, there may be an aero, rolling resistance or weight penalty here, too, if your endurance road bike is using all of its generous frame clearance.</p>\n<p>Having said this, endurance road bikes, like all bikes, exist on a spectrum and there are some that have racier geometries than others. On top of that, the latest endurance road bikes occupy a finely balanced sweet spot between speed and comfort.</p>\n<p>Many still enable you to adopt a fairly low position, so don’t worry too much about your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/average-speed-cycling/\">average speed</a>. Almost all will feel markedly quicker than a gravel bike or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-touring-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">touring bike</a>.</p>\n<p>And remember, endurance bikes place a greater focus on comfort. So whether that enables you to ride further, or gives you the option for light off-road detours, you’ll ultimately end up at your destination quicker than a race bike with an uncomfortable position and limited versatility.</p>\n<h3>Endurance road bike gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endurance bikes tend to have compact gears, like the 50/34t chainset pictured here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Endurance bikes are designed to meet the challenge of long rides over up and down terrain, enabling riders to tackle it in relative comfort, rather than being forced to turn a massive gear.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to take on sportives, these are designed to give you a bit of a challenge and much of the ride is often on rolling terrain. Most sportives will throw in a few steeper hills, while some routes take you up and down as much elevation as possible. That means having a good gear range is paramount.</p>\n<p>A compact chainset with 50- and 34-tooth chainrings is a good starting point for any endurance bike.</p>\n<p>At the back, you’ll normally get a cassette that goes from 11 teeth for its smallest sprocket (or 10 teeth for SRAM’s eTap AXS 12-speed groupsets) up to 30, 34 or more teeth for its largest.</p>\n<p>That should give you plenty of low range to tackle steeper uphills, with lowest ratios close to or below 1:1. You’ll also have enough top-end gears to ride comfortably on faster, flatter sections.</p>\n<p>Some brands may spec a semi-compact 52/36t chainset on their endurance bikes. These give you a bit more top-end gearing, but paired with a wide-range cassette you still have the lower gears for easier climbing.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re relatively new to cycling, live in a hilly area or are planning on taking your bike to the mountains, a compact will give you more gearing options for climbing.</p>\n<h3>Groupset</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano 105 is a popular groupset on mid-range endurance road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupset</a> will give you light, precise shifting, with a broad range of gears for a wide variety of terrain.</p>\n<p>Most endurance bikes come with 11-speed or 12-speed groupsets. Shimano groupsets are most common, with Ultegra or 105 seen on mid-range bikes, though don’t discount Shimano Tiagra on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-under-1000/\">bikes around £1,000</a> – the 10-speed groupset still provides excellent shifting and braking.</p>\n<p>Higher-end bikes are increasingly coming with 12-speed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a>. 105 Di2 is the starting point for Shimano, but on a top-end machine look for Shimano Ultegra or Dura-Ace.</p>\n<p>All have recently been updated, with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-105-di2-weight/\">Shimano 105 Di2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-ultegra-di2-r8100/\">Shimano Ultegra R8100</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9200-review/\">Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200</a> now being 12-speed and electronic only.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo and SRAM also have 12-speed electronic options, with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">SRAM Red eTap AXS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-force-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM Force eTap AXS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM Rival eTap AXS</a> offering wireless shifting. Both brands also offer more affordable mechanical groupsets.</p>\n<h3>Brakes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes are almost standard on endurance road bikes, but there are a few rare exceptions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Modern bikes are almost entirely equipped with disc brakes.</p>\n<p>Disc brakes will give you more consistent braking performance, in the wet or dry, than rim brakes and usually more outright stopping power or modulation.</p>\n<p>They’re a pricier option than traditional rim brakes, although you can now find discs even on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cheap-road-bikes/\">entry-level road bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Disc brakes can be either hydraulic or mechanical. Hydraulic disc brakes are more effective, but they’re also pricier, so you’ll find them on higher-spec machines.</p>\n<p>Rim brakes are fine in drier weather, but you need to be more careful how you ride if it’s wet (and especially if your bike has carbon rims), allowing for more stopping distance.</p>\n<h3>Saddle</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Finding the right saddle for your anatomy is important for comfort on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>You’ll want to be comfortable as you ride and a good-quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-saddles/\">saddle</a> that suits your anatomy is important. There’s a huge range of options. Many endurance-oriented bikes will come fitted with a quality saddle, which you might find perfectly serviceable.</p>\n<p>However, if you find that you don’t get on with your saddle, it’s worth swapping out for another model. Aftermarket saddles come at a range of price points and most saddle ranges will have a budget option. It will be heavier than a pricier saddle further up the range, but should have similar ride characteristics. More expensive saddles typically come with carbon rails to drop the weight.</p>\n<p>Saddle brands usually have a fitting system to narrow down your choice, so it’s worth trying these. For some, you’ll need to find a dealer, while for others you can input your details online and get a selection of models to choose from.</p>\n<p>Some brands will offer the option to try before you buy or return a saddle after you’ve used it a little, if you don’t get on with it. It’s worth trying some options rather than suffering in silence.</p>\n<h3>Tyres</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A Cannondale Synapse fitted with 32mm-wide tyres. The latest endurance bikes offer clearance for plush tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>It used to be that most bikes came with 23mm-wide tyres, but most newer road bikes will come with at least 25mm – and even this is considered narrow by today’s standards.</p>\n<p>The trend now is for even wider tyres of 28mm or more, and our endurance road bike picks come with rubber that’s 32mm or even wider in some cases.</p>\n<p>The extra width means that you can drop the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressure on your road bike</a> without sacrificing speed and add a lot more comfort and grip to your ride.</p>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">best road wheelsets </a>also offer the option to run tubeless tyres. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">best tubeless ty</a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">res</a> let you lower your tyre pressure even more, add puncture protection by removing the need for an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tube</a> and may save a bit of weight too.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ddc6a6dc0b3cdbef9502c384202bf560db212d92eb34b51cc34981","category":"Cycling"}
