But in another <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Oklahoma-Firefighters-Pension-v-Musk-Request-for-Oral-Argument-7-3-2024.pdf\">court filing</a> this week, Musk insisted that \"all indications\"—including those referenced in the firefighters' complaint—\"point to mistake,\" not fraud.</p>\n<p>According to Musk, evidence showed that he simply misunderstood the Securities Exchange Act when he delayed filing a Rule 13 disclosure of his nearly 10 percent ownership stake in Twitter in March 2022. Musk argued that he believed he was required to disclose this stake at the end of the year, rather than within 10 days after the month in which he amassed a 5 percent stake. He said that previously he'd only filed Rule 13 disclosures as the owner of a company—not as someone suddenly acquiring 5 percent stake.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035344#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035344&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"50599b39772c684e898d88fb574c29dadaeb490f1b5e34175252b030ec0a71bf","category":"Tech"}
