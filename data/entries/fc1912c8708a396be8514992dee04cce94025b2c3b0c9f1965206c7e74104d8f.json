And today you can get set up for less: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542AM-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling a four-pack of AirTags for $80</a>, a savings of $25 and $36 less than you’d pay separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AirTags are circular Bluetooth trackers that add Find My tracking to keys, bags, and other items that aren’t made by Apple. The small white-and-chrome discs connect to the app just like an iPhone or MacBook and alert you when something is left behind and can help you find something that goes missing. A lost item attached to an AirTag can tap into the vast Find My network to track it down and they’re small and light enough to fit just about anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deal brings the per-AirTag cost down to less than $20 (versus $29 normally), so if you want to stop losing your valuable stuff, go grab a pack right now.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fc1912c8708a396be8514992dee04cce94025b2c3b0c9f1965206c7e74104d8f","category":"Apple"}
