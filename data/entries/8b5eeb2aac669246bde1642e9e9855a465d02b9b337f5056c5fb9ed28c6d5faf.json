Despite <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/\">fears</a> that the Trump administration would roll back safety regulations as it has for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-trumps-epa-hopes-to-avoid-greenhouse-gas-regulations/\">air</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/after-trump-killed-a-report-on-nature-researchers-push-ahead-with-release/\">water</a> standards, crashes involving autonomous or partially automated vehicles must still be reported to the government. And now, domestic autonomous vehicle developers will be able to benefit from exemptions previously only offered to foreign companies.</p>\n<p>\"This administration understands that we're in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,\" said US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement. \"As part of DOT's innovation agenda, our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety,\" Duffy said.</p>\n<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2025-04/third-amended-SGO-2021-01_2025.pdf\">is keeping its Standing General Order</a>, which requires manufacturers of autonomous or partially automated vehicles to report crashes that occur with such systems on public roads. Crashes using either autonomous driving systems or a partially automated system like GM's Super Cruise or Tesla's Autopilot must be reported within 10 days if anyone involved was killed or taken to hospital, if a vulnerable road user was hit, if the airbags deployed, or if the vehicle had to be towed away from the crash.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/feds-ease-rules-for-autonomous-vehicle-testing-to-compete-with-china/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/feds-ease-rules-for-autonomous-vehicle-testing-to-compete-with-china/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
