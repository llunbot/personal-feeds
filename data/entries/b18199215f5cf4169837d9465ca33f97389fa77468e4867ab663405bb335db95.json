But if lawmakers go through with a ban on the social network owned by Chinese company ByteDance, the US could end up banning or restricting access to many more apps and technology products than just TikTok.</p>\n<p>A leading \"TikTok ban\" candidate is the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686/text\">RESTRICT Act</a>, or the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology Act. The bipartisan Senate bill was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/biden-helped-draft-bipartisan-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-nationwide/\">introduced</a> a month ago and endorsed by the White House in an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/07/statement-from-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-the-introduction-of-the-restrict-act/\">official statement</a> from National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/technology/white-house-congress-on-tiktok.html\">reportedly</a> provided feedback on a draft of the proposed law before it was announced.</p>\n<p>The bill doesn't actually guarantee that TikTok will be bannedâ€”its text doesn't even mention TikTok or ByteDance. But it would give the secretary of Commerce and president broad power to ban mobile or desktop applications and other types of technology products from countries regarded as threats to national security.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930021#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930021&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b18199215f5cf4169837d9465ca33f97389fa77468e4867ab663405bb335db95","category":"Tech"}
