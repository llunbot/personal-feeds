And that's OK.</p>\n<p>But sometimes it's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on just how accomplished these people are. Ayers, 36, flew the supersonic F-22 stealth aircraft in the international war against the Islamic State and rose to become a major in the US Air Force before being selected as a NASA astronaut in 2021. Oh, yeah, she also completed a master's degree in computational and applied mathematics at Rice University.</p>\n<p>For her first spaceflight, Ayers launched on the Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station in March. This flight got a fair amount of media attention, but that was largely because the arrival of Crew-10 allowed the Crew Dragon spacecraft to which Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were assigned to return home. Since then, Ayers has spent 50 days in space, astronauting. This included a spacewalk last week, her first, alongside veteran astronaut Anne McClain.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/tuesday-telescope-its-not-space-weather-but-weather-from-space/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/tuesday-telescope-its-not-space-weather-but-weather-from-space/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c641acbf29f5b8d1236be19ac7c00dce85700fd85555e3202cd89de7a9705e8","category":"Tech"}
