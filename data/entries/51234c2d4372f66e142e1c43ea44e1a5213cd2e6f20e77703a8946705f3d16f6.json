The report also raises questions as to why the National Academies has been quiet about the donations and has not conducted a review of whether the funds and other potential conflicts of interest influenced its reports. The Times notes that <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m105\">in 2019, the World Health Organization retracted two opioid guidance documents</a> after a review backed up concerns that the drafting process had been influenced by opioid manufacturers, including the Sacklers' Purdue Pharma.</p>\n<p>Members of the Sackler family owned and largely directed Purdue Pharma in the late 1990s when the company allegedly began aggressively and deceptively selling its highly addictive opioid painkiller, OxyContin. The Sacklers are estimated to have raked in more than $10 billion from opioid sales in the years after.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934115#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934115&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51234c2d4372f66e142e1c43ea44e1a5213cd2e6f20e77703a8946705f3d16f6","category":"Tech"}
