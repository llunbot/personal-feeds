It's the latest development for DARPA's Air Combat Evaluation program, which is trying to develop aerospace AI agents <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/air-combat-evolution\">that can be trusted</a> to perform safely.</p>\n<p>Human test pilots have a bit of a reputation thanks to popular culture—from <em>The Right Stuff</em> to <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, the profession has been portrayed as a place for loose cannons with a desire to go fast and break the rules. The reality is pretty far from that these days, especially where DARPA is concerned.</p>\n<p>The agency instead wants a machine-learning agent that can safely fly a real aircraft autonomously, with no violations of training rules. After all, neural networks have their own reputation—at this point well-earned—for finding ways to exploit situations <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/sony-trains-superhuman-ai-to-race-in-gran-turismo/\">that hadn't occurred to humans.</a> And the consequences when controlling a real jet fighter can be a lot more severe than just testing <em>in silico</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018649#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018649&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
