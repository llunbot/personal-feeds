The ban comes amid the publication's concerns over research integrity, consent, privacy, and intellectual property protection as generative AI tools increasingly permeate the world of science and art.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in November 1869, Nature publishes peer-reviewed research from various academic disciplines, mainly in science and technology.
