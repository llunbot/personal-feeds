{"title":"Kuo: Low-Cost Apple Vision Pro Might Be Canceled","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/","date":1695748394000,"content":"Apple <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple-vision-pro-shipment-growth-may-be-below-market-expectations-apple-vision-pro出貨成長可能低於市場預期-7a5eeb613ab0\">may have canceled plans</a> to produce a lower-cost version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, according to Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. There were multiple rumors of a lower-cost model coming out sometime around 2025, but that may not happen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nKuo does not give a reason for why the lower-cost headset may have been nixed, but he says that unless Apple significantly cuts down on cost, significant shipment growth in Vision Pro shipments may not happen in 2025. Kuo expects Apple to ship approximately 400,000 to 600,000 headsets in 2024, and he says that while it will provide an \"excellent experience,\" it may take \"longer than the market expects\" to become Apple's next star product. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nA second-generation version of the ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ is expected to go into mass production by the first half of 2027 \"at the latest,\" and Kuo says that it is possible there will be no hardware updates for the Vision Pro until then.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth <em>The Information</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em> have suggested that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-cheaper-ar-vr-headset/\">working on a more affordable version</a> of the ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ headset. The initial version will be priced at $3,500, which will put it out of reach of many Apple customers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe rumors have said that Apple is developing a budget-friendly model that could be closer in price to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, but given the high price of the current model, it is unclear how rapidly Apple could bring component costs down. If Apple does indeed continue work on a more affordable model, it could feature lower resolution internal displays and cheaper build materials. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/\">Kuo: Low-Cost Apple Vision Pro Might Be Canceled</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-low-cost-apple-vision-pro-might-be-canceled.2404831/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5aa7d137e69c9fd2378c9586bb0c39a01bb1041bcecff83d4a999afaf4f3f6be","category":"Apple"}
