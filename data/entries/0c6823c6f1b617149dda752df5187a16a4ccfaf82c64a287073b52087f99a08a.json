Perhaps you even have a document with them all in. It’s perfectly understandable, but definitely not safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that it’s important to use an original password for each account and update them on a regular basis, but it can be a Herculean task trying to retain that information in our heads. This is made even more challenging with different sites requiring specific mixtures of characters: this one demands at least two symbols and no capitals, while that one requires a mixture of cases and a minimum length. And then you have to change yet another password and feel like crying! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where password manager apps come in. They allow users to create one master password, after which the app takes care of logging into all other accounts. They even make recommendations for really secure passwords. Having only a single login to remember? That sounds good to us. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><p>PROMOTION</p><p><strong>End your password chaos with 1Password</strong></p></div><div><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1Password-Teams-in-meeting-17.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1240&amp;h=697&amp;crop=1\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div><p>\n</p><p>Are you ready to take control of your digital security?

Instead of having to memorize multiple complex passwords for each of the services you use you need only recall one password – or provide a fingerprint or Face ID – and the password manager will automatically fill in the required details for you. Just remember this is only as safe as the password you use to unlock access to all your passwords – so don’t lock them all behind an easy-to-guess password, like your pet’s name.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The password managers also offer various other features. For example, they can generate random, highly secure passwords for your accounts, they can warn you if your password has been compromised, and some can advise you about existing insecure passwords and support your efforts to update them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, security is a high priority—as the manager apps have the virtual keys to your kingdom—which is why all of the options listed below use high-grade encryption to protect your details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many also feature digital wallets so your bank details can be safely stored and used to make purchases online without having to root around in your pocket or bag for the card number and expiry date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These services don’t usually come for free, but many offer trials so you can see if it’s the solution for you. After that you’ll need to pay a small monthly fee, but we think that’s a price worth paying for only having to keep one password in your brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do you need a password manager? Is iCloud Keychain enough? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But do you need to buy a password manager when there is one in macOS, iOS and iPadOS? Apple provides iCloud Keychain, which will generate secure passwords and enter them for you automatically, all while storing them securely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>iCloud Keychain is incredibly useful, but it’s a bit basic and lacks some of the features offered by other password managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want to stay safe without having to recall hundreds of passwords, but want more control and features than you get from Apple’s free offering, here’s some of the best alternatives available for Mac, iPhone and iPad users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more ways to keep your data safe be sure to also read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432223/mac-security-tips-password-find-my-users-lockdown-mode.html\">Best Mac security tips</a> article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Password Managers for Mac and iPhone</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiCloud Keychain\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"iCloud Keychain\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3780912/alternative_to_icloud_keychain.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"iCloud Keychain\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"iCloud Keychain\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPart of iCloud: Free on 5GB plan \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.icloud.com&amp;xcust=1-1-668938-6-664849-9934&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$0 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>You may be wondering if you really need a password manager as Apple already includes a free one that works with your Mac, iPhone, iPad and any other Apple device linked to your Apple ID. </p>\n\n<p>iCloud Keychain is Apple’s password management system and it is built into macOS and iOS. It helps you to create secure passwords by generating them on your behalf, warns you if you reuse one or if a password is not secure, and auto-fills your passwords when needed. It’s all tied to your Apple ID login and password and the Apple devices you have registered for two-factor authentication, plus everything is encrypted, so it should be secure.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t just fill in passwords for you though: it also enters your logins, emails, credit card numbers, and address details. So you can effortlessly go to sites, choose the item you want to buy, then complete the transaction in seconds and without needing to dredge your memory or fill in loads of text boxes first.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main disadvantages in the past was that iCloud Keychain was restricted to Apple devices and Safari. However, Apple has since added Keychain support via a iCloud Password extension for Edge or Chrome, and the good news for PC users is that this means they can use iCloud for Windows. However, if you have an Android phone iCloud Keychain is redundant and you will need to find your password information and enter it manually (you can look up your passwords in your keychain in Settings &gt; Passwords). </p>\n\n<p>Another frustration we have with iCloud Keychain is that in our experience when we pick a iCloud Keychain suggested password it doesn’t always store it. After years of use our iCloud Keychain is confusingly cluttered with multiple password versions per account.</p>\n\n<p>iCloud Keychain is pretty much a solution for those who only use Apple devices and software. Luckily there are alternatives if you want a little more room to move. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1Password\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"1Password\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3780912/best_password_manager_1password1.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"1Password\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"1Password\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $2.99 per month, $36 a year\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://1password.com&amp;xcust=1-1-668938-6-648504-19596&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$36 at  1Password (annually)</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>One of our long-standing favorites is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://1password.com/business-pricing&amp;xcust=1-1-668938-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">1Password</a> which has a nice, clean layout and is simple to use.

AES 256-bit is the order of the day, and 1Password monitors the activity on your account so it can send you warnings if any odd behavior is spotted. It also uses the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, which allows you to authenticate your details to a site without the information being sent to a server which could compromise security.</p>\n\n<p>The Watchtower feature analyzes the overall strength of your online security and warns you if passwords are repeated or vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>A free 14-day trial is available, but after that, you’ll need to move on to a paid subscription that currently starts at $36 (approx £29) per year.

This recent history makes it harder to recommend. </p>\n\n<p>Not that security measures aren’t there, the company explains that it uses “AES 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes to ensure complete security in the cloud.”</p>\n\n<p>The app does all of its encryption locally, so LastPass never knows your master password, and the Premium tier also supports a form of two-factor authentication for another layer of security. This is called MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and not only allows confirmation text messages to be sent, but also works with biometrics (Face ID &amp; Touch ID) and even voice commands (although some of these methods are reserved for the Business plan).</p>\n\n<p>You can either use LastPass locally on your device via dedicated apps (macOS, iOS and iPadOS), or via the web with plugins and extensions available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge all of which allow you to automatically access login details for sites and accounts or have LastPass autofill the login fields on your behalf. </p>\n\n<p>Just like with other managers you have access to a vault where all of your passwords are stored, and these can be changed to more complex alternatives at the touch of a button. LastPass will also advise you on how secure your passwords are for your existing accounts. Getting set up is easy too, as you can import existing passwords from web browsers, email, and other password managers.</p>\n\n<p>The app offers a digital wallet to store your card details, plus another area for official ID such as passports and driving licenses. The Note section is a place where you can keep Wi-Fi passwords, insurance details and any other important documents that you need to access.
