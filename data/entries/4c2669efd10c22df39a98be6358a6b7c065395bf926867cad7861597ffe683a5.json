Tara helps developers make great software as quickly as possible. Here are three blockers they hear often from developers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Getting everyone aligned</em> — Get ideas across clearly with a clear problem statement and requirements. Use a tool like Tara to get sign-off before you start.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Visibility into actual progress</em> — Code changes are the best indicators of progress. Use tools that enable transparency. With Tara, everyone can see commits, blocks, and merges for a sense of true progress.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Manual status updates</em> — Manual updates are the achilles heel of every project. Use tools that automate tedious, low-value actions — like Tara’s auto-status that marks tasks as done when a PR merges.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One workspace for your team’s docs, sprints, and tasks synced to code. Plus an API for custom workflows. <a href=\"https://tara.ai/?ref=daringfireball\">Get started on Tara for free</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/09/tara-ai\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4c2669efd10c22df39a98be6358a6b7c065395bf926867cad7861597ffe683a5","category":"Tech"}
