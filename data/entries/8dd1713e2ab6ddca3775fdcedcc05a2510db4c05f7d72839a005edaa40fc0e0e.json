The device is expected to be priced around $1,700, which is in line with Samsung's pricing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Pixel-Fold-5K3-scaled.jpg\" alt width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" /><em><div>Render of Pixel Fold from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1600791543912484871\">OnLeaks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/08/google-pixel-fold-specs-leaked-2023-launch/\">based on leaked rumors</a></div></em>\r<br />\nThe Pixel Fold will be introduced at Google I/O in May, and Google plans to market it as a device with the \"most durable hinge\" on a foldable smartphone. When opened, the Google Fold will feature a 7.6-inch display (the same as the Galaxy Z Fold 4), and it will open up like a book. It will be water-resistant, sized to fit easily in a pocket when folded, and it will have a battery that is able to last for up to 24 hours.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost of Google's Pixel devices are relatively affordable, but the Pixel Fold will have a high price tag due to the cost of the display and the hinge. Google has already been adapting Android for foldable devices, and <em>CNBC</em> says that the Pixel Fold will allow it to better demonstrate what a Google-made foldable phone experience is like.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the Pixel Fold coming in June, Google will beat Apple to foldable smartphones. There are rumors that Apple has been experimenting with foldable iPhones, but the company could actually introduce the technology in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> first.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the current time, there is no solid word on just when Apple might introduce its first foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, but analysts have suggested it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/\">won't come until 2025</a> at the earliest.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/google-pixel-fold-june-launch/\">Google Plans to Launch $1,700 Foldable Smartphone in June</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-plans-to-launch-1-700-foldable-smartphone-in-june.2387161/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8dd1713e2ab6ddca3775fdcedcc05a2510db4c05f7d72839a005edaa40fc0e0e","category":"Apple"}
