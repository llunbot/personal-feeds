The $137 DB8 has an “ambidextrous” lever design and a removable MMX clamp, both of which are nearly ubiquitous across nearly all SRAM brakes. But the DB6 and DB4 are left-right specific, and neither features the removable MMX clamp, instead using a more traditional integrated split clamp.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db-caliper-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db-caliper-01.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db-caliper-01.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db-caliper-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db6-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db6-01.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db6-01.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-db6-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The integrated clamp on the DB6 brake lever still fits SRAM’s MatchMaker X system that allows you to mount a shifter or dropper lever directly to the brake-lever clamp itself. But to save cost, the DB4 is not compatible with MatchMaker X. Aside from that, the internals of each lever are the same. In fact, despite looking quite different from the DB8, all three brakes will have identical power and on-trail feel, according to SRAM. The caliper architecture is the same across the DB4, DB6, and DB8.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Maven Base ($185)</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/promising-but-inconclusive-a-sram-maven-disc-brake-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Maven</a> Base doesn’t look like much of a departure on the surface. It’s still got an ambidextrous shape, removable MMX clamp, and tool-free reach adjustment as the next-level-up Maven Bronze. It’s even got the same price as the Bronze. But SRAM made some pretty interesting choices. They started by replacing the Swing Link lever linkage with a simpler Direct Link design.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-01.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/sram-brakes-maven-base-01.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This means there isn’t as steeply progressive of a power curve as you increase your force on the levers. But the goal was to deliver the same braking force for most of the powerband. To achieve this, the Maven Base caliper has four matching 18mm pistons instead of the rest of the Mavens’ 18mm/19.5mm pistons. SRAM claims the Maven Base’s overall power delivery and feel will match other Maven models in most situations, but will not offer quite the same peak power under extremely forceful braking.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram/mountain/collections/brakes\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-maven-base-db4-db6-mineral-oil-brakes/\">SRAM Introduces Lower-Price Maven Base, DB4, and DB6 Brakes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f139cb5b5be879d98f56536b70b9ee97f86090ba00edb0d253161e3f63e559c1","category":"Cycling"}
