Last year, the US reached <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/gonorrhea-is-becoming-unstoppable-highly-resistant-cases-found-in-us/\">a grim landmark</a>: For the first time, two unrelated people in Massachusetts were found to have gonorrhea infections with complete or reduced susceptibility to every drug in our arsenal, including the frontline drug ceftriaxone. Luckily, they were still able to be cured with high-dose injections of ceftriaxone. But, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bluntly notes: \"Little now stands between us and untreatable gonorrhea.\"</p>\n<p>If public health alarm bells could somehow hit a higher pitch, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7312a2.htm?s_cid=mm7312a2_w\">a study published Thursday from researchers in China</a> would certainly accomplish it. The study surveyed gonorrhea bacterial isolates—<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>—from around the country and found that the prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant isolates nearly tripled between 2017 and 2021. Ceftriaxone-resistant strains made up roughly 8 percent of the nearly 3,000 bacterial isolates collected from gonorrhea infections in 2022. That's up from just under 3 percent in 2017. The study appears in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>\n<p>While those single-digit percentages may seem low, compared to other countries they're extremely high. In the US, for instance, the prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant strains <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/gisp-profiles/default.htm\">never went above 0.2 percent between 2017 and 2021</a>, according to the CDC. In Canada, ceftriaxone-resistance was stable at 0.6 percent between 2017 and 2021. The United Kingdom had a prevalence of 0.21 percent in 2022.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013217#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013217&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aa2137e85885c079a963962ce8b02af8329e019493b699b955370cc6b206623b","category":"Tech"}
