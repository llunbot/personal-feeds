In keeping with Liv’s design ethos, the Embolden E+ features <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-bikes-a-buyers-guide-to-find-what-you-need/\">women’s-specific geometry</a>.</p>\n<p>Both bikes feature 140mm of front suspension, with 125mm of rear suspension controlled by Giants FlexPoint suspension linkage.</p>\n<p>The bikes are now available, with the Giant Stance E+2 and Liv Embolden E+2 both starting at £3,499 / $4,400 / €3999.</p>\n<h2>Flex stay suspension and new linkage</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The system uses flex in the chainstays and seat stays, removing the need for a linkage in the rear triangle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Liv</i></span></div>\n<p>The bikes are built around a new 6061 aluminium alloy frame, using Giant’s single-pivot FlexPoint design.</p>\n<p>This is a single-pivot linkage-driven <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">suspension system</a>, which doesn’t require a pivot in the rear triangle. It instead uses the flex of the seat stays and chainstays to provide the articulation needed for the rear wheel to move.</p>\n<p>The system provides the bikes with 125mm of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">rear travel</a>, which is the same as on the previous Stance E+, but is a 5mm increase for the Embolden E+.</p>\n<p>An update to the linkage gives the bikes a sleeker-looking rear end compared to the previous models that featured a similar silhouette to Giant’s maestro linkage.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The FlexPoint removes the need for a second rocker arm found on the Maestro linkage, reducing complexity and weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Maestro linkage is Giants twin-link virtual pivot system, the brand says by moving away from it has saved weight as it eliminates the need for a rocker arm and two pivot points.</p>\n<p>Both bikes feature mounts for racks, mudguards, and a kickstand.</p>\n<p>The US will receive hybrid EX models that ship with accessories similar to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-turbo-tero-x/\">Specialized Terro X</a>, and are designed to cross the disciplines between a mountain bike and a utility bike – an SUV of sorts.</p>\n<h2>Giant Stance E+ geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Stance E+ features more aggressive geometry than before, with a head angle of 65.5 degrees.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<p>Giant says it wanted to add more confident handling characteristics to the Stance E+ and has paid more attention to the descending capabilities of the bike.</p>\n<p>The new Stance E+ features a significant reach increase of 29mm, up from 421mm to 450mm for a size medium.</p>\n<p>Reach determines the front centre of the bike – the longer it is, the less you feel that you’re going to go over the bars on steep terrain.</p>\n<p>This is matched with a slacker head angle of 65.5 degrees – a significant slackening from the 67-degree head angle on the previous model.</p>\n<p>The Stance E+ is only available in a 29in wheelsize.</p>\n<h2>Liv Embolden E+ geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Embolden features updated geometry, with slacker head angles and increased reach.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Liv</i></span></div>\n<p>The Embolden E+ features women-specific geometry and size-specific wheel sizing. This means that the size XS bikes feature a 27.5in wheel, while the S, M, and L frames are built around a 29in wheel.</p>\n<p>Liv says this gives riders greater control and optimises the bike for all sizes.</p>\n<p>Similarly to the Stance E+, the new Embolden E+ has a slacker geometry than the model it replaces, with the head angle slackening by 1.5 degrees from 67.5 to 66 degrees on the 29in bikes.</p>\n<p>Reach measurements have also increased, with a size M increasing from 410mm to 437mm.</p>\n<p>The previous Embolden E+ was only available in sizes XS, S, and M but the new bike caters to taller female riders with a size L. This features a 455mm reach.</p>\n<h2>More motor torque</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bikes use a new motor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<p>The bikes will use the updated SyncDrive Sport 2 motor, provided by Yamaha.</p>\n<p>The new motor has an increased torque output of 75nm, up by 5nm on the previous motor, and a 400 per cent maximum support ratio – meaning the motor can multiply your pedalling input up to four times.</p>\n<p>The models of the bikes feature the EnergyPak 625whr battery, with the more expensive E+ Pro models using the 800whr version.</p>\n<p>The UK will only receive the Embolden E+ Pro, which also features a SyncDrive Pro motor featuring 85nm of torque.</p>\n<p>There is also the option of adding a 250whr battery extender to both bikes.</p>\n<h2>Giant Stance E+ spec and price</h2>\n<h3>Giant Stance E+1</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Stance E+ 1 features Giant’s in-house Contact Switch dropper post.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox 35 Silver</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> SR Suntour Raidon R</li>\n<li><strong>Motor:</strong> SyncDrive Sport 75nm</li>\n<li><strong>Battery:</strong> EnergyPak 625Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano Deore</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Shimano BR-M420</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Minion DHF 2.50 (front), Maxxis Dissector 2.40 (rear)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,999 / $4,800 / €4,499</li>\n</ul><h3>Giant Stance E+ 2</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All bikes feature Maxxis rubber, with a Minion DHF on the front and Dissector at the rear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> SR Suntour XCR 34 LO-R</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> SR Suntour Raidon R</li>\n<li><strong>Motor:</strong> SyncDrive Sport 75nm</li>\n<li><strong>Battery:</strong> EnergyPak 625Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano Deore</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Tektro HD-M745</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Minion DHF 2.50 (front), Maxxis Dissector 2.40 (rear)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,499 / $4,400 / €3999</li>\n</ul><h3>Liv Embolden E+ Pro 1</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Embolden E+ 1 Pro features a Giant dropper post.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Liv</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox 35 Silver</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> SR Suntour Raidon R</li>\n<li><strong>Motor:</strong> SyncDrive Pro 85nm</li>\n<li><strong>Battery:</strong> EnergyPak 800Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano Deore</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Tektro HD-M745</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Minion DHF 2.50 (front), Maxxis Dissector 2.40 (rear)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,299</li>\n</ul><h3>Liv Embolden E+ 2</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Embolden E+2 features SR Suntour suspension at the front and rear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Liv</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> SR Suntour XCR 34 LO-R</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> SR Suntour Raidon R</li>\n<li><strong>Motor:</strong> SyncDrive Sport 75nm</li>\n<li><strong>Battery:</strong> EnergyPak 625Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano Deore</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Tektro HD-M745</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis Minion DHF 2.50 (front), Maxxis Dissector 2.40 (rear)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,499 / $4,400 / €3999</li>\n</ul>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e6fef0434fdd41fae116e16cf6c545d9b68f58fde4b7de080a7ebcc4b8e55eb5","category":"Cycling"}
