For the latter product, Amazon is offering a return of all-time low prices for both the 256GB and 512GB storage options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/oct-13-deal.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This is the second-best price that we've ever tracked on the accessory, but it's been about two months since we last saw the Apple Pencil down to under $100, so Amazon's deal today is a solid buy for those in the market for the device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1WWBJK\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$19 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the following iPads: iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Air (4th generation), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd, 4th, and 5th generations), and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st, 2nd, and 3rd generations). The accessory is in stock and ready to ship today, with the usual free two-day shipping for all Prime members.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>M1 Mac Mini</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nSecondly, Apple's 2020 M1 Mac mini is seeing a return of record low prices in both 256GB and 512GB capacities.
