               <p>Although Jonas Vingegaard has taken a commanding lead over Tadej Pogačar in the general classification battle at this year’s Tour de France, the race nevertheless looks set for a firework-filled dash to Paris.</p>\n<p>Having tackled the only <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time trial</a> in this year’s race on Tuesday, both the UAE-Team Emirates and Jumbo-Visma leaders are back on their team-issue road bikes for the rest of the race.</p>\n<p>As you’d expect, both have access to some of the latest and greatest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a> available, along with top-of-the-range components, wheels and tyres.</p>\n<p>Being on different teams, though, each with its own blend of sponsors, means both riders have a number of options to choose from.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, let’s take a look at the bikes of the two riders who have (so far) shaped this year’s race for the coveted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-jersey-colours/\">yellow jersey</a>.</p>\n<h2>Frameset | The luxury or tyranny of choice</h2>\n<h3>Jonas’ Vingegaard’s Cervélo S5 and R5</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jonas Vingegaard has access to a fleet of Cervélo road framesets, but has been riding the S5 (pictured here) and R5 at this year’s Tour.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Jumbo-Visma is sponsored by Cervélo, so Vingegaard has the luxury of choice when it comes to his frameset.</p>\n<p>The Dane started this year’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France</a> aboard a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cervelo-s5-force-etap-axs-review/\">Cervélo S5</a>, the Canadian brand’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bike</a>.</p>\n<p>The S5 is fully optimised for slicing through the wind, with deep truncated aerofoil tube shapes throughout, and an innovative V-shaped stem.</p>\n<p>There are even distinct echoes of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/the-new-cervelo-p5-is-a-well-refined-tt-and-triathlon-bike/\">Cervélo P5 time trial bike</a> in the S5’s design, underlining its focus on aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cervélo S5’s rear-wheel hugging seat tube is reminiscent of a time trial bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For stages in the high mountains, however, he’s also been using the Cervélo R5, the brand’s lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">climbing bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Although this bike still incorporates aero detailing (and Vingegaard pairs his with an aerodynamic, integrated handlebar, as we’ll discuss later), it’s far more traditional in its shaping.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

lighter, but less aerodynamic, Cervélo R5 for mountain stages.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joan Cros Garcia - Corbis/Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>There are no dropped seatstays, rear-wheel hugging seat tube or hinge fork here. Instead, everything is about low weight, high stiffness and performance on long climbs.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting Vingegaard and his teammates have access to yet more road framesets from Cervélo, beyond the S5 and R5.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cervélo S5 has a hinge fork design that extends the effective depth of the head tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s the aero-lightweight all-rounder <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-cervelo-soloist/\">Soloist</a>, for example, which Jumbo-Visma used at this year’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2023-paris-roubaix-tech-trends/\">Paris-Roubaix</a>.</p>\n<p>Said to be around 250g lighter than the S5, yet more aerodynamic than the R5, we had wondered if the Dutch team might use the Soloist at this year’s Tour for rolling stages. So far, though, it’s yet to make an appearance.</p>\n<p>Cervélo also has the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cervelo-caledonia-5-ultegra-di2/\">Caledonia</a> endurance road bike in its catalogue, although given the S5, R5 and Soloist share its 34mm tyre clearance, it’s no surprise to see the pros lean towards the racier options, even for cobbled classics.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jumbo-Visma team bikes were shod with special-edition graphics for the most important race of the year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Tadej Pogačar’s Colnago V4Rs</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogačar’s Colnago V4Rs is designed to be a Grand Tour specialist’s bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For Pogačar, the choice is simpler. Colnago only makes two dedicated road framesets – the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/colnago-v4rs-dura-ace-di2-review/\">aero all-rounder V4Rs</a> and the more <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/colnago-c68-dura-ace-review/\">classically styled C68</a>.</p>\n<p>Given the C68 makes next to no concession to aerodynamic efficiency – a key concern for any pro racing the Tour – it’s highly unlikely we’ll see it raced in anger at this year’s Tour (or any other, for that matter).</p>\n<p>The only exception might be if Pogačar takes to the streets of Paris aboard a custom-painted C68 – purely for the sake of marketing, considering the Tour’s final stage is a largely ceremonial affair for the general classification – should he reach the final stage in the race leader’s yellow jersey.</p>\n<p>Failing that, we expect Pogačar will race the V4Rs for every stage, as he has done so far.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The V4Rs’ dropped seatstays and lightweight aero tubing are typical of a modern all-rounder road bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The V4Rs was first unveiled as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/colnago-prototipo-frame/\">Colnago Prototipo</a> just before the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-2022-tech-trends/\">2022 Tour de France</a>, before eventually being <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/colnago-v4rs/\">officially launched in December that year</a>.</p>\n<p>Designed with input from Pogačar himself, the V4Rs is designed to be both aerodynamic and lightweight.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar philosophy to that used by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/egan-bernals-pinarello-dogma-f-has-mismatched-tyres-pro-only-bars-and-weighs-7-38kg/\">Ineos-Grenadiers’ Pinarello Dogma F</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-giant-propel/\">Jayco-Alula’s Giant Propel Advanced SL</a>.</p>\n<p>According to Colnago, the V4Rs is 3 per cent more aerodynamic than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/colnago-v3rs/\">V3Rs</a>, at an almost identical weight.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogačar’s Colnago V4Rs is equipped with a new ENVE one-piece cockpit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Pogačar’s bike may be even slippier, though, because he’s paired his with a new ENVE<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/tadej-pogacar-enve-handlebar-tour-de-france/\"> integrated handlebar</a> (which we’ll discuss in more detail later).</p>\n<p>Is there an element of compromise with a ‘one bike fits all’ approach? Perhaps, although this could also simply be what Pogačar prefers.</p>\n<p>Colnago has previously made dedicated aero road bikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/bike-frames/road-bike-frames/colnago-concept-first-ride-review/\">Colnago Concept</a>, so we’re sure it would be open to making another (plus a dedicated lightweight bike for mountain stages) if Pogačar or his team requested it.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's

title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jonas Vingegaard’s Cervélo S5 has a SRAM Red eTap AXS drivetrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">SRAM Red eTap AXS</a> drivetrain components.</p>\n<p>When we photographed one of his S5s prior to the race start in Bilbao, Spain, Vingegaard’s bike was equipped with a 2x drivetrain.</p>\n<p>This bike had 52/39t chainrings paired with a wide-ranging 10-33t cassette out back.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jonas Vingegaard was using

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-2023-tech-trends/\">2023 Tour de France tech trends</a> article, though, Vingegaard and a few other SRAM-sponsored riders have also been using <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a> at this year’s Tour for certain stages.</p>\n<p>Because they’re integrated into the chainrings at the Red and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/sram-force-axs-2023-review/\">Force AXS</a> level, it’s no surprise to see Vingegaard and the rest of his teammates employing SRAM Red AXS power meters (which use the same internals as the highly rated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/quarq-dfour-dub-power-meter-review/\">Quarq DFour DUB power meter</a>).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i>

shifters (albeit with custom ‘pro’ graphics that make the SRAM logos more prominent).</p>\n<p>According to a SRAM representative, Vingegaard prefers the new shape of the nominally second-tier Force AXS hoods, as well as the fact that they’re a little lighter than the Red-level ones.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's

<i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Pogačar’s upgraded Dura-Ace Di2 R9200</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogačar’s Colnago V4Rs has a Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200 drivetrain, with upgraded chainrings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With Pogačar’s team being sponsored by Shimano, it’s no surprise to see his bike equipped with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9200-review/\">Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200</a> groupset.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian road and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time trial</a> national champion (and current holder of the white jersey) has used a 2x setup for every stage in this year’s race, so far.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s because Shimano’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupsets</a> don’t officially support 1x use, or because Pogačar simply prefers a 2x setup, we’re not sure.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pogačar has used a 2x drivetrain for every stage, so far.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Pogačar has used <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-2020-time-trial-tech-gallery/\">1x for time trials at the Tour</a> in previous years, though, so it’s clearly something he’s open to under the right circumstances.</p>\n<p>Like most other Shimano-sponsored riders, Pogačar’s bike was equipped with 54/40t chainrings (which replaced the old 53/39t ‘standard’ double-chainring setup in Shimano’s latest Dura-Ace groupset), paired with an 11-34t cassette out back.</p>\n<p>Pogačar is also using Shimano’s latest Dura-Ace FC-R9200-P dual-sided power meter crankset.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogačar’s drivetrain has been upgraded with these CarbonTi chainrings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In a notable deviation from Shimano’s standard equipment, Pogačar’s bike is equipped with CarbonTi X-CarboRing EVO carbon chainrings.</p>\n<p>With claimed weights of 114g for the 54t and 47g for the 40t, these chainrings are presumably slightly lighter than stock Dura-Ace versions (we’re not sure how much, unfortunately, as Shimano doesn’t offer weights for these chainrings on its website).</p>\n<p>CarbonTi is listed as an ‘official supplier’ of Pogačar’s team, which is handy because this upgrade would otherwise cost well over €400 per set.</p>\n<h2>Wheels and tyres | Divergent philosophies</h2>\n<h3>Vingegaard’s many options</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jonas Vingegaard’s Cervélo S5 was equipped with lightweight wheels and tyres at the Grand Départ.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As with his frameset and drivetrain, Vingegaard has also been swapping between different wheel and tyre setups depending on the varying demands of each stage.</p>\n<p>As discussed in our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-tyre-tech/\">Tour tyre tech deep dive</a>, Vingegaard’s bike was equipped with unusually narrow 24c Vittoria Corsa Pro tubular tyres on a Reserve 34|37 wheelset at this year’s Grand Départ.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These 24.4mm Vittoria Corsa Pro tubular tyres were the narrowest tyres we saw at this year’s race.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kai Eves / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Throughout the race, though, Vingegaard has also used tubeless setups based on Reserve’s 40|44 wheelset and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/vittoria-corsa-pro-tlr-first-ride-review/\">Corsa Pro TLR</a> or Vittoria Corsa Speed G2.0 TLR tyres (Vittoria’s time trial-specific model).</p>\n<p>What’s more, we spotted Vingegaard was using Corsa Pro Speed TLR tyres in yesterday’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trial</a> – a model which has yet to be officially released.</p>\n<div>\n    <img

25mm internal width of the ENVE rims, these 28c tyres balloon up to 31.3mm-wide at the front, and 32.2mm-wide at the rear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar Tour de

unreleased one-piece handlebar</a>, instead of the stock Colnago option.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear what the performance advantage would be compared to Colnago’s integrated bar, but ENVE confirmed the handlebar has been designed around Pogačar’s requirements and isn’t an off-the-shelf piece of tech.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej

Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>At a glance, the integrated handlebar appears to combine ENVE’s existing Aero Road stem and its flared Aero Handlebar.</p>\n<p>Although it can be tricky to tell with integrated setups, Pogačar’s stem appeared to be around 120 to 130mm long, and was paired with a 36cm-wide handlebar (again, measured centre to centre at the brake hoods).</p>\n<p>Pogačar also has Di2 sprint shifters positioned to enable him to shift with his thumbs when holding the drops.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\"

front and rear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The CarbonTi brake rotors save a little weight, but cost a lot of money (though it’s unlikely Pogačar and his team are paying for them).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These have a claimed weight of 98 and 86g each, and cost €220 per rotor.</p>\n<p>Compared to the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/poc-propel-aero-sunglasses/\">Dura-Ace RT-CL900 rotors</a>, that saves just 23g per set, so it’s a truly marginal gain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img

seatpost, which looks suspiciously like those made by Darimo.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Pog’s seatpost also appeared to be a non-standard affair.</p>\n<p>With an unpainted, unidirectional carbon finish, it bears a strong resemblance to the ultra-light carbon seatposts made by Spanish brand Darimo.</p>\n<p>Of course, it might also just be a standard team-issue post with the paint stripped off to save a few grams.</p>\n<p>Either way, it’s clear Pogačar (or someone on his team) has sweated the fine details for the two-time Tour winner’s bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pogačar has a

and 2021.</p>\n<p>As you’d expect, it has carbon rails to keep things light, and a claimed weight of 180g.</p>\n<p>Pogačar uses Shimano’s flagship Dura-Ace PD-R9100 pedals – one of the most popular pedals in the peloton.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej

bike has a CeramicSpeed bottom bracket (which is presumably fitted with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bearings</a>) and a set of Elite Leggero Carbon bottle cages.</p>\n<p>When we saw Pogačar’s bike at the Grand Départ, it wasn’t equipped with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a>, but the team is sponsored by Wahoo and Pogačar appears to favour the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/cycle-computers/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-v2-review/\">Elemnt Bolt</a>.</p>\n<h2>Weight | Lightweight bikes for lightweight riders</h2>\n<h3>Vingegaard’s flyweight aero bike</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\"
