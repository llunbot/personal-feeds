You have until May 31 to take advantage of this promotion, so be sure to browse <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2F%3Fref%3DnaviMenu\">Anker's best products on its website</a> before the end of the month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's also worth noting that Anker is still hosting its Mother's Day sale, and some of the discounts in that event are steeper than our 20 percent sitewide discount. Be sure to check and compare both discounts in your cart before you place your order to ensure you have the best deal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Portable Chargers</h2>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1664-maggo-10000mah-power-bank%3Fvariant%3D44058070548630%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale\">MagGo 10,000 mAh Power Bank</a> - $60.00, down from $74.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1336-20000mah-power-bank%3Fvariant%3D42691854925974%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale\">Prime 20,000 mAh Power Bank</a> - $104.00, down from $129.99</li></ul>\r<br />\n<h2>Wall Chargers</h2>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa2669-3-port-wall-charger%3Fvariant%3D42691852435606%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale\">67W 3-Port Wall Charger</a> - $48.00, down from $59.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa2697-anker-charger-140w-4-port%3Fvariant%3D44320558055574%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale\">140W 4-Port Charger with USB-C Cable</a> - $80.00, down from $99.99</li></ul>\r<br />\n<h2>Charging Stations</h2>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25m8-maggo-qi2-wireless-charging-station-magsafe-compatible%3Fvariant%3D44057193316502%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale\">MagGo 3-in-1 Foldable Charging Station</a> - $72.00, down from $89.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25m3-maggo-qi2-wireless-charging-station-magsafe-compatible%3Fvariant%3D43028936032406%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale\">MagGo 3-in-1 Charging Stand</a> - $79.99, down from $110.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fy1811%3Fvariant%3D42206465327254%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale\">3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe</a> - $104.00, down from $129.99</li></ul>\r<br />\n<h2>Hubs</h2>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fbundle-a2683141-1-a88e2012-1%3Fvariant%3D44036908220566%26ref%3D2025bfcm_discount_zone\">200W 6-Port Prime Charger with USB-C Cable</a> - $83.20, down from $103.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa2345-anker-prime-charger-250w-6-ports-ganprime%3Fcov%3Db%26ref%3Dearth-day-sale%26variant%3D43931956478102\">250W 6-Port Prime Charger</a> - $136.00, down from $169.99</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're on the hunt for more discounts, be sure to visit our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a> roundup where we recap the best Apple-related bargains of the past week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<hr />\r<br />\n<div>\r<br />\n<h3>Deals Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nInterested in hearing more about the best deals you can find in 2025? <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/itTnTk\">Sign up</a> for our Deals Newsletter and we'll keep you updated so you don't miss the biggest deals of the season!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><div></div><div></div></div>\r<br />\n</div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/anker-offers-macrumors-readers-20-off/\">Anker Offers MacRumors Readers 20% Off Collection of Chargers, Hubs, Batteries, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anker-offers-macrumors-readers-20-off-collection-of-chargers-hubs-batteries-and-more.2456927/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b21f1098ebda843a6ab81917462058fd731f63b50049d56b233a764ab8f4e16","category":"Apple"}
