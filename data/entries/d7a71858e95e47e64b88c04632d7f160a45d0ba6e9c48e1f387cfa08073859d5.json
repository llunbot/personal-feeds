Log your rides in their app, and you earn 1 Imatra Coin for every 25km. Then you can spend those coins for real products from almost 100 top cycling brands. Brands you actually want to buy stuff from. Most of the deals available give you significant 10-20% discounts, where you’ll pay the balance in real money. But there’s also gear that is entirely paid with the virtual currency you earn by riding, like a pair of Alba Optics special edition Delta Ultra sunglasses that are free after riding almost 4500km…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Imatra Coin: Earn virtual currency with every kilometer ridden</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view.jpg\" alt=\"Imatra Coin earn virtual digital currency when you ride your bike, app view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_app-view-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imatra_sports_innovation/\" target=\"_blank\">Imatra</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Imatra is a pretty simple concept. Ride your bike. Earn virtual coins. Spend those coins to buy real gear for free. Or use them to get significant discounts off big-ticket cycling purchases from top brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve seen several ride-tracking platforms over the years that said they’d pay you based on how much distance you uploaded or synced to their network. But they never really seemed that worthwhile. At best giving you a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/200km-pas-normal-studios-midsummer-challenge-discount-code/\" target=\"_blank\">discount</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/w3-ride-app-pays-users/\" target=\"_blank\">limited gift card</a> at some online retailer. At worst earning some dodgy cryptocurrency or NFT. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Imatra seems a bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community.jpg\" alt=\"Imatra Coin earn virtual digital currency when you ride your bike, community\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_build-a-community-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They say, “<em>The aim of using the app is to develop a good habit, geared towards a healthy lifestyle, by promoting exercise and the outdoors.</em>” But, it’s still not entirely clear how they are monetizing your activity to justify giving you gear or deals. Obviously, you are giving them data. But what are they using it for? I guess we’ll need to read the T&amp;Cs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android.jpg\" alt=\"Imatra Coin earn virtual digital currency when you ride your bike, mobile app for iphone or android\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_smartphone-app-iOS-or-Android-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Imatra is a free mobile ride tracking app – for Android or iOS. Download it on your smartphone. Record your ride directly in the app. And it will convert your pedal power into Imatra’s “100% green native digital currency”. Use these Imatra Coins to buy select premium cycling gear, or pair the coins with real-world euros to buy more expensive bikes, cycling clothing, and everyday bike gear at a discount. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note: Imatra is based in Italy, and when I look at the site I see EUR€ prices and delivery estimates for Italy &amp; the EU. But Imatra says they are already set up in 31 countries , and their digital Imatra Coins are “without territorial borders”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_Alba-Optics.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_Alba-Optics.jpg\" alt=\"Imatra Coin earn virtual digital currency when you ride your bike, limited edition Abla sunglasses\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_Alba-Optics.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_Alba-Optics-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_Alba-Optics-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_Alba-Optics-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_Alba-Optics-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all quite new, just a few years running, so far. But Imatra’s marketplace has a pretty impressive list of desirable cycling brands. That includes the likes of: 3T, Assos, BMC, Campagnolo, CeramicSpeed, Classified, Colnago, Garmin, Lightweight, Look, Oakley, Pinarello, SCOR, Shimano, Wahoo, and many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, Imatra says their platform will also allow users to trade or sell digital coins amongst themselves, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much can you earn?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid.jpg\" alt=\"Imatra Coin earn virtual digital currency when you ride your bike, get paid to pedal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_get-paid-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Imatra says you will earn 1 Imatra Coin for every “25 normalized kilometers traveled”. The idea there, is that their algorithm calculates ‘normalized’ distance, based not only on how far you ride, but also how much you climb. So 25 flat Dutch kms won’t be worth the same as those 28 switchbacks of the <a href=\"https://climbfinder.com/en/climbs/passe-dello-stelvio\" target=\"_blank\">Passo Stelvio</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency.jpg\" alt=\"Imatra Coin earn virtual digital currency when you ride your bike, virtual currency\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Imatra-Coin-earn-virtual-digital-currency-when-you-ride-your-bike_virtual-currency-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, each Imatra Coin is valued at between €0.50 and €4.00, but it depends on which product you are putting it towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you aren’t gonna ride yourself to a free bike with Imatra. At that rate, I might earn as little as 250€ a year riding. But you may also land some pretty solid discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia.jpg\" alt=\"2023 3T Exploro Italia gravel bikes get fully internal cable routing, made-in-Italy, new lightweight RaceMax\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-3T-Exploro-Italia-gravel-bike-fully-internal-cable-routing_made-in-Italy_new-lightweight-RaceMax-Italia-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those savings shouldn’t be counted out entirely.
