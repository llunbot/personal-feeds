And yet, \"an increasing number of people in the US are now declining vaccination for a variety of reasons, ranging from safety concerns to religious beliefs,\" thanks to the rise of anti-vaccine misinformation spread on social media and elsewhere on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year found that, for the third consecutive year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/protective-vaccination-rates-falling-out-of-reach-in-us-exemptions-hit-record/\">vaccination rates among kindergartners had continued to slip</a>, with rates of non-medical vaccination exemptions rising to an all-time high. There are now 10 states with vaccination exemption rates over 5 percent, meaning that even if clinicians and health officials manage to vaccinate all non-exempt children, the state will not be able to reach the target of 95 percent coverage needed to curb the spread of disease on a population level.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995211#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995211&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b08113d8ad4a2070f48865e848926e3117ef8235dc5765c162d5c84893468dcb","category":"Tech"}
