{"title":"Might Meta Go Pay-Only in the EU?","link":"https://mobiledevmemo.com/the-edpb-invalidates-metas-use-of-pay-or-okay-what-next/","date":1713564655000,"content":"\n<p>Eric Seufert, writing at Mobile Dev Memo, spitballing how Meta might respond if the EU accepts the recommendation from the EDPB that their “Pay or OK” model is illegal:</p>\n\n<p><em>Charge a nominal fee for the ad-supported versions of Facebook and Instagram</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meta could introduce a small fee to use the ad-supported versions \nof Facebook and Instagram, rendering them as completely paid \nproducts in the EU. By eliminating its free tier, Meta should \ntheoretically sidestep the conditions proposed in the EDPB’s \nopinion, since the elimination of a free tier supported by \npersonalized advertising renders the Pay or Okay restrictions \nirrelevant. </p>\n\n<p>As frequent MDM Podcast <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/a-deep-dive-on-the-digital-markets-act-dma-and-digital-services-act-dsa/\">guest</a> Mikołaj Barczentewicz \npoints out in <a href=\"https://barczentewicz.substack.com/p/netflix-disney-and-meta-whats-an\">this blog post</a>, both Netflix and Disney+ \ntarget ads behaviorally in their <em>paid</em>, ad-supported tiers. Meta \ncould point to these products as examples of this pricing model \nbeing invoked: all options are paid, but the cheapest option is \nsubsidized by behaviorally-supported ads. Of course, the EDPB has \ngiven itself latitude with its definition of “large online \nplatform” to only litigate specific instances of commercial \nstrategy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn’t think of this when I spitballed my own ideas for how Meta might respond. Maybe they offer two tiers: €1/month with targeted ads, or €6/month without ads. Maybe they even make the fee for the ad tier truly nominal, say €1/<em>year</em>? The problem with this might be that too few people are willing to pay anything at all for social networking. Because it’s always been free-of-charge, people (not unreasonably!) now think it ought to forever remain free-of-charge.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the “just exit the EU” option, Seufert writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don’t believe that Meta will respond by exiting the EU market \naltogether — at least not in the near term. Per above: the EU is \n10% of (what I understand to be) Facebook’s global advertising \nrevenue, and GDPR fines aren’t as significant as those incurred \nunder the DMA. The maximum fine under the <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/fines/\">GDPR</a> is 4% of \nannual worldwide turnover, whereas the maximum fine under the \n<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2349\">DMA</a> is 20% of annual worldwide turnover. While I do \nbelieve the EU regulatory regime’s intransigence will influence a \nscaled, US-domiciled tech company to exit the EU market in the \nmedium term, my sense is that Meta won’t take that course of \naction in immediate response to this decision. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That 10 percent figure is big but not indispensable. And it’s not much bigger than <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue\">Apple’s 7 percent figure</a> for App Store revenue from the EU. The EU is indeed a big and important market, but it’s <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/more_on_the_eus_market_might\">nowhere near as big or important as the European Commissioners think</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/19/meta-pay-only-eu\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"70f93a7b66e2c3cbc68f63c6073f448589b8cac2ebc3a7ede00320a1394a71a9","category":"Tech"}
