Considered for years as the best video \ncapture application for mobile devices, the team behind Filmic Pro \nand presumably Filmic Firstlight — the company’s photo-focused \napp — has been let go. [...] </p>\n\n<p>It is unclear what Bending Spoons intends to do with Filmic Pro or \nFilmic Firstlight, but there were early signs of trouble when the \ncompany’s most <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2022/12/09/filmic-pro-v7-brings-new-features-and-a-redesigned-camera-interface/\">recent major update was last year</a>. The most \nrecent notable update to Filmic Pro came in October which brought \nsupport for Apple Log into the app, but there was no mention of \nthe addition of external SSD support, odd considering that Filmic \nPro had a strong track record for updating its platform to work \nwith all of the new iPhone updates — especially those that are \nparticularly important for video. </p>\n\n<p>In Filmic’s absence, Blackmagic Design’s iOS app has become the \nmost popular way to capture footage with the new iPhones and was \n<a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2023/10/31/apple-shot-its-scary-fast-event-entirely-on-the-iphone-15-pro-max/\">used by Apple’s in-house team</a> for the production of its \nMac event on October 31. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@film_girl/post/C0W2qTrr8Q1/\">Christina Warren, on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hate this but I’m sadly not at all surprised. Filmic has an \nincredible product they were afraid to charge for and when they \nfinally changed pricing models, it was too little too late and \nusers rebelled. If they had been charging $100 a year or even \nupfront in 2015, I think they could have survived without selling \nto the Bending Spoons vultures. But now they’ve got a subscription \napp that isn’t actively improving and free competition from Black \nMagic who uses their apps as loss leaders. Hate it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Filmic was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/search?q=filmic\">featured by Apple</a> in numerous iPhone keynotes and App Store promotions over the years — for a long stretch it was undeniably the premier “pro” video camera app for iPhones.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/filmic-staff-laid-off\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"23f621f427f3420baf4ecaa51ac09be3510e00a4a03d00e813ad24dd7a9037f3","category":"Tech"}
