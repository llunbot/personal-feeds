Norwegian scientists might have the answer: field peas, as well as beans and lentils. According to a <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.4c06748\">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, experimental beers made with the sugars found in these foods had similar flavor profiles to your average Belgian-style sour beer, yet the brewing process was shorter with simpler steps.</p>\n<p>“Sour beer is the beer enthusiast’s alternative to champagne,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1072068?\">said co-author Bjørge Westereng</a> of the Norwegian University of Life Science. \"By using sugars derived from peas that yeast cannot metabolize, we promote the growth of bacteria essential for producing sour beer.”</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/the-chemistry-of-what-makes-sour-beer-so-sour/\">previously</a> reported, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_beer\">sour beer</a> has been around for centuries and has become a favorite with craft brewers in recent years, although the brewing process can be both unpredictable and time-consuming. Brewers of standard beer carefully control the strains of yeast they use, taking care to ensure other microbes don't sneak into the mix, lest they alter the flavor during fermentation.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/pea-sugars-can-speed-up-sour-beer-brewing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/pea-sugars-can-speed-up-sour-beer-brewing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d557e84beb28d0c3a3d2b1b32fa0d9c4b3c8ffc95017716f4bcadc8e7de964c3","category":"Tech"}
