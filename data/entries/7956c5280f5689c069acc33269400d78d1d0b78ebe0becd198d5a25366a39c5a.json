RetroArch could be sideloaded onto iOS and tvOS before this, but only using <a href=\"https://docs.libretro.com/guides/install-ios/\">awkward workarounds</a> that took a lot more work and know-how than downloading an app from the App Store.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025043#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025043&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7956c5280f5689c069acc33269400d78d1d0b78ebe0becd198d5a25366a39c5a","category":"Tech"}
