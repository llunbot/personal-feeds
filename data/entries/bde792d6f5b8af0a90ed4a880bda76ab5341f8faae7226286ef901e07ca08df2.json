Musk provided the answer of \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438748063527575555\">next month</a>\" in response to a Twitter user who asked when Starlink will come out of beta.</p>\n<p>SpaceX began sending email invitations to Starlink's public beta <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/spacex-starlink-public-beta-begins-its-99-a-month-plus-500-up-front/\">in October 2020</a>.

The company has been taking preorders for post-beta service and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/04/spacex-over-500000-orders-for-starlink-satellite-internet-service.html\">said in May</a> that \"over half a million people have placed an order or put down a deposit for Starlink.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796340#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796340&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bde792d6f5b8af0a90ed4a880bda76ab5341f8faae7226286ef901e07ca08df2","category":"Tech"}
