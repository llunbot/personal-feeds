The event is set to start at 10:00 a.m.,\nand select members of the media have been invited to attend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looking at my notes, I don’t think Apple’s ever before held a September iPhone event on a Monday. Sometimes Wednesdays, but usually Tuesdays. <strong>Update:</strong> The first (and currently the only scheduled) debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is on Tuesday 10 September — I’ll bet Apple set this one for Monday to give them a better chance at leading the news during the 24 hours after the event.</p>\n\n<p>As for the theme, “glowtime” seems pretty obviously a reference to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/30/this-is-the-new-siri-with-apple-intelligence-in-ios-181-beta-1/\">the new Siri-with-Apple-Intelligence interface</a> in iOS 18.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/26/apple-event-glowtime\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"af2f2c4c899d2d5cc87a9a4d7872de9f47c730651bb0e913feaf755224772108","category":"Tech"}
