But if your Mac is older than five years old, you probably won’t be able to run it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple ended support for a lot of older Macs with the update to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/782634/macos-ventura-compatibility.html\">macOS Ventura</a>, and with Sonoma, a few of the 2017 models are on the chopping block. Find out the latest version of macOS your Mac can run in our separate <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS compatibility guide</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac’s that run macOS Sonoma</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the Macs on which you’ll be able to run macOS Sonoma.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iMac</strong> from 2019 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Pro</strong> from 2019 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iMac Pro</strong> from 2017</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Studio</strong> from 2022 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MacBook Air</strong> from 2018 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac mini</strong> from 2018 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MacBook Pro</strong> from 2018 and later</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The list is very similar to that for macOS Ventura, but while that version supported iMacs and MacBooks from 2017, only the iMac Pro from that year is supported by macOS Sonoma. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">how to install macOS Sonoma. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma features that require newer Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the list of Macs supported by macOS Sonoma extends back five years, a few features require newer hardware. The Presenter Overlay video conferencing feature requires a Mac with Apple Silicon. Hand reactions require using either the built-in camera on a Mac with Apple Silicon, or any Mac when using Continuity Camera with an iPhone 12 or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macs that won’t run macOS Sonoma</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura supported the following Macs that macOS Sonoma doesn’t: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iMac 2017</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook models from 2017</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Pro models from 2017</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is likely to continue to support these Macs in the form of security <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678251/macos-13-ventura-features-compatibility-download-install.html\">updates to Ventura</a> for a little while longer. The company usually provides support for the past three versions of the Mac operating system. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html\">How long does Apple support Macs?</a> That would indicate that these Macs will lose support in the next two or so years though, so it would be wise to update them before that time.  </p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1b04b9756e946fd7c97b78c013e214d684a368a4aded5b5e206287b8674d3ace","category":"Apple"}
