{"title":"M1 vs. M2 vs. M3 vs. M4 MacBook Pro Buyer's Guide: 30+ Differences Compared","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-upgraders-buyers-guide/","date":1730480040000,"content":"Apple this week refreshed the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> with its latest Apple silicon chips, but what exactly do the latest machines bring to the table and is it worth upgrading from the previous generations?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-MacBook-Pros-Thumb.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe 14-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ with the M4 chip starts at $1,599, replacing the previous M3 model as the entry-level machine in Apple's pro notebook lineup. Equipped with the higher-end M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, the 14-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ starts at $1,999 and the 16-inch model starts at $2,499.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUpon the launch of the latest models, previous-generation ‌MacBook Pro‌ models have been discontinued and are no longer available from Apple's main storefront. Units of slightly older machines such as the 2023 models may, however, still be available via Apple's refurbished store and third-party retailers for significantly reduced prices. Buying a second-hand model is also an option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFirst-time ‌MacBook Pro‌‌ customers or those upgrading from a much older device may be wondering whether it is worth buying a 2021 or 2023, so it will be important to weigh up exactly what was added with the latest version. Likewise, existing users of the 2021 or 2023 MacBook Pros may be wondering if it is worth upgrading to the latest model or sticking with their current device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSee the detailed breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with the late 2024's ‌14- and 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ models compared to their predecessors:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br

predecessors, offering more new features and capabilities than either of the 2023 refreshes, including Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, a 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage and Desk View, and a nano-texture display option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe late 2023 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models are relatively minor improvements over their direct predecessors that primarily focus on performance improvements. Beyond their chips, the early 2023 ‌MacBook Pro‌ introduced support for Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1, and added an extra hour of battery life. The late 2023 ‌MacBook Pro‌ added an extra 100 nits of SDR brightness, AV1 decode, and a Space Black color option. Accumulatively, this made for quite a small upgrade for existing users of the 2021 ‌MacBook Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChoosing which 14- or 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ model to buy ultimately comes down to what level of performance you require. For example, the M4 series of chips feature a significantly more powerful Neural Engine, which may be an attractive upgrade for some users, but it is far from essential for the vast majority. Generally, unless you need peak performance for demanding professional workflows, it will not be worth upgrading from a 2023 ‌MacBook Pro‌ to a 2024 model, or from an early 2023 machine to a late 2023 model. Only those who need absolute peak performance with the M4 Max chip will really benefit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those who have not yet made the leap to an Apple silicon machine, the 2023 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models are still very good options if you can get them for a significantly lower price. It is only worth paying more to get the latest model if you want a future-proof device to keep for the long term, where better performance, Thunderbolt 5, battery life, and AI capabilities are likely to be more beneficial through successive software updates and as connectivity needs with other devices evolve. Even then, it is difficult to recommend buying a late 2024 ‌MacBook Pro‌ at full price over an equivalent, heavily discounted 2023 model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 14-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ with the M4 chip effectively replaces the previous 13- and 14-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌, which featured the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip in 2020 and the M3 chip in 2023, adding 16GB of memory as standard, longer battery life, and an additional Thunderbolt port. For users of older ‌MacBook Pro‌ models, the new low-cost 14-inch model represents a relatively significant upgrade. Given the improvements to Apple silicon over recent years, with redesigned GPUs, improved connectivity and external display support, and more, some ‌M1 Pro‌ and ‌M1 Max‌ ‌MacBook Pro‌ users may be considering an upgrade. While the ‌M1‌ ‌MacBook Pro‌ models are still highly capable machines, there are now just enough accumulative upgrades with the latest models that some users may find upgrading worthwhile.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-upgraders-buyers-guide/\">M1 vs. M2 vs. M3 vs. M4 MacBook Pro Buyer's Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-vs-m2-vs-m3-vs-m4-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2377515/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"047fe8735640e47144ab5a3de0972b4f829f51de6ea54f40aba4bc7fb21f6fd9","category":"Apple"}
