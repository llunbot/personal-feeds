But if you are a cycling fan and are in town for the Games (or any time after really), you should consider taking a break from the action to visit some of the quiet corners of the city’s cycling culture found around town. Here are just five of <em>Rouleur</em>’s favourite bike spots in Paris.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Ludo the Bicycling Bouquiniste</h3>\n<p><em>Les Bouquinistes</em>, or booksellers, along the River Seine are nothing short of a local landmark, and an indelible part of the city’s DNA. Dating back to the 17th century, <em>les bouquinistes </em>have long been a part of the intellectual life of the Left Bank,<span> </span>as their trademark green stalls fold open and close every day, giving the Seine the reputation as the only river that runs between two bookshelves.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ludo04_ludo_bouquaniste_2020_1_of_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1721897102\" /></div>\n<p><em>Ludo Communier at his cycling-themed book stall on the River Seine.</em></p>\n<p>For the past eight years Ludo Communier has devoted his own book stall to cycling memorabilia. An avid cyclist himself, Communier possesses a wealth of vintage cycling magazines, books, and posters, a portion of which are on display daily.</p>\n<p>Here you can spend hours leafing through old copies of Miroir du Cyclisme, books and vintage photos. The book stall could not be more centrally located, as it is at the foot of the <em>Pont des Arts</em> footbridge and just in front of the <em>Institute de France.</em> Stop on by, you will almost certainly walk away with a souvenir of French cycling history.</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> 23 Quai Conti, 75006, Paris<br /> <strong>Hours:</strong> Daily from 11am to 7pm (closed Wednesday)</p>\n<h3>Cycles Laurent</h3>\n<p>Founded in 1948 on the outskirts of Paris by former professional Marcel Laurent, a two-time winner of Bordeaux-Paris, Cycles Laurent is one of the oldest bike shops in the city. Located in the shadows of the Place de la République since 1977, Cycles Laurent carries a variety of bike brands, but it is impossible to walk through the doors here, and not have a sense of history.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Cycles_Laurent00_Rouleur_07_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1721897313\" /></div>\n<p><em>Marcel Laurent's Derney is still proudly displayed inside Cycles Laurent.</em></p>\n<p>Marcel Laurent’s Bordeaux-Paris derny hangs above a window next to a prototype for Miguel Indurain’s Hour Record bike. And just about everywhere are vintage jerseys and photos.</p>\n<p>“We have literally hundreds of jerseys,” says Cédric Laurent, who manages the store today. “So many bike shops today are almost clinical in feel. For us it is important to keep with warmth and feel of the family shop.”</p>\n<p>But while Cycles Laurent has built their reputation on their vintage collection, modern cyclists can satisfy their needs with a variety of performance bikes from Bianchi, to Pinarello, to Lapierre. “It is really important for us to be offer a wide selection to our clients,” Cédric insists.</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> 9 Boulevard Voltaire, 75011, Paris<br /><strong>Hours:</strong> 10am to 6:45pm, Tuesday-Saturday</p>\n<h3>Steel Cyclewear and Coffeeshop</h3>\n<p>The first cycling café and clothing store in Paris, Steel Cyclewear and Coffeeshop has earned a reputation as the hip hangout for the modern-day cyclist. It’s not particularly centrally located as it sits on the eastern side of the Right Bank, but it is easily accessible for cyclists, as they ride in or out of town.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/steel01_Rouleur_07_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1721897024\" /></div>\n<p><em>Steel cycling café and shop is a modern Mecca to cycling culture in Paris.</em></p>\n<p>“We’ve been around for almost a decade, and we just keep growing,” says the shop manager Julien Sommier. “It’s crazy how much cycling has developed in Paris. We got the idea from our travels around the world, and we said that we had to have place in Paris where cyclists could meet. In the beginning the café took up most of the space, but today the showroom is really expanding.”</p>\n<p>Featuring high-profile clothing brands like Maap, Café du Cycliste, Poc or Rapha, today’s cyclist will feel right at home. But if you are not in the mood to shop, you can simply stop by for a coffee and watch a stage of the Tour de France, or in the upcoming Paris Olympics, one of the time trials or road races.</p>\n<p><strong>Location</strong>: 58 Rue de la Fontaine, 75011, Paris<br /><strong>Hours:</strong> 10am to 7pm, Tuesday-Saturday</p>\n<h3>Kilomètre 0: Le camp de base du cycliste</h3>\n<p>A unique take on a modern bike shop, KM 0: Base Camp for Cyclists is an elegant bike shop situated in the shadows of the Champs Élysées and the Arc de Triomphe<em>. </em>The large storefront windows and hardwood floors highlight the elegant showroom, while the upstairs is an indoor training centre, designed to allow cyclists a chance to avoid the city's often interminable grey and wet winters.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Kilometre_0_Rouleur_07_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1721897046\" /></div>\n<p><em>KM 0 specialises in high-end gear for all cyclists.</em></p>\n<p>Created in 2017, KM 0 specialises in high-end brands like Cervélo, Cannondale, Colnago, Assos or Poc.
