The iPhone, iPad and even Watch were all originally conceived under Apple’s co- founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is obviously true the first two were conceived under Jobs. But was the Watch? The Financial Times doesn’t cite any sources for that assertion, but the first reference to the idea the Macalope can find is from December 2011. Two months after Jobs’ death, four months after he resigned as CEO and 10 months after he’d taken a medical leave of absence, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/wearing-your-computer-on-your-sleeve/&amp;xcust=1-1-1656366-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">The New York Times claimed</a> a “very small group of Apple employees” were working on a wearable device that would connect to your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So… maybe. But even if it was “conceived” under Jobs, which seems to be a pretty big stretch, it was entirely brought to market under Tim Cook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It must be fun to be Tim Cook and to release the Watch and have everyone crow that the first product released under your tenure is a “flop” and then eight years later after it’s clear it was actually a hit people start saying “Oh, yeah, that was all Steve Jobs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poor guy can’t win! Other than having a lot of money.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Apple’s growth during Cook’s tenure has been spectacular, growing its market capitalisation from around $350bn in 2011 to around $2.4tn today. But despite the twin hit launches of Apple Watch in 2015 and AirPods a year later…</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, yeah! AirPods! Were AirPods also conceived under Steve Jobs? Did Jobs leave a pad of paper that he’d filled with random ideas so he could be credited with whatever Apple came up with for the rest of eternity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Crank-powered MacBooks.

When the Watch debuted, most analysts cut their expectations from bananapants down to simply bananashorts. As The Financial Times shows, the Watch Series 0 ended up selling about 18 million units over the 17 months it was available. A solid start, but not enough to shake the general consensus it was a “flop’ until sales continued to grow steadily year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the fact that Apple’s headset is expected to cost somewhere around $3,000 compared to the Watch’s initial starting price of $349, maybe even 1 million units isn’t realistic, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the breathless implications that Tim Cook should be polishing his resume if this headset doesn’t sell like virtual hotcakes on day one, the Macalope isn’t terribly worried. We’ve been hearing <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/224915/apples-missing-out-on-x.html\">since before the Watch was released</a> that Apple was “missing out” on AR and VR because its competitors were <em>already shipping!</em> Uh, devices that were basically prototypes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it a big launch for Cook and Apple? Sure. Is it gonna make or break the company or Cook’s legacy? More than the Touch Bar, less than the fact he’s already made Apple a $2.4 trillion company.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9901d4fefdae6bd6606a55cc3363b692b89a83c014bcdaebc212dfe842c35668","category":"Apple"}
