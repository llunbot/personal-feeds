A Corsa Pro Speed Wide Rim tyre is due to be launched later in the year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>A more aero profile</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"825\" height=\"503\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Vittoria-Wide-Rim-tyre-profile.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Vittoria-Wide-Rim-tyre-profile.jpg 825w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Vittoria-Wide-Rim-tyre-profile-300x183.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Vittoria-Wide-Rim-tyre-profile-768x468.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Vittoria-Wide-Rim-tyre-profile-750x457.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>Vittoria </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheel aerodynamics has progressed significantly in the last few years and wider rims, designed to fit tyres of 28mm and wider are now common in the highest performance <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-wheels\">road bike wheels</a>. But there are further aero gains from optimising the wheel and tyre as a system and avoiding a lightbulb-shaped profile to the tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A flatter interface between the wheel rim and the tyre sidewall can improve the airflow and it’s that which Vittoria’s new Wide Rim 29mm tyres are designed to promote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why 29mm? Because that’s the minimum width for compatibility with 25mm internal width rims recommended by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\">ETRTO</a>, which sets wheel and tyre standards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vittoria says that the combination of its 29mm tyre with a 25mm internal width rim offers the smoothest tyre to wheel transition and hence the least turbulence at the interface. It claims that this can save up to 5 watts at 55km/h relative to a Corsa Pro 28mm tyre on a standard 19-21mm width rim. The flatter sided profile also increases cornering grip, it says. Both gains are claimed for the Corsa N.Ext and Corsa Pro Speed too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vittoria notes that you can still use the Wide Rim tyres on rims narrower than 25mm, although this will reduce the tyre width. All the Wide Rim tyres are compatible with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">hookless rims</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-1-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/corsa-pro-wide-rim_casing-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Vittoria</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the tyre’s formula hasn’t changed, with the Corsa Pro Wide Rim having the same 320 TPI cotton casing and graphene plus silica tread compound that’s electrically vulcanised. The tyre also has Vittoria’s anti-puncture belt under the tread and Bead Shield, designed to protect the tyre bead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsa Pro Wide Rim tyre comes with tan sidewalls and Vittoria says it’s made in a carbon-neutral factory. It claims a 290g weight for the tyre, which is priced at £89.99 / €95.95 / $106.99.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n
