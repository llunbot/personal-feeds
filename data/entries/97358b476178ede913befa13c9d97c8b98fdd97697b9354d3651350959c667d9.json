Castillo has reinstated a citizen draft for the ongoing cultivation of Viviro, a homegrown wonder drug that cures cancer. Made by fertilizing Yara's tobacco crops with a chemical gas, this magic medicine is the key, the president declares, to lifting his broken-down island into the upper echelons of the world economic stage.</p>\n<p>But this is <em>Far Cry</em>, well-known for its love of open-world war games, destabilized nation-states, and crackpot despots. And Castillo, played with gusto by Giancarlo Esposito (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/10/breaking-bad-continues-to-amaze-but-moves-away-from-macguyver-like-core/\"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>), is certainly a tyrant. The truth we're shown during his address—of citizens being shipped off to the fields as forced slave labor or gunned down for resisting—is a non-revelation given the series' touchstones.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802221#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802221&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"97358b476178ede913befa13c9d97c8b98fdd97697b9354d3651350959c667d9","category":"Tech"}
