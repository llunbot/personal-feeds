This year’s edition will be the 114th, over a distance of 294km and take place on Saturday 18th March.</p>\n<p>The 2023 Milan-San Remo will depart from a new start line in Abbiategrasso, around 22km southwest of Milan, before rejoining the usual course 30km later into Pavia and travelling south towards the coast. The peloton will once again tackle the Tre Capi (Capo Mele, Capo Cervo and Capo Berta) in the final section of the race, followed by the Cipressa and Poggio di San Remo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/milan-san-remo-2022-photos\" target=\"_blank\">Last year’s edition</a> was won by Matej Mohorič – and sparked the <em>Great <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dropper-post-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Dropper Post Discourse</a></em> of 2022 – as his pre-planned attack on the Poggio’s descent worked flawlessly to deliver the Bahrain Victorious rider to a solo victory ahead of Anthony Turgis (TotalEnergies) and Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/from-the-archive-in-conversation-with-eddy-merckx\" target=\"_blank\">Eddy Merckx</a> is the most successful rider, winning Milan-San Remo seven times. A women’s race was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/womens-milan-san-remo\" target=\"_blank\">previously said to be in the works</a> for 2023, but this has not come to fruition (despite no word on why not and whether it is still part of the plan).</p>\n<p>A stacked peloton of contenders should take to the start line in 2023 as this is the Monument absolutely anyone could win.</p>\n<h2>How to watch and live stream Milan-San Remo 2023</h2>\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"milan-sanremo-cauld-15\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005739/milan-sanremo-cauld-15.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Matej Mohorič is all smiles after a memorable victory in 2022</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<p>As usual, Milan-San Remo will be shown live on UK television by Eurosport while also being available on several online player services.</p>\n<p>GCN+ has the rights to broadcast Milan-San Remo worldwide, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, but <a href=\"https://help.globalcyclingnetwork.com/hc/en-gb/sections/360004434020-Race-pass-race-schedules-per-country\" target=\"_blank\">double-check</a> to avoid disappointment.
