Even during the Android portion of Google's big I/O keynote, Google <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNfINi5CNbY&amp;t=5285s\">spent most of its time</a> showing off a new generative AI feature that creates wallpapers for you, as if there aren't enough wallpapers in the world.</p>\n<p>Last year's Android 13 release felt small, but that was because it was the <em>second</em> major Android OS release that year. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/tablet-focused-android-12l-update-rolls-out-just-not-to-any-tablets/\">Android 12L</a>—the big tablet and foldable release—came out earlier. What's Android 14's excuse? We're not really sure. We still have a few things to go over, though, like new lock screen customizations, genuinely exciting changes to the way the back button works, and a pile of under-the-hood changes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954547#p3\">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954547&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d0cf4543eb07a8c6e65c333e4e5e3e95f675078fb9f28724bcd472bd5d16e8d","category":"Tech"}
