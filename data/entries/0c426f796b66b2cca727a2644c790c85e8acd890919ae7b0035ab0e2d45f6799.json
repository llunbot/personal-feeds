He embodies the unpretentious spirit of the YouTube channel he founded in early 2019. He’ll speak with the exact same enthusiasm about the titanium Binary Maniak 29+ frame he helped design, as he will about the updates on the Trek Roscoe or his daughter’s Woom balance bike. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1RTjHmW7nA\" target=\"_blank\">he just posted a video on his channel</a> that, despite somehow showcasing that same unflappable positivity, is very very different…</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Binary-Maniak-HP.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Steve has been diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS). In his video, he speaks with remarkable candor about what the disease is, how he came to learn he had it, and how he expects to cope with it.

One pointed omission from the video is any sort of Gofundme link.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/SedonaMTB-60.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Because Steve isn’t planning on going away any time soon, he’ll still be producing content with Hardtail party.
