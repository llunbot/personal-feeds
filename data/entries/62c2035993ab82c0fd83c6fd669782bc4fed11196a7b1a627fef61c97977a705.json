This Berry Military fabric is *PFAS free (all DWR is PFAS), so no harmful chemicals will run off in your wash. These are made locally, about 19 miles from Rivendell’s warehouse. For the pants, from the knees up, they’re cut like Dickies because that’s what Will likes to ride in normally. Below the knees, they’re tapered to avoid chainring interference. The shorts also got a PFAS-free fabric treatment.</p>\n<p><em>*Starting as soon as Rivendell realized all of this, and affecting all MUSA clothing made for the 2025 season and onward, no more PFAS. The big fabric supplier, Milliken, has been, as they put it, “PFAS-free since ’23.” </em></p>\n<p>It’s still not as green as organic cotton or hemp or linen, but this is a step toward that, and at least a pair of our MUSA bottoms will likely last 10+ years. That’s something.</p>\n<p>See more on the new MUSA <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/musa-pants-2025-black\" target=\"_blank\">pants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/musa-shorts-2025-grey\" target=\"_blank\">shorts</a> Rivendell.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rivendells-musa-pants-and-shorts-2025/\">Rivendell’s MUSA Pants and Shorts Updated for 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"62c2035993ab82c0fd83c6fd669782bc4fed11196a7b1a627fef61c97977a705","category":"Cycling"}
