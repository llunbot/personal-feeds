The public benefit company, which has just under 40 full-time staff, has been busy building out its moderation features and achieving better stability during is closed beta period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers who install the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199\">Bluesky Social app</a> or visit <a href=\"https://bsky.app\">bsky.app</a> will be able to sign up and join the conversation platform, which should look familiar to users of the old Twitter â€“ a feed to which people can post messages up to 300 characters long as well as photos and video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe difference with Bluesky is that its servers use a decentralized Authenticated Transport (AT) Protocol that will allow users to opt-in to a microblogging experience that isn't run by the company, allowing them to create an account under a given domain name and then use their profile in rival apps that use the same network.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother advantage of the AT protocol is that it can operate based more on a user's preferences than algorithmically driven content, with user-curated feeds that people can use to find other users or topics, with customizable moderation tools also available to them. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAT will rival ActivityPub, the decentralized protocol powering Mastodon, and soon, Meta's Threads enabling interoperability between the two platforms. Later this month, Bluesky will also begin allowing outside developers to host their own servers on the AT Protocol and create their own rules.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24062837/bluesky-drops-invite-system-begins-federation-at-protocol\">The Verge</a></em>, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber said Bluesky's profit stream will eventually include charging users for additional features in its app, as well as taking a commission on purchases like custom feeds that developers will be able to sell as digital products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Bluesky Social app is a free download for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> [<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199\">Direct Link</a>].<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bluesky/\">Bluesky</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/bluesky-ends-closed-beta-period/\">Bluesky Social Network Ditches Invite Codes, Opens Registrations to All</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluesky-social-network-ditches-invite-codes-opens-registrations-to-all.2418762/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a89b77a040f90f9aa566d17512b026e2547a2ce164a1e9ba8b907473d284a6a","category":"Apple"}
