We talked about our Amazon Web Services setup, which is primarily built around <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/\">ECS containers</a> being spun up as needed to handle web traffic, and we walked through the ways that all of our hosting services hook together and function as a whole.</p>\n<p>This week, we shift our focus to a different layer in the stack—the applications we run on those services and how <em>they</em> work in the cloud. Those applications, after all, are what you come to the site for; you’re not here to marvel at a smoothly functioning infrastructure but rather to <em>actually read the site.</em> (I mean, I’m guessing that’s why you come here. It’s either that or everyone is showing up hoping I’m going to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/the-internet-demanded-partially-scientific-testing-of-ultraeverdry-in-hd/\">pour ketchup on myself and launch myself down a Slip-'N-Slide</a>, but that was a one-time thing I did a long time ago when I was young and needed the money.)</p>\n<h2>How traditional WordPress hosting works</h2>\n<p>Although I am, at best, a casual sysadmin, having hung up my pro spurs a decade and change ago, I do have some relevant practical experience hosting WordPress. I’m currently the volunteer admin for a half-dozen WordPress sites, including Houston-area weather forecast destination <a href=\"https://spacecityweather.com/\">Space City Weather </a>(along with its Spanish-language counterpart <a href=\"https://es.spacecityweather.com/\">Tiempo Ciudad Espacial</a>), the Atlantic hurricane-focused blog <a href=\"https://theeyewall.com/\">The Eyewall</a>, my <a href=\"https://blog.bigdinosaur.org/\">personal blog,</a> and a few other odds and ends.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954925#p3\">Read 55 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954925&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4ec8d68d19464a68f331ba9e7c97683b241c4fd76725de66ac287d5ea4ca3c6","category":"Tech"}
