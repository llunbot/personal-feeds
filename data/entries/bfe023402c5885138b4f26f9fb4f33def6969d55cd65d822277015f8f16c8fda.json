A separate alert from the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, alleged Apple cooperated with the NSA in the campaign. An Apple representative denied the claim.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943622#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943622&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bfe023402c5885138b4f26f9fb4f33def6969d55cd65d822277015f8f16c8fda","category":"Tech"}
