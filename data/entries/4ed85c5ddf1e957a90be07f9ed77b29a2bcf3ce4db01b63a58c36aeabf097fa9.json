{"title":"Here's When You Can Download macOS Monterey","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/23/when-to-download-macos-monterey/","date":1635015600000,"content":"Apple's official public release of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> is set to occur <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macos-monterey-on-october-25/\">on Monday, October 25</a>, just a few days after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/macos-monterey-release-candidate-2/\">released the second release candidate</a> to developers and a week after its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/everything-apple-announced-october-18-event/\">\"Unleashed\" media event</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/macOS-Monterey-on-MBP-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDevelopers are busy putting the finishing touches on their apps to take advantage of new features in ‌macOS Monterey‌ and support the new MacBook Pro models with Apple's new high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Pro and ‌M1‌ Max chips and a notched display, and many users will be looking to update their Macs as soon as Monterey is available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Apple has not shared an exact time for the release of ‌macOS Monterey‌, we can make some educated guesses based on Apple's localized sites for various countries and past releases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Apple lists the release date as October 25 in much of the world, localized sites for some countries in the Eastern Hemisphere list the launch date as October 26, as the launch time will come at or after midnight in those countries.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNotably, Apple lists a release date of October 25 <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/in/macos/monterey/\">on its Indian site</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/th/macos/monterey/\">its Thai site</a> lists an October 26 release date.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven that those two countries are 90 minutes apart by time zones, that pins things down relatively closely, pointing to a window <strong>between 8:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time</strong>. The most likely release time in that window would be 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is a common release time for Apple. A release at that time would correspond to 10:30 p.m. on October 25 in India and midnight on October 26 in Thailand. This same method has accurately predicted the release times for a number of major operating system updates from Apple, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumors/status/1326947476247441408\">including macOS Big Sur last year</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's worth noting that Apple's release times do sometimes vary a bit and it can take a bit of time for the updates to propagate across Apple's servers and become available to all users, so the 10:00 a.m. estimate is simply that – an estimate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macos-monterey-release-date/\">also indicated</a> that it will be releasing iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, watchOS 8.1, tvOS 15.1, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> software 15.1 during the week of October 25, but the company does not appear to have specified an exact day for those releases. There are some cross-platform features that means it would be logical for Apple to release all of its updates at the same time, but we'll have to wait and see what Apple's plans are.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are of course no guarantees Apple will stick to its usual release timing with ‌macOS Monterey‌, but given our best guess of 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time release, here's a breakdown of what that corresponds to in other time zones in the United States and around the world:\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li>Honolulu, Hawaii -- 7:00 a.m. HST</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Anchorage, Alaska -- 9:00 a.m. AKDT</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Cupertino, California -- 10:00 a.m. PDT</strong></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Vancouver, Canada -- 10:00 a.m. PDT</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Phoenix, Arizona -- 10:00 a.m. MST</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Denver, Colorado -- 11:00 a.m. MDT</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Chicago, Illinois -- 12:00 noon.
