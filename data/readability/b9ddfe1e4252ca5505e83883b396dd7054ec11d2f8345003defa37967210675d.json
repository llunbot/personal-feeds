Esker Cycles, which was co-founded by industry veteran Tim Krueger and uses Dave Weagle’s Orion suspension system for their full-susser mountain bikes, is now giving you the opportunity to own shares in their company.</p><p>Through an equity crowdfunding campaign on StartEngine, you’re able to buy in with as little as a $231 investment, with rewards starting at $500 investments. Besides owning a piece of the brands, perks range from 5% discounts on bikes up to bigger discounts on up to one bike per year, meetups and events with the founders, and more.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Aiu-N3cJC8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>With the bike industry currently seeing record growth and record supply chain issues, we’ve seen some major acquisitions lately – <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-buys-time-road-mountain-bike-pedals-to-their-line-up-with-new-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SRAM buying Time Pedals</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/parent-company-of-ktm-husqvarna-pierer-mobility-ag-acquires-felt-bicycles-enters-u-s-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KTM buying Felt</a>, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cervelo-santa-cruz-cannondale-gt-schwinn-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PON buying Cannondale</a>.</p><p>Esker’s move should give them the capital to continue growing without selling out completely. But, should they hit their targets, does position them as a future acquisition candidate.

When it came time to take our company to the next stage, it simply made sense to offer it to everyone through equity crowdfunding.” Said CEO Tim Krueger</p><p>Since its founding, Esker has been primarily self-funded, and is extremely proud of what they have accomplished, but they are ready for the next stage of growth. Heading into 2022 Esker has new bike models to bring to market, and will be increasing inventory on their existing lineup in order to keep up with the incredible demand of online customers, and to open up new dealers in areas that they have not been able to supply.</p><p>“Esker has a desirable product, a passionate customer base, a forward-thinking business model, and an exciting roadmap for the future. We are thrilled to be able to offer a piece of our growing company to everyone that wants to be a part of this journey with us.” Said Marketing Director Ryan Krueger.</p><p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.startengine.com/esker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Esker’s StartEngine campaign</a> for more details.
