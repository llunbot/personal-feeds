But there are some areas of cognition in which <i>homo sapiens</i> and other primates are not unmatched. What other animal’s brain could possibly operate at a human’s level, at least when it comes to one function? Birds—again.</p>\n<p>This is far from the first time that bird species such as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/for-the-first-time-research-reveals-crows-use-statistical-logic/\">corvids</a> and parrots have shown that they can think like us in certain ways. Jackdaws are clever corvids that belong to the same family as crows and ravens. After putting a pair of them to the test, an international team of researchers saw that the birds’ <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/12/researchers-store-working-memory-in-brain-slices/\">working memory</a> operates the same way as that of humans and higher primates. All of these species use what’s termed “attractor dynamics,” where they organize information into specific categories.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them, that means they also make the same mistakes we do. \"Jackdaws (<i>Corvus monedula</i>) have similar behavioral biases as humans; memories are less precise and more biased as memory demands increase,” the researchers said in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05442-5\">study</a> recently published in Communications Biology.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992736#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992736&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b0d1a83731ba701ac0d060c4bf3ab0a4f32035e698efacf1ca606524808ebc44","category":"Tech"}
