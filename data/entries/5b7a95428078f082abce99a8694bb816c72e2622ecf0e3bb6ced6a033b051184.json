Note that items can only be found if they are not in range of their owner's device, up to 50 meters.<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Find My</strong> app on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap the <strong>Items</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Drag the items card further up onto the screen using the small pill-shaped handle to reveal more options.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap <strong>Items That Can Track Me</strong>.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/find-my-items-that-track-me1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>Tap the <strong>Search</strong> button.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Look at the list titled \"Items Detected Near You.\" If a device is discovered, tap it for more information.\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>If it's an AirTag, you can tap <strong>Play Sound</strong> to more exactly locate it.

To prevent stalking with ‌‌AirTags‌‌ and other devices, Apple has implemented several safety measures.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌‌AirTags‌‌ are designed to start playing a sound between eight and 24 hours after being separated from their owner, and ‌iPhone‌ users are alerted if an AirTag is traveling with them. Apple is also working on an Android app that will let Android users detect an unknown AirTag or ‌‌Find My‌‌ network-enabled item to prevent ‌‌AirTags‌‌ from being used to stalk Android users.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-find-items-that-can-track-you/\">iOS 15.2 Beta: How to Use Find My to Locate Items That Can Track You</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-2-beta-how-to-use-find-my-to-locate-items-that-can-track-you.2323046/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qUyXo8QurM4:Ym2-0C3LyCs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qUyXo8QurM4:Ym2-0C3LyCs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5b7a95428078f082abce99a8694bb816c72e2622ecf0e3bb6ced6a033b051184","category":"Apple"}
