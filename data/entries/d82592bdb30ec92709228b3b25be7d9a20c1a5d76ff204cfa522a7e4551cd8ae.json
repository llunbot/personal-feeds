{"title":"Arm, Qualcomm Legal Battle Might Disrupt ‘AI PCs’","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/arm-qualcomm-legal-battle-seen-disrupting-ai-powered-pc-wave-2024-06-10/","date":1718220910000,"content":"\n<p>Max A. Cherney:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The British company, which is majority-owned by Japan’s SoftBank\nGroup sued Qualcomm in 2022 for failing to negotiate a new license\nafter it acquired a new company. The suit revolves around\ntechnology that Qualcomm, a designer of mobile chips, acquired\nfrom a business called Nuvia that was founded by Apple chip\nengineers and which it purchased in 2021 for $1.4 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Arm builds the intellectual property and designs that it sells to\ncompanies such as Apple and Qualcomm, which they use to make\nchips. Nuvia had plans to design server chips based on Arm\nlicenses, but after the acquisition closed, Qualcomm reassigned\nits remaining team to develop a laptop processor, which is now\nbeing used in Microsoft’s latest AI PC, called Copilot+.</p>\n\n<p>Arm said the current design planned for Microsoft’s Copilot+\nlaptops is a direct technical descendant of Nuvia’s chip. Arm said\nit had cancelled the license for these chips.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My initial reaction when I see reports of legal disputes like this is “Eh, they’ll settle.” But look at the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/masimo\">Apple-Masimo dispute</a> over blood oxygen sensors — that’s still dragging on as we head into summer.</p>\n\n<p>Also: Is there any company that Qualcomm hasn’t gotten into a knock-down, drag-out legal battle with over licensing or patent issues? It’s like, <em>of course</em> Qualcomm is trying to stiff Arm on licensing fees. That’s how Qualcomm rolls.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/12/arm-qualcomm\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d82592bdb30ec92709228b3b25be7d9a20c1a5d76ff204cfa522a7e4551cd8ae","category":"Tech"}
