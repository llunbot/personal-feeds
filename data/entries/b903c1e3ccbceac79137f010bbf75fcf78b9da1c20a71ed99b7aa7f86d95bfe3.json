But in an industry in which smaller or medium films tend to be squeezed out in favor of big-budget fare, there's a solid argument to be made that Netflix and others could help fill that niche. That certainly seems to be the case with Netflix's forthcoming sci-fi film, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceman_(2024_film)\"><em>Spaceman</em></a>, judging by the official trailer. Adam Sandler stars as an astronaut who is not coping well with the isolation and disintegration of his marriage while on an eight-month solo mission and strikes up a friendship with a friendly alien space spider who wants to help him work through his emotional distress. Honestly, Netflix had us at friendly alien space spider.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the 2017 novel below.)</strong></p>\n<p>Directed by Johan Renck (<em>Chernobyl</em>,<em> Breaking Bad</em>), the film is based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceman_of_Bohemia\">2017 novel</a>, <em>Spaceman of Bohemia</em>, by Jaroslav Kalfař. Kalfař <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5ITYZzWWzY\">has said</a> he was inspired to write his novel after a childhood experience of becoming briefly separated from his grandfather while on a nighttime walk through the woods. The \"perfect darkness, with nothing but the stars\" made a strong impression, as did the silence and sense of loneliness. <em>Spaceman of Bohemia</em> started as a short story about an astronaut stranded in orbit as his wife filed for divorce and eventually became a novel that incorporated not just the theme of loneliness, but also Kalfař's formative experiences growing up in the Czech Republic.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996263#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996263&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b903c1e3ccbceac79137f010bbf75fcf78b9da1c20a71ed99b7aa7f86d95bfe3","category":"Tech"}
