Contact Photos in Messages App</h3>\r<br />\niOS 18 adds contact photos next to names in the Messages app, making it easier to identify conversations at a glance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-1.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\nThe contact photos are also visible in Messages app notifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-4.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\n<h3>2. Silent Mode Settings</h3>\r<br />\nIn the Settings app, you can now choose to have Silent mode on your iPhone automatically turn on or off when the device is connected to CarPlay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-5.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\n<h3>3. Color Filters</h3>\r<br />\nApple has expanded Color Filters to CarPlay. This accessibility feature can help individuals with color blindness to differentiate colors on the CarPlay interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-3.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\nThere is a grayscale option and three other color filters available to choose from.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-2.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\n<h3>4. Voice Control</h3>\r<br />\nVoice Control is another new accessibility feature that allows you to control CarPlay entirely with Siri voice commands through a connected iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-7.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\n<h3>5. Sound Recognition</h3>\r<br />\nSound Recognition is expanding to CarPlay to provide notifications for driving-related sounds, such as car horns and sirens. This feature can be especially beneficial to drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg\" width=\"1306\" height=\"718\" />\r<br />\nWe did not see Sound Recognition in the CarPlay settings on iOS 18 beta 1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Update — June 14: Sports Score Card via Siri</h3>\r<br />\nWe found another feature after publishing: if you ask Siri for a sports score, it will now show a card on the CarPlay interface. This works for the NBA and NHL at a minimum.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/CarPlay-iOS-18-Sports-Siri.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2>\r<br />\nApple shared some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/\">updated next-generation CarPlay images</a> during WWDC 2024, revealing new Vehicle, Media, and Climate apps on the screen for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNext-generation CarPlay will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles. Apple revealed a variety of different design options and layouts that will be available to automakers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-2.jpeg\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nAutomakers will be able to show custom notifications on next-generation CarPlay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-WWDC-2024-Charging.jpg\" width=\"1576\" height=\"777\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/\">Apple's website</a> continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay will arrive in 2024, but it has yet to provide a more specific timeframe, and it did not provide any timing-related updates in its WWDC coding sessions.
