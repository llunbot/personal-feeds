{"title":"The Verge: ‘CarPlay Is Anticompetitive, Too, US Lawsuit Alleges’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107976/apple-carplay-doj-lawsuit-anticompetitive-digital-key","date":1711062908000,"content":"\n<p>Andrew J. Hawkins, reporting for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“By applying the same playbook of restrictions to CarPlay, \nApple further locks-in the power of the iPhone by preventing \nthe development of other disintermediating technologies that \ninteroperate with the phone but reside off device,” the \nlawsuit says. </p>\n\n<p>The inclusion of CarPlay, as well as digital key functions through \nApple’s Wallet feature, came as a surprise to some analysts, who \nsay that the DOJ may be misunderstanding the utility and functions \nof the phone-mirroring system. </p>\n\n<p>This is especially true for the next-generation version, which \nprosecutors described insidiously as taking “over all of the \nscreens, sensors, and gauges in a car, forcing users to experience \ndriving as an iPhone-centric experience if they want to use any of \nthe features provided by CarPlay.” </p>\n\n<p>That’s misleading, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at \nGuidehouse Insights and an expert on vehicle software. “Even with \nthe next-gen system, OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] \ndon’t actually have to let Apple take over all the screens,” he \nsaid in an email. “They can limit the interface to whichever \nscreens they want.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Misleading” is too kind. It’s just flat-out wrong. The biggest problem with CarPlay 2 is its relative dearth of adoption to date — previewed only by Porsche and Aston Martin, neither of which is even vaguely a mainstream brand.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/21/carplay-us-v-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ef06ecedca137e3badfbbce7bae1ed0d50cf478a48cc9ccb63117dac1849ac19","category":"Tech"}
