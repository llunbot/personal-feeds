We've had several reports from Vision Pro customers who have been asked to share their thoughts about the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nApple asks about Vision Pro satisfaction, environment usage, favorite features, what it's being used for, how often it's used, and how long usage sessions last. Apple also asks about guest mode and who else uses the Vision Pro, which is a curious question because it's not at all set up for multi-person usage. Some of the questions:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Overall, how satisfied are you with your Vision Pro?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What is your favorite feature or aspect of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> so far?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>How often do you use your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>For how long do you typically wear your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ before you decide to take it off?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Who else uses your Vision Pro?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Before taking the survey, did you know that you can let others use your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ with the Guest User feature?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Which of these activities do you do regularly on your Vision Pro? (with a long list of options)</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What types of video content are you most interested in watching on ‌Apple Vision Pro‌?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>When using your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌, how often are you immersed in an Environment?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Whenever you're using apps on ‌Apple Vision Pro‌, how often do you multitask?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Have you set up your Persona to use in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>How satisfied are you with how your Persona looks on ‌Apple Vision Pro‌?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Where is your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ used most?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Which of these accessories do you use with your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌? (with a list that includes mice, cases, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and more).</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What head band do you use most often with your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>How often do you use your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ while the battery is connected to a power source?</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThe survey is long and in-depth, and also goes into the other devices that each respondent owns.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe uptick in Vision Pro survey distribution comes as there have been reports about waning interest in the headset. Over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that customers aren't as curious about the Vision Pro, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/\">demand for demos</a> in retail stores \"way down.\" At some locations, demos and sales have dropped from a \"couple of units a day to just a handful in a whole week.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro headset owners have also reported a decrease in usage, picking it up just once or twice a week rather than on a daily basis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said on Tuesday that Apple is dropping the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-cuts-vision-pro-shipments/\">number of Apple Vision Pro units</a> that it plans to ship, and he said it is a sign that demand in the U.S. has \"fallen sharply beyond expectations.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo believes that Apple needs to address the lack of key applications, price, and comfort without impacting user experience in order for the Vision Pro to ultimately see success in the future.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-asks-customers-for-vision-pro-feedback/\">Apple Asks Customers for Vision Pro Feedback</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-asks-customers-for-vision-pro-feedback.2424990/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7dc42cfe9a0859af7ba9f24300c1e204c1b9b96c9b919d2e70ccfd22ac3fdf7f","category":"Apple"}
