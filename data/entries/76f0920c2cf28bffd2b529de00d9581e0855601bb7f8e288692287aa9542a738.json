The change affects both the on-console store and the Xbox 360 Marketplace website. Users will lose the ability to purchase games, movies and TV content, and avatars and other profile customizations.</p>\n<p>Users will still be able to download and play games they have already purchased for the foreseeable future after that date, and many other network features will continue to work, like communication with friends, cloud saves, and online play in multiplayer games whose developers still support it. Developers will still be able to issue patches and updates to Xbox 360 games, too. Backward-compatible Xbox 360 games will still be available for purchase on the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S stores, Microsoft says.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961603#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961603&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"76f0920c2cf28bffd2b529de00d9581e0855601bb7f8e288692287aa9542a738","category":"Tech"}
