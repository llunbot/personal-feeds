Today, we're going to introduce the concepts of simple variable substitution and loops—again, with a specific focus on the Bash command line itself, rather than Bash <em>scripting.</em></p>\n<p>If you need to write a script for repeated use—particularly one with significant logical branching and evaluation—I strongly recommend a \"real language\" instead of Bash. Luckily, there are plenty of options. I'm personally a big fan of Perl, in part because it's available on pretty much any *nix system you'll ever encounter. Others might reasonably choose, say, Python or Go instead, and I wouldn't judge.</p>\n<p>The real point is that we're focusing on the command line itself. Everything below is something you can easily learn to think in and use in real time with a little practice.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793704#p3\">Read 47 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793704&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"07ec9ecec2c4dd5c38db02d210db1529cdf8b5a8d70619b28fdf779b3fbd2cd2","category":"Tech"}
