Prime Video is bringing us a 10-episode series exploring Nemo's origin story, loosely based on the former, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_(TV_series)\"><em>Nautilus</em></a>, premiering in a couple of weeks. The official trailer just dropped, and it has all the swashbuckling, deep sea diving adventures, and exotic sea creatures one would expect from a classic Verne taleâ€”including that infamous giant squid and a plucky romantic interest for good measure.</p>\n<p><strong>(Minor spoilers for the novels below.)</strong></p>\n<p>In Verne's novels, Nemo is a mysterious figure also known as Prince Dakkar, who lost his kingdom and his family in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He devotes himself to science and builds an electrically powered submersible ship called the <em>Nautilus</em>, salvaging gold bullion from shipwrecks to fund his travels, occasionally coming to the aid of people in need (a pearl diver under a shark attack or castaways in need of rescue). He is well-read, has a Western education, and is fluent in several languages, as well as being a gifted engineer. And he appreciates the fine arts.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/nautilus-trailer-explores-captain-nemos-origins/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/nautilus-trailer-explores-captain-nemos-origins/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b2579e258987d1fe85b0078b6540d69cb15e2a891346813f75f73c280f78aae","category":"Tech"}
