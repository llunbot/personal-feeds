Using this feature, you can now build multi-region applications without adding complexity to your applications, with the same system architecture as if you were using a single AWS Region.</p> \n<p>S3 Multi-Region Access Points is built on top of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/\">AWS Global Accelerator</a> and routes <span>S3</span> requests over the global AWS network. S3 Multi-Region Access Points dynamically routes your requests to the lowest latency copy of your data, so the upload and download performance can increase by 60 percent. It’s a great solution for applications that rely on reading files from <span>S3</span> and also for applications like autonomous vehicles that need to write a lot of data to <span>S3</span>. To learn more about this new launch, read <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-multi-region-access-points-accelerate-performance-availability\">How to Accelerate Performance and Availability of Multi-Region Applications with Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/06/07/s3-multi-region-access-point-create-name.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/06/07/s3-multi-region-access-point-create-name-1024x458.png\" /></a></p> \n<p>There’s also great news about the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-intelligent-tiering-adds-archive-access-tiers/\">Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class!</a> The conditions of usage have been updated. There is no longer a minimum storage duration for all objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering, and monitoring and automation charges for objects smaller than 128 KB have been removed. Smaller objects (128 KB or less) are not eligible for auto-tiering when stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Now that there is no monitoring and automation charge for small objects and no minimum storage duration, you can use the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class by default for all your workloads with unknown or changing access patterns. To learn more about this announcement, read <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-intelligent-tiering-further-automating-cost-savings-for-short-lived-and-small-objects\">Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering – Improved Cost Optimizations for Short-Lived and Small Objects</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong><span>Amazon EFS</span><br /> </strong></span><span>Amazon EFS</span> Intelligent Tiering is a new capability that makes it easier to optimize costs for shared file storage when access patterns change. When you enable <span>Amazon EFS</span> Intelligent-Tiering, it will store the files in the appropriate storage class at the right time. For example, if you have a file that is not used for a period of time, EFS Intelligent-Tiering will move the file to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs/features/infrequent-access/\">Infrequent Access (IA) storage class</a>. If the file is accessed again, Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move it back to the Standard storage class.</p> \n<p>To get started with Intelligent-Tiering, enable lifecycle management in a new or existing file system and choose a lifecycle policy to automatically transition files between different storage classes. <span>Amazon EFS</span> Intelligent-Tiering is perfect for workloads with changing or unknown access patterns, such as machine learning inference and training, analytics, content management and media assets.

It provides customizable controls and parameters, like backup frequency or retention period. You can also audit your backups to see if they satisfy your organizational and regulatory requirements. If one of your monitored backups drifts from your predefined parameters, AWS Backup Audit Manager will let you know so you can take corrective action. This new feature also enables you to generate reports to share with auditors and regulators.

This was increased from 16 TB to 64 TB, allowing customers to create the largest snapshots and recover them to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ebs-io2-block-express-volumes-with-amazon-ec2-r5b-instances-are-now-generally-available/\">Amazon EBS io2 Block Express Volumes</a>.

Managed Workflows does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, like setting up the infrastructure to run your code upon file arrival, continuously monitoring for errors, and verifying that all the changes to the data are logged. Managed Workflows helps you handle error scenarios so that failsafe modes trigger when needed.</p> \n<p><span>AWS Transfer Family</span> Managed Workflows allows you to configure all the necessary tasks at once so that tasks can automatically run in the background. Managed Workflows is available today in the AWS Transfer Family Management Console.
