The new design centres around refined control ergonomics and reduced weight, making it <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/shimano-dura-ace-vs-sram-red-etap-axs\" target=\"_blank\">more competitive with Shimano’s Dura-Ace</a> in those regards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tied to the altered shape of the controls are claimed improvements in braking. SRAM says the new levers provide better modulation and require less effort for the same braking power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the chainset has been made a touch lighter, its changes are largely cosmetic and its chainrings and power meter stick to their one-piece arrangement. However, front shifting is said to be faster thanks to a thinner front derailleur cage and new auto-trim function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\" target=\"_blank\">Hammerhead’s new Karoo 3 head unit</a> launches at the same time as SRAM Red AXS, having been co-developed with the groupset for heightened integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another of SRAM’s brands, Zipp, gets in on the fun too, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zipp-vector-r-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">releasing new tyres and a new set of bars</a> designed to work the renovated Red levers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM Red AXS is available immediately as OE on bikes from over 40 brands and aftermarket too, with prices from £4,090 / €4,570 / £4,090.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclist has had the opportunity to test the new SRAM Red AXS groupset over the last few weeks, so be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">our full review</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS groupset review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\" target=\"_blank\">Hammerhead Karoo 3 has new internals and longer battery life</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zipp-vector-r-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">Zipp ups integration with SL 80 Race bar and Goodyear-made Vector R tyres</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Seeing the light</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"National Hill Climb Championship bike 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/focus_hill_climb_nationals_2023-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been to any hill climb event in the last ten years and taken stock of the bikes being raced, without a doubt you’ll have noticed that SRAM’s old Red22 mechanical rim brake groupset was the most common choice on the more committed builds. It wouldn’t have been for the groupset’s shifting and braking abilities – hill climbers don’t do much of either, and while Red22 was fine in those respects, it certainly wasn’t significantly better than Shimano’s Dura-Ace or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-super-record-ti-review\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo’s Super Record</a> of similar vintages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red22 was the preeminent choice because it was a damn sight lighter than both. Its 1,741g trumped Super Record by over 200g and Dura-Ace 9000 (incidentally, that groupset’s finest ever incarnation) by half that again. However, while subsequent redesigns of Red have undoubtedly increased its functionality, such as the inclusion of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">disc brakes</a>, wireless electronic shifting and an extra sprocket, they have also increased its weight, to the extent that an equivalent Dura-Ace arrangement has been lighter for a couple of generations now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the modern features that are now a prerequisite in groupset design we’ll never again get down to the dizzyingly light weights of old, but in a contemporary context SRAM says the latest Red revision takes back the lightest groupset mantle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Give by taking away</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-6.jpg 1667w\" /><figcaption>SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘While it’s dependent on exact setup, new Red AXS is 2,496g,’ says Jason Fowler, SRAM’s road drivetrain product manager. ‘That’s 153g lighter than the previous version, and around 66g lighter than similarly specced <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Dura-Ace</a>.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking closely at the more skeletal appearance of the new Red groupset, it’s easy to see where SRAM has made plenty of the incremental gains necessary to achieve that weight loss. Cutout chain links contribute 13g, the carriers at the centre of the new Paceline X rotors are more aggressively pared back, shoulder sections of the brake callipers have been removed and the outer plate of the rear derailleur’s parallelogram has been hollowed out (a feature that would no doubt appeal to the hill climbers that have unofficially done similar to their Red22 derailleurs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hidden in the tweaked carbon layup of the crank arms, SRAM found another 29g, but by far the biggest contributor to Red’s diet has been at the levers, which the brand says have dropped 41.5g each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That’s a considerable saving so high up the bike,’ says Fowler. ‘It becomes apparent in the swing weight when climbing on the hoods.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet it will be the revised ergonomics of the controls that will be more tangible to riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-7.jpg 1667w\" /><figcaption>SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We were happy with the shape of the last generation levers, and they’ve remained a success to this day – SRAM Red was used by all six Grand Tour winners last year – but we knew it was an area we could develop,’ says Fowler. ‘Ergonomics aren’t something you can really model on a computer though. Real rider feedback was essential, and it’s been a four-year process to update the controls’ shape.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most obviously, the pommel of the controls is much smaller. The length of the body is longer by around six millimetres too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is to makes them more comfortable to grip when riding on the hoods,’ says Fowler. ‘The smaller pommel fits in the hand more comfortably, and the longer body allows more space for finger wrap underneath.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was allowed by shifting the piston arrangement inside the control body. It has gone from a vertical pull-piston in the pommel, where squeezing the brake lever pulls the piston downward to compress the hydraulic fluid and actuate the brakes, to a horizontal push-piston inside the lever body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Rearranging things like this, as well as reshaping the brake levers themselves, also allowed us to manipulate braking modulation. The lever pivot could be much higher, creating more leverage. Along with moving where the brake calliper applies pressure to the rotor further outboard, for the same force it now takes 80% less effort to brake from the hoods and 33% less effort from the drops.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How and where the braking power is applied isn’t set in stone either, as the levers possess independent adjustment of reach (how far the brake levers sit away from the bars) and contact point (when in the lever travel the brakes engage). SRAM says there should be plenty of scope for both, too, because the shift paddles are now slimmer and longer, so there’s more free space between lever and bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shifting gears</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-11.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time SRAM updated Red, the groupset went to 12-speed. That introduced SRAM’s X-Range gearing concept, which uses a 10t smallest sprocket and more compact chainrings in an attempt to create both close steps and more range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The groupset also served as the starting point for three overhauled groupset tiers below it, as well as the extension of SRAM’s mix-and-match AXS concept into its road portfolio. It was a biggie, so while it would be fair to say this new SRAM Red AXS groupset’s weight and ergonomic changes validly grab headlines, ultimately it’s a simply a step on from the last generation’s step change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is reflected in the gearing this time round. While there are some cosmetic changes in the machined one-piece chainrings, they are offered in the same three pairings (46/33, 48/35, 50/37 , with three extra – 52/39, 54/41, 56/43 – available aftermarket) and SRAM continues with its integrated power meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I know we’ve taken flack for not making it separate to the rings, but the longer we’ve persevered with the design the more evident it has become that it’s simply not an issue. Our chainrings just don’t really wear out, so the return rate of consumed units has been incredibly low,’ says Fowler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New cassettes have been added though, with 10-30t and 10-36t options doubling the number of options offered next to the preexisting 10-28t and 10-33t, all using the one-piece machined steel X-DOME construction.
