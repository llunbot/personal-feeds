{"title":"Frances Haugen, Facebook Whistleblower, on 60 Minutes","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-60-minutes-polarizing-divisive-content/","date":1633356849000,"content":"\n<p>Keith Zubrow, writing for 60 Minutes Overtime:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Haugen stated that some of Facebook’s own research found that\n“angry content” is more likely to receive engagement, something\nthat content producers and political parties are aware of.</p>\n\n<p>“One of the most shocking pieces of information that I brought out\nof Facebook that I think is essential to this disclosure is\npolitical parties have been quoted, in Facebook’s own research,\nsaying, we know you changed how you pick out the content that goes\nin the home feed,” said Haugen. “And now if we don’t publish\nangry, hateful, polarizing, divisive content, crickets. We don’t\nget anything. And we don’t like this. We know our constituents\ndon’t like this. But if we don’t do these stories, we don’t get\ndistributed. And so it used to be that we did very little of it,\nand now we have to do a lot of it, because we have jobs to do. And\nif we don’t get traffic and engagement, we’ll lose our jobs.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Haugen’s whistleblowing jibes exactly with my theory all along: Facebook prioritizes growth and engagement over all else, and when they discovered that polarizing angering content drives engagement more than anything else, they let it fly. It’s that simple.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/04/haugen-facebook-60-minutes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"07b75640d72f17b9e5387f9a5f75d61f069d2bf1fd90e2e1f03f9835df374373","category":"Tech"}
