With the ‌iPhone 13‌, it used an enhanced iteration of the 5nm process. For the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, the report claims Apple and its chipmaking partner TSMC are looking to adopt a \"4nm\" process for the A16 Bionic, the likely name for the chip powering the next-generation ‌iPhone‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA smaller process reduces a chip's physical footprint and offers improved performance and enhanced energy efficiency. A <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-and-its-favorite-chipmaker-get-closer\">report yesterday</a> by <em>The Information</em> claimed that TSMC and Apple are facing technical challenges in producing a 3nm chip, possibly being a reason the ‌iPhone 14‌ will feature a \"4nm\" process instead.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSeparate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/4nm-chips-for-apple-silicon-macs/\">reports from earlier in the year</a> have suggested that Apple has booked all of TSMC's production capacity for the 3nm process, which could instead debut in the ‌iPhone‌ 15 and next-generation Apple silicon Mac computers in several years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the ‌iPhone 13‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> already released, we now await what Apple has in store for the ‌iPhone 14‌. While we're still a little under a year away from its launch, rumors suggest that the ‌iPhone 14‌ will feature one of the most significant ‌iPhone‌ redesigns of the past several years.
