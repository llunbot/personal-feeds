{"title":"Safari 15 Watch: Favorites Bar Edition","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/10/safari-15-watch-favorites-bar-edition/","date":1634311138000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And then macOS Monterey beta 10 dropped this week, and would you\nlook at this:</p>\n\n<p>Yep, that’s the Safari Favorites Bar, now located <em>above</em>\nthe tabs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple similarly moved the Favorites Bar above the tabs in Safari on iPadOS 15.1 beta 4, too.</p>\n\n<p>The full Bookmarks menu on iPad, alas, still remains hidden in the sidebar. That’s a weird one. In the initial WWDC previews, the Bookmarks toolbar button was removed in Safari on both iOS and iPadOS. In <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/18/ios-15-safari-beta-6\">the late summer redesign of Safari 15 for iOS</a>, the Bookmarks toolbar button (which you tap to access a hierarchical menu showing <em>all</em> your bookmarks, and which, crucially, remembers which folder you were in the next time you use it) was back where it belongs: in Safari’s bottom-of-the-screen toolbar.</p>\n\n<p>Yet on iPad — which has much more room for toolbar buttons than iPhone — Bookmarks are still squirreled away in the sidebar that is primarily intended for creating, managing, and switching between Tab Groups. Tab Groups are a clever and I think useful new feature. Bookmarks do not belong over there though. Worse, every time you use the Bookmarks menu over in the sidebar on iPadOS15, you have to navigate from the root level of your bookmarks each time. It doesn’t remember which folder you were in.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s to hoping that more changes to Safari 15 are coming, on both Mac and iPad.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/15/safari-15-favorites-bar\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2b70f6fb0597928a7403eb131bd8dba77aa86e39ae26d04322ff8040def529fe","category":"Tech"}
