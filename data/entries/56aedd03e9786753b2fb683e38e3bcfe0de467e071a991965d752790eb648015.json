The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ai-comes-for-your-pcs-keyboard-as-microsoft-adds-dedicated-copilot-key/\">Copilot key</a>, dedicated to launching Microsoft's eponymous generative AI assistant, is already on some Windows laptops released this year. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/windows-copilot-key-is-secretly-from-the-ibm-era-but-you-can-remap-it-with-the-right-tools\">Tom’s Hardware</a> dug into the new addition and determined exactly what pressing the button does, which is actually pretty simple. Pushing a computer's integrated Copilot button is like pressing left-Shift + Windows key + F23 simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Tom's Hardware confirmed this after wondering if the Copilot key introduced a new scan code to Windows or if it worked differently. Using the scripting program AuthoHotkey with a new laptop with a Copilot button, Tom's Hardware discovered the keystrokes registered when a user presses the Copilot key. The publication confirmed with Dell that “this key assignment is standard for the Copilot key and done at Microsoft's direction.”</p>\n<h2>F23</h2>\n<p>Surprising to see in that string of keys is F23. Having a computer keyboard with a function row or rows that take you from F1 all the way to F23 is quite rare today. When I try to imagine a keyboard that comes with an F23 button, vintage keyboards come to mind, more specifically <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-keyboards-mechanical-membrane-and-buckling-springs/6/#h1\">buckling spring keyboards</a> from IBM.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014584#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014584&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56aedd03e9786753b2fb683e38e3bcfe0de467e071a991965d752790eb648015","category":"Tech"}
