The collar is low cut and there’s protection behind the bottom of the zip to stop it from scuffing your flashy Rapha bib shorts – it recommends its Powerweave Bib Shorts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Pro Team Aero jersey has benefited from rider feedback from Rapha’s sponsored EF Pro Cycling teams, wind-tunnel testing and feedback from users of previous versions. The jersey was ridden to victory in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-2023-highlights\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix Femmes</a> in 2023 by Alison Jackson. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha says that its feedback has resulted in a redesign in particular of the sleeves and shoulders. These now use a fabric that Rapha calls Clima, which it says balances compression and stretch to eliminate drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features of the redesign highlighted by the pros include a close fit without bunching when riding tucked and the added elastic in the pockets to help keep all your stuff in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Pro Team Aero jersey is available in three colour combos for men and two for women. It’s priced at £185 / $245 / €210 / AU$300. RCC members can scoop one up today; the rest of us will have to wait until 6th March.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>And updated long sleeve and training jerseys</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-970x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/BEY01LS_CEI_Mens-Pro-Team-Long-Sleeve-Lightweight-Jersey_H124_mannequin_1.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Rapha </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Part of Rapha’s summer season Pro Team collection, the new Pro Aero jersey sits alongside the brand’s Pro Team Long Sleeve Lightweight jersey and the Pro Team Training jersey, both also redesigned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha says that the Pro Team Long Sleeve Lightweight jersey can be worn for training in temperatures between 6°C and 20°C and layered up for three-season versatility. It has an updated waist gripper and low-cut collar as well as a zipped pocket at the rear.
