{"title":"Apple Is No Longer Selling the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Folding Charger","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/12/apple-stops-selling-magsafe-battery-pack-magsafe-duo/","date":1694915919000,"content":"\n<p>Benjamin Mayo, 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although these accessories are technically obsoleted by today’s\nannouncements, you can still buy them on sites like Amazon\n(<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RrfmiA\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> and the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZkRKOh\">MagSafe Duo Charger</a>)\nwhile supplies last, if so desired.</p>\n\n<p>It’s unclear if Apple plans to introduce USB-C versions of these\naccessories in the future, or if these products have reached their\nnatural end-of-life anyway. It’s never quite clear how popular\nApple’s iPhone accessories are, after all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These were both great products. The MagSafe Battery Pack still might be something you’d want to buy, too — travel with one, and you can charge a new iPhone 15 using either a USB-C cable (plugged into the phone) <em>or</em> a Lightning cable (plugged into the battery pack). Either way, the other other device will get charged via the MagSafe connection too.</p>\n\n<p>Before the MagSafe Battery Pack, Apple sold a series of battery cases for some older iPhone generations. You remember them — <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/10/tim-cook-defends-apple-iphone-smart-battery-case-hump\">they looked a bit weird</a>, because the battery part was like a pregnant hump. Apple never once released a battery case at the same time the corresponding iPhones were announced. They’d announce the iPhones in September, then release the battery packs like two months later, without fanfare. I’ve always suspected this was deliberate — that Apple did not want to announce an external battery pack or case at the same time as new iPhones to avoid the possibility of even <em>some</em> of the news coverage for the new iPhones suggesting that they <em>need</em> an external battery pack because the built-in battery is insufficient.</p>\n\n<p>So, maybe Apple is simply done selling the MagSafe Battery Pack. But, even if they have a new USB-C version in the works, I’m not at all surprised that it wasn’t released last week. Let’s wait for November. I hope they do release one, because Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack is far better than the third-party ones I’ve tried (including two decent ones from Anker). Apple’s isn’t the biggest, but it’s the best because it’s the smartest. It negotiates intelligently with the iPhone when connected and doesn’t waste energy charging the iPhone past 80 percent or so. You can feel the difference in efficiency by heat alone. Third-party inductive battery packs get quite warm; Apple’s doesn’t. Also, the third-party ones seem to all be “magnetic”, not officially “MagSafe” — Apple’s sticks  better too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/16/magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo-charger\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a18824ecc90976ad588edecf1b6b856142d448de919bd7919338d9413efa45b2","category":"Tech"}
