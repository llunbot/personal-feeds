Last week, a site user advertised the sale of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/dell-warns-of-incident-that-may-have-leaked-customers-personal-info/\">Dell customer data</a> that was obtained from a support portal, forcing the computer maker to issue a vague warning to those affected. Also last week, Europol <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/europol-confirms-web-portal-breach-says-no-operational-data-stolen/\">confirmed to Bleeping Computer</a> that some of its data had been exposed in a breach of one of its portals. The data was put up for sale on BreachForums, Bleeping Computer reported.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the normal BreachForums front page was replaced with one that proclaimed: “This website has been taken down by the FBI and DOJ with assistance from international partners.” It went on to say agents are analyzing the backend data and invited those with information about the site to contact them. A graphic shown prominently at the top showed the forum profile images of the site's two administrators, Baphomet and ShinyHunters, positioned behind prison bars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024837#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024837&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2a1946049fd1a4ef064365f30a00cc815fb97a4a1e58bf5cea89d40f7933b3f","category":"Tech"}
