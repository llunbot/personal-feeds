Luxshare-ICT is the NPI supplier for Apple Watch 8 and the extreme sports versions.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman similarly said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/apple-watch-lineup-2022-se-model-rugged-model/\">Apple is planning to launch</a> the ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌, a new ‌Apple Watch SE‌ model, and a \"rugged\" model for sports.

All three Apple Watch models will launch in the second half of 2022, according to Kuo.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo's note also revealed information about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-to-launch-new-iphone-se-models-2022-2023/\">next two iPhone SE models</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/kuo-airpods-pro-late-2022-launch/\">second-generation AirPods Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/kuo-second-generation-apple-ar-headset/\">first two generations of Apple's mixed reality headset</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-8/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/rumored-apple-watch-lineup-for-2022/\">Rumored Apple Watch Lineup for 2022 to Include Three New Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumored-apple-watch-lineup-for-2022-to-include-three-new-models.2326660/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nN20yXkpHM0:tN9d_hXDJDI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nN20yXkpHM0:tN9d_hXDJDI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"47725bcff25977487b7272efa36d38f4ffdabe6f9441d427cc72c7c364e2611d","category":"Apple"}
