He insisted that the sexual assault that he described was entirely fabricated and declared, “I am not a rapist.”</p>\n<p>That clip came back to haunt Choe this month, when his performance in <em>Beef </em>drew wide praise, and journalists posted the clip to remind audiences of Choe’s past transgression. The clip quickly went viral on social media, and Choe seemingly decided to do damage control by sending copyright takedown notices through his non-profit, The David Young Choe Foundation, and successfully getting some of the clips removed from Twitter.</p>\n<p>“Several Twitter users—@MediumSizeMeech and @aurabogado have re-uploaded a clip from Episode 106 ‘Erection Quest’ of our DVDASA live podcast and video series that was originally published on March 10, 2014 without our consent,” the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aurabogado/status/1647745374378168320/photo/2\">takedown request read</a>, specifically noting that the request came directly from Choe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932755#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932755&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a895352f9f8030af2e9e3f21b315da315a67266a3e0c14472b31e72a51bcc8d2","category":"Tech"}
