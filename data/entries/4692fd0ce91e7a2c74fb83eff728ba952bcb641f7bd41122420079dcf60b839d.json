Clews, a qualified commissaire, founded the race in 2005 after travelling to international races and growing frustrated that those in Britain often lacked such a spectacle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, inspired by the Classics of northern France and Belgium, he set about creating a race across the lanes and farm tracks near his home in Rutland. His CiCLE Classic was an instant hit, and two years later was awarded UCI status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the years since, the CiCLE Classic has grown into Britain’s most important one-day race outside the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">National Championships</a>. This year, around 5,000 spectators braved heavy rain to cheer on the riders as they battled over the 11 off-road sectors that punctuate the 185km course. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-worlds-what-to-watch\">Glasgow World Champs: 9 weird and wonderful events you need to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Glasgow UCI Cycling World Championships 2023: Key information</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 143: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Bodies hunched over bars, mud-caked faces set to permanent grimace, this was every bit the scene that had inspired Clews all those years ago. Trinity Racing’s Luke Lamperti eventually triumphed, leading home a 26-man final sprint in the centre of Melton Mowbray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The quality of the teams was higher this year,’ Clews says when asked to reflect on the event. ‘That’s very encouraging, and the higher-quality teams are the ones already asking to come back. Our philosophy of presenting something different is what is making our race a hit.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Not all guts and glory</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few months, many have painted a gloomy picture of Britain’s domestic racing scene. As well as the cancellation of high-profile races such as the Women’s Tour and Tour Series, British Cycling’s National Road Series has a reduced calendar in 2023 – one round being lost for both the men’s and women’s Series – while a search of British Cycling’s National A and National B road race calendar currently returns a total of 133 events for 2023 compared to 173 in 2022. That’s a decline of nearly a quarter.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Domestic UK racing scene\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Saint Piran’s 33-year-old Alex Richardson has taken wins at home and abroad, but few races will leave them as muddy as Britain’s spectacular Rutland-Melton International CICLE Classic.</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Add in the folding of the men’s UCI Continental team AT85 in March (reducing the number of British Conti teams to two, the fewest for 15 years) plus the fact that the number of British-registered elite women’s teams has fallen by nearly 25% in 12 months, and it’s hard not to see a pretty bleak picture of road racing in this country. But there is hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to some of the people immersed in the scene and you start to find some green shoots of promise. No one is saying that all is rosy in the garden of British road racing, but many are confident that there is ample opportunity for the scene to bounce back strongly in the coming years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What becomes clear in those discussions, however, is that it’s those who are doing things a little differently that are best positioned to rejuvenate the scene and reap the rewards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CiCLE Classic is a prime example. It might be nearly 20 years since Clews formed the idea, but his dream of creating a visceral and arresting race has stood the test of time.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Domestic UK racing scene\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Saint Piran’s team manager and sports director Steve Lampler discusses tactics with his riders.</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The budget for the first race was about £4,000,’ says Clews. ‘It attracted people’s attention because photos of riders coming over rough tracks and kicking up dust were quite alien to how racing looked in this country.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This attention allowed Clews to attract further sponsorship and grow the event into men’s, women’s and junior races, with the men’s the only UCI international one-day race on the domestic calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The one thing I hoped was that by going international I would encourage others to take that step, to show that it wasn’t that far removed from what they were already doing.

Clews estimates costs have increased by 15% since Covid, and attracting funding remains a constant battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I approached two local authorities when I launched, and both said they were among the poorest-funded councils in the country,’ he says. ‘If that was in 2003, you can imagine what they’d say now.

It is, as you might have guessed, one of the two remaining British Continental teams (the other being Trinity Racing).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Named after one of Cornwall’s patron saints, the men’s elite team is just one component of an ambitious project founded by Richard Pascoe that also boasts a women’s elite road team, mountain bike teams and men’s and women’s development squads. All the elites ride under the Saint Piran banner while the 05/03 development teams are named in honour of St Piran’s Day, 5th March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spanning so many categories and disciplines might not sound groundbreaking but it’s a successful formula: in May, Alex Richardson led a Saint Piran 1-2-3 at the Lincoln Grand Prix, a one-day race that’s part of the National Road Series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Saint Piran’s approach truly unique, however, is it also includes a cafe and bike hire shop, a strong involvement in putting on local events, plus product lines as diverse as ice-cream, Cornish cider and its own kit label.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s at the bike shop near Bissoe, just a few kilometres outside Truro, that <em>Cyclist</em> meets Pascoe and women’s team manager Jenny Bolsom to talk about the domestic scene over a coffee – made from Saint Piran beans, naturally.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Domestic UK racing scene\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>They both acknowledge that times are tough, but they also believe there is the potential for a stronger scene to emerge – one that can support more than just teams like theirs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Because of the reduction in the scene, my viewpoint is potentially controversial,’ says Pascoe. ‘But I think this country should have one ProTeam [second tier] partnered with several WorldTour teams [first tier] and supported by three Conti teams [third tier]. And that would be it. I don’t think there is the volume of riders to sustain six or seven men’s Conti teams like we had a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We need team owners, the governing body and race organisers to have this dialogue; they are all intrinsically linked,’ Bolsom adds. ‘So I think the shrinking of the scene can actually be a good thing. We should concentrate on what we’ve got.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given her role, Bolsom’s focus is naturally on women’s racing. As well as managing Saint Piran’s women’s teams, she organises races throughout the southwest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We have seen events cancelled left, right and centre because of a lack of entries,’ she says. ‘You’ve often got organisers that, if they can’t find sponsorship or funding, are relying on rider entries to fund their race. Sometimes you could need more than 30 or 40 riders to make an event work, but I’ve been to races that had seven. Then there are the calendar clashes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You get lots of regions and different disciplines that don’t talk to one another.

Saint Piran’s men’s sports director, Steve Lampier, tells a story of one young rider under his charge who puts out great numbers but who – because of the lack of race opportunities – struggles with how best to utilise that strength. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lampier contrasts this with his own racing experience, where he was able to learn such racecraft as a junior because of the club structure that was once common in Britain. Still, he is keen to point out this is not just an issue in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They’ll have that problem in the WorldTour now because they’re taking riders based on pure power and taking them from juniors into seniors so they don’t have that learning.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is perhaps even more pronounced in domestic women’s racing, where third category riders compete in the same races as elites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Return of the Tours</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Key to a vibrant domestic scene are high-level races that bring TV cameras and roadside spectators, so it’s understandable that the news this year’s Women’s Tour and Tour Series would take a hiatus felt like a hammer blow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sponsors want to see their products on show at these big races, so it’s difficult for the teams not to have that platform,’ says Bolsom, who describes how crucial the trickle-down effect of the Women’s Tour is to aspirations of taking her team up to Conti level.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Domestic UK racing scene\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rutland-Melton founder Colin Clews wanted to bring some of the drama and spectacle of the Classics to Britain.</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Peter Hodges, PR and marketing director at SweetSpot, which puts on these races, points to the fact that the Women’s Tour, Tour Series and the Tour of Britain all suffered cancellations or rescheduling due to Covid: ‘The last three years have been a drain on resources, and I don’t just mean money; it’s people, partners, everything. It has been incredibly challenging.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hodges says the difficulty in obtaining local authority funding was a key issue in relation to the Tour Series’s postponement, while the Women’s Tour, when faced with increased cost pressures, struggled to attract investment from commercial partners. The rub is that these commercial partners are cash-strapped too, and hence are only investing in races with wide exposure already – which sadly means men’s events are taking precedence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hodges remains positive, though, saying that the recent boom in women’s football, cricket and rugby can help pave the way for women’s cycling, even if those sports are also fishing in the same waters for large-scale sponsorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That just means we have to redouble our efforts. We’ve got to keep growing the women’s side of the sport because the interest is there.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hodges is well aware of the importance of the Women’s Tour and Tour Series to the domestic scene – ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ – and says SweetSpot is using the hiatus to review and reboot both events. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-970x693.jpg\" alt=\"Domestic UK racing scene\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-970x693.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-300x214.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-768x548.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-350x250.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-750x536.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-1140x814.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08-190x136.jpg 190w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For the Tour Series that might mean looking to emulate events such as cricket’s The Hundred series ‘to give it more razzmatazz and bring it into the 21st century’, all while filling the gap in local authority resources by taking responsibility for providing associated events for children and the wider community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve started presenting to councils for next year’s Series,’ says Hodges. ‘With the Women’s Tour we’ve already applied to the UCI for our dates next June. We have contracts for Stage 1 next year, which will be in Wales, and have already had conversations with a couple of venues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several of the venues that were due to host this year’s race want to roll that involvement into next year, and we’ve had a long-term plan with a venue to host the final stage. Our aim is that by early October we’ll be able to announce the starts and finishes of all the Women’s Tour stages, which then provides some of that certainty when talking with potential sponsors or partners.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first time that bike racing in Britain has faced tough times, but the underlying feeling among those in the know is that this current downturn is just as likely a blip than the start of a sharper decline.

Development teams now ride under the 05/03 name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as competing domestically and abroad, Saint Piran are active in the community, organising club events and rides, with membership open to all. The Saint Piran Cycling Community Interest Company was formed in 2021 and plans to turn a former bank building in Redruth into a community hub. Sustainability and wellbeing are core principles and Saint Piran is working with Exeter University to examine and reduce its carbon footprint, and has drafted in wellbeing coaching provider EDelia Group to offer lifestyle support and advice to its riders and staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most progressive of all is the fact Saint Piran intentionally has no title sponsor. Instead funding is through multiple channels including long-term commercial partnering, membership, licensing and adopt-a-rider or race initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot of people feel that you have to be a bike racer or a race organiser,’ Pascoe says. ‘We have proven that you can be both.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Five designs for life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A number of themes that arose from this piece that could help the domestic scene</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Domestic UK racing scene\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/uk-racing-scene-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Improve co-ordination:</strong> whether between race organisers in pursuit of a more coherent race calendar or teams harnessing their collective purchasing power to lower costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be proactive:</strong> if there is a lack of races in your area, fill that void.
