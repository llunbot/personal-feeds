Apple says that it is aware of a report that the bug could have been actively exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 17.2. Apple fixed the issue with improved memory management.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also addressed over 20 other vulnerabilities. One could allow an attacker with physical access to an unlocked device to access the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app even when an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> is locked, and there were several issues with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> that could allow attackers to execute code or crash apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwo kernel vulnerabilities could let malicious apps gain kernel privileges, and there were a handful of WebKit fixes for Safari.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause of the number of security issues fixed in the update, it is a good idea to update to the new software right away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nwatchOS 11.3 and tvOS 18.3 also have a number of security fixes, so those updates should be installed as well. If you have macOS Sonoma or Ventura, Apple has released macOS 14.7.3 and macOS Ventura 13.7.3 with security improvements.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/ios-18-3-macos-sequoia-15-3-security-updates/\">Update Now: iOS 18.3 and macOS Sequoia 15.3 Include 20+ Security Updates</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/update-now-ios-18-3-and-macos-sequoia-15-3-include-20-security-updates.2448218/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"781c0f385efc4c73938ad319eb88bd88103fb362501f6844dae314212364008d","category":"Apple"}
