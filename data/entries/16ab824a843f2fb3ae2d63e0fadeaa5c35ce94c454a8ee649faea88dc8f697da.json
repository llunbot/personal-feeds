One of the specialized services offered was designed to help people in possession of large numbers of stolen or lost mobile devices to obtain the credentials needed to bypass protections such as the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120837\">lost mode</a> for iPhones, which prevent a lost or stolen device from being used without entering its passcode.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iserver-model.png\"><img alt=\"iServer's phishing-as-a-service model.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iserver-model-640x289.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iserver-model-1280x578.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iserver-model.png\">iServer's phishing-as-a-service model.</a> (credit: Group-IB)</p></div>\n<h2>Catering to low-skilled thieves</h2>\n<p>An international operation coordinated by Europol’s European Cybercrime Center <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/criminal-phishing-network-resulting-in-over-480-000-victims-worldwide-busted-in-spain-and-latin-america\">said</a> it arrested the Argentinian national that was behind iServer and identified more than 2,000 “unlockers” who had enrolled in the phishing platform over the years.
