This guide highlights everything that's new with the Translate app and the translation features in ‌iOS 15‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>System-Wide Translation</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> introduced a new Translate app that can be used to translate conversations from one language to another, and also added translation features to Safari.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/system-wide-translation-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn ‌iOS 15‌, translation capabilities are expanding further and can be used system-wide. You can select any text anywhere in ‌iOS 15‌ and choose the new \"Translate\" option to translate it into your preferred language.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Live Text</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n‌iOS 15‌ adds a Live Text feature that lets your ‌iPhone‌ detect text in any image or photo on your device. You can select text in images and it works like any other text on your ‌iPhone‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/live-text-translation-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can copy text, paste text, and use the built-in system-wide translation feature to translate text. So if you're in another country and need to read a sign or a menu in a foreign language, you can snap a quick picture, highlight the text, and choose the translate option to see just what it says.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLive Text can be selected and translated in ‌Photos‌, screenshots, Quick Look, Safari, and even live previews with the Camera app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Translate App</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the system-wide translation feature, Apple has made several improvements to the dedicated Translate app, which is designed for communicating with someone who speaks another language.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Conversation Updates</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Translate app's conversation feature has been updated to make it easier to get into conversation mode. Just tap on the Conversation tab in landscape or portrait view, which is located at the bottom of the Translate app. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/translate-conversation-tab-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nChat bubbles have been added to the conversation mode so that it's easier to follow along with the chat.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Auto Translate</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Translate app is now able to auto translate speech without the need to tap on the microphone button when in conversation mode.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/translate-ios-15-auto-translate.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt automatically detects when you start speaking and when you stop, so the other person can just respond without the need for interacting with the ‌iPhone‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Face to Face View</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nThe conversation view has a face to face option so that each person participating in the conversation through the Translate app can see their own side of the chat.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/translate-face-to-face-mode-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Language Selection Improvements</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nApple has made it easier to select languages through drop-down menus.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-translate-app-language-drop-down.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Guide Feedback</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nHave questions about the updated Translate app features in ‌iOS 15‌, know of a feature we left out, or want to offer feedback on this guide? <a href=\"mailto:guides@macrumors.com\">Send us an email here</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-translate-app/\">Everything New With Translation in iOS 15: System-Wide Support, Live Text Translation and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-new-with-translation-in-ios-15-system-wide-support-live-text-translation-and-more.2308086/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UZw5PBwekHc:pvhrbQh-CB0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UZw5PBwekHc:pvhrbQh-CB0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UZw5PBwekHc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"63c053cc44fbaa9630d1ce43d040ea1f9bf0e108ad25423064c3fea8a6e8979d","category":"Apple"}
