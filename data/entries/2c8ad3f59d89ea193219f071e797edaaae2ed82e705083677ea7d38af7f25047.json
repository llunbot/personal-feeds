Lowe's Style Studio offers a 3D kitchen environment that can be customized with hundreds of real-world materials, fixtures, and appliances.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Vision Pro owners are able to use the Style Studio app at home, many Lowe's customers who are planning a kitchen remodel might not have a Vision Pro available to see the different kitchen options. They can instead visit a Lowe's location to partake in an immersive kitchen visualization session.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA Lowe's employee will guide customers through the kitchen creation process during a one-on-one appointment, where there are 80 billion design combinations available. Completed kitchen setups can be saved, emailed, texted, or AirDropped as a PDF, with the content in the kitchen able to be purchased through Lowe's.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom June 8 to June 12, the Vision Pro demo is available at the Central Charlotte, NC Lowe's, and from June 22 through June 25, it will be available at Lowe's stores in North Bergen, New Jersey and Sunnyvale, California. Customers in these areas will be able to <a href=\"https://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/projects/lss-in-store\">book a session online</a>, with Lowe's also able to accommodate some walk-ins.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/lowes-launches-in-store-apple-vision-pro-experience/\">Lowe's Launches In-Store Apple Vision Pro Experience</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lowes-launches-in-store-apple-vision-pro-experience.2428241/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2c8ad3f59d89ea193219f071e797edaaae2ed82e705083677ea7d38af7f25047","category":"Apple"}
