A friendly ding or text alert on the home screen notifies users about new text messages, emails, social media comments, news updates, packages delivered, gameplay nudgesâ€”basically any app activity where notifications have been enabled could be tracked by governments, Wyden said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989091#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989091&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4329c579c201db9d5df52adb454487c69df64f6bf8b83ba90fd7dd804066ee44","category":"Tech"}
