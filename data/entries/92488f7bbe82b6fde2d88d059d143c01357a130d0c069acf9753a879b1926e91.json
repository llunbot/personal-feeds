When visionOS 1.1 landed a month ago, it mostly polished up a few sore spots from the release version (like the inability to reset your device). There’s no telling what visionOS 1.2 will bring–“Spatial Personas” is coming to all Vision Pro headsets before the 1.2 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in visionOS 1.2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know yet what is new in visionOS 1.2, but we’ll update this section as new features and changes are discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>visionOS 1.2: How to install the public beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not sure if Apple will have a public beta program for visionOS yet—there’s no Public Beta option yet, but the device is still quite new. We expect it would work like it does on other Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll probably join the beta by opening <em>Settings</em>, selecting <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Updates</em>. In the Beta Updates section, choose <em>visionOS Public Beta</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>visionOS 1.2: How to install the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer, but you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta; a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958&amp;xcust=1-1-2285670-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"92488f7bbe82b6fde2d88d059d143c01357a130d0c069acf9753a879b1926e91","category":"Apple"}
