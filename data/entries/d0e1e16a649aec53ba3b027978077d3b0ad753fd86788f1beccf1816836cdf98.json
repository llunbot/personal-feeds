The sale price is usually $279, but Amazon is cutting the price even more for Black Friday: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9CJM1Z?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">You can get the 64GB iPad for $230</a>, a savings of $99 and the best price we’ve ever seen for this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9th-gen iPad has a 10.2-inch display, an A13 Bionic processor, and a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage. It’s the only iPad that still has Apple’s classic Home button design and a Lightning port, but it’s still one of the best tablets you can buy for kids, students, and anyone else looking for a lightweight tablet for games, movies, and work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll be tracking Apple sales all week, but we don’t think we’ll see an iPad deal better than this. So go grab one before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d0e1e16a649aec53ba3b027978077d3b0ad753fd86788f1beccf1816836cdf98","category":"Apple"}
