Now, they're ready to embody our favorite mecha-themed science fiction indulgencesâ€”if you have 400 million yen (about $2.7 million) to splurge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tsubame-hi.com/\">Tsubame Industries</a>, a Tokyo-based startup, currently has five Archax units, a pilotable robot, available for preorder, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/japan-startup-develops-gundam-like-robot-with-3-mln-price-tag-2023-10-02/\">Reuters</a> this week. Tsubame unveiled the robot this summer and plans to demo the robot at the Japan Mobility Show from October 26 through November 5. Tsubame won't just have a giant robot on display; the robot will demonstrate movement of its upper body and arms, according to a Google translation of an August report from Japanese publication <a href=\"https://robotstart.info/2023/08/19/archax-unveiled.html\">Robot Start</a>.</p>\n<p>Built with human-like proportions, Archax has moving rear legs and front legs and uses front-wheel steering. It also has a movable head (left and right), waist (left and right), shoulders (up and down), elbows, wrists, and fingers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973238#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973238&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"01c81be10929569de8d1c39338d48b475da3d0221cca9df87fb90454fe180bef","category":"Tech"}
