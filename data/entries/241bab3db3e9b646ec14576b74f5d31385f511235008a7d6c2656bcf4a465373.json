Aberdeenshire, in the east of the country, is a secret sanctuary for the road cyclist, with stunning routes, top-notch accommodation for all budgets, easy access by major roads from England or elsewhere in Scotland, and – here’s the clincher – summer temperatures in the mid-20s (yep, it’s definitely shorts and short-sleeved jersey territory). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to these attractions the fact that the county has much less traffic than more traditional Scottish visitor destinations, is packed with culture and quality eateries, offers routes for all ages and abilities and has far fewer biting insects than the west coast, and the stage is set for a cycling holiday to remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cycling heritage and routes to remember</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of stages, Aberdeenshire hosted the Grand Depart of the 2022 Tour of Britain, proving that it’s possible to ride from the city of Aberdeen itself to undulating ski resorts in less than a day’s ride. As you might expect north of the border, the area is replete with epic climbs, stunning views, rolling countryside and wide, open spaces. Here are just a handful of the climbs to put on your Aberdeenshire bucket list…</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Going up in the world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aberdeenshire boasts at least 10 cracking ascents, ranging from the short and sharp to the lengthy and attritional. And the best thing about them – beyond the satisfaction of cresting their summits – is it’s possible to combine them into a few big days in the saddle. The VisitAberdeenshire website has <a href=\"https://www.visitabdn.com/ascents\" target=\"_blank\">fully mapped routes</a> for each of the following climbs, as well as details of <a href=\"https://www.visitabdn.com/blog/try-these-suggested-routes-for-conquering-the-aberdeenshire-ascents\" target=\"_blank\">how to string them together</a> into a handful of long days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gairnshiel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At 5.12km and an average gradient of 4.4%, this ascent lies near the village of Ballater, within the Cairngorms National Park. It starts easily enough, has a false summit about a third of the way in, then ramps up again. Our tip: get your breath back after the false summit, then prepare to dig in!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cabrach</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially three climbs in one, this ascent starts near the town of Huntly and covers 9.06km at an average of 2.6%. It might sound easy, but it’s long!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cairnwell</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just south of Braemar, this climb is a relentless 3.61km at an average 5.2%. Most of it is around 5%, so there’s no respite until you reach the ski centre at Glenshee. Treat yourself to a brew at Tea at the Shee before the descent back to Braemar – you’ll have earned it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cairn o’Mount</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A star of the 2021 Tour of Britain, smashing this climb is a pro-level achievement. It’s more than 9km at an average of 9.7%. And there’s a sting in its tail, with the gradient ramping up in the final third.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suie</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just north of Alford (where there are plenty of places to fuel up), this is a 1.87km battle against an average grade of 9%. The current Strava KOM is 5min 47sec, if you’re the kind of rider who likes a challenge…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Lecht</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An exposed 3.2km climb near Corgarff Castle to the Lecht Ski Centre, the Lecht averages 7.6% and can be a major challenge in less than perfect weather. Put it this way, you don’t want anything less than a strong southerly wind – it’ll be on your back all the way up!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Causey Mounth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fancy a smash ’n’ grab KOM? This ascent is just 0.78km long at an average gradient of 7.9%, rewarded at the top by spectacular views across the city of Aberdeen. Reckon you can beat the current record of 1min 50sec? Stick it in the big ring and consider it sprint training…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Queen’s View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigate delightful west-to-east farmland on this more palatable climb near Tarland, with a relatively relaxed average grade of 2.6% over its 4.87km length.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Lord’s Throat</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, stop laughing at the back… You’ll start this punchy climb near the Aberdeenshire town of Alford, but if you’re going to hit it hard, we’d recommend grabbing some food in the town after, not before. The full gas 1.21km slog at an average of 6.5% is best attempted without a full stomach…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pennan to New Aberdour</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As much a mini route as a climb, this 6.02km ride takes you from the coastal village of Pennan, up a 151m climb, before deposited you in New Aberdour via a rapid descent. Our tip? Once finished, reverse the route; repeat until exhausted!</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Fuel up for adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aberdeenshire has proper all-day-ride potential in the summer, with the sun rising around 5am and setting at 11pm. In short, you’ll need plenty of fuel! Thankfully, Aberdeenshire is not short of that – there are plenty of top-quality coffee stops and cafes. Here are just a few…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ride Coffee House, Banchory</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a perfect place to stop mid-ride, or ride out to from the city, being situated on the River Dee, around 35km west of Aberdeen itself. Expect quality cakes, breakfast, lunch and brunch, and plenty of good coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tarmachan Cafe, Crathie (near Balmoral)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This delightful cafe in the heart of The Cairngorms, just off the A93, offers drinks, cake, hot pies and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Highlanders Bakehouse, Crathie</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An artisan cafe and bakery offering not only mouth-watering lunches but also the world’s only pastry designed for jersey pockets – the sausage roll! You never see them being handed up to pro riders during races, though, do you…? Weird.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Old Post Office, Chapel of Garioch (near Inverurie)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh, homemade food in relaxing surroundings, and – if you want to bask in the sunshine while you refuel – there’s even outdoor seating and a lawn.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/visit-aberdeenshire-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Cycling-focused accommodation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>’Aberdeenshire’s many forms of accommodation are well geared up for cyclists, with the region even providing funding via the North East Adventure Tourism Project to assist providers to instal secure bike storage facilities.
