On first glance, that's a pretty big number that suggests the formation of a pretty healthy VR software ecosystem.</p>\n<p>But looked at in context, Ars' analysis suggests the Quest software market is roughly the same size as that for the Wii U at a similar point in its short life cycle. That's not a great comparison for Meta to be facing, since the Wii U was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/nintendo-announces-the-end-of-wii-u-production/\">rightly considered an embarrassing flop</a> by the standards of the video game market.</p>\n<h2>Comparing apples to... VR apples</h2>\n<p>In making that comparison, Ars compared Wii U software unit sales numbers from <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/\">Nintendo's own quarterly reports</a> to estimated software sales numbers based on Meta's <a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-quest-store-revenue-1-billion-milestone-growth-meta/\">sporadic</a> <a href=\"https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-1-billion-quest-store/\">public</a> <a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-sold-150-million-revenue-content/\">announcements</a> of Quest revenue milestones. To convert revenue numbers to unit sales estimates for the Quest, Ars divided total Quest revenue by the median sale price for <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/258035155854818/\">best-selling Quest software</a> ($19.99) and the mean sale price for that same software ($17.60).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971970#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971970&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2dd5937217da0ce132325b4fd19cb7b926c090e5d28b98df8b6fc1c6cace6f31","category":"Tech"}
