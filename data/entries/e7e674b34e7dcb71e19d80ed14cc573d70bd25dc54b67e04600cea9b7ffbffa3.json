Even though the Thunderbolt Display used an older Thunderbolt standard, it remained compatible with Thunderbolt 3 when that newer standard was released, as well as with the even fresher Thunderbolt 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Thunderbolt Display offered a Thunderbolt 2 data connection via a jack that is identical in appearance to Mini DisplayPort. Thunderbolt 3 requires USB-C, a standard that can connect devices and computers using Thunderbolt 3/4, USB 3.1 and later, and USB4. USB-C is a specification for ports, jacks, and cables; Thunderbolt and USB’s numbered standards define what flows over those connections. (There were some tweaky elements of using Mini DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 2 when Apple transitioned from the former to the latter, but none of that is relevant with USB-C or Thunderbolt 3/4.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to use a Thunderbolt Display, most people rely on Apple’s Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter, for which Apple still charges a whopping $49. This adapter has a USB-C jack on one end, and you can only get the display to work <em>if it’s plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 or 4 port</em> on your Mac or an external Thunderbolt dock.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mac911-mac-adapter-usb-adapter-a115.png\" alt=\"Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mac911-mac-adapter-usb-adapter-a115.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 700w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mac911-mac-adapter-usb-adapter-a115.png?resize=300%2C51&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"700\" height=\"119\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple’s Thunderbolt 2 to 3 display has a Thunderbolt 2 port in the main body, which looks identical to Mini DisplayPort, and a USB-C jack on the other end, which only works when plugged into a Thunderbolt 3/4 port.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mac911-mac-adapter-usb-adapter-a115.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 700w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mac911-mac-adapter-usb-adapter-a115.png?resize=300%2C51&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"700\" height=\"119\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Apple’s Thunderbolt 2 to 3 display has a Thunderbolt 2 port in the main body, which looks identical to Mini DisplayPort, and a USB-C jack on the other end, which only works when plugged into a Thunderbolt 3/4 port.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mac911-mac-adapter-usb-adapter-a115.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 700w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mac911-mac-adapter-usb-adapter-a115.png?resize=300%2C51&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"700\" height=\"119\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Apple’s Thunderbolt 2 to 3 display has a Thunderbolt 2 port in the main body, which looks identical to Mini DisplayPort, and a USB-C jack on the other end, which only works when plugged into a Thunderbolt 3/4 port.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Plug it into a USB 3.x/USB4 port on an external dock or a USB 3.x/USB4-only port on certain Macs (like the lower-end Mac Studio models’ front two ports) and the display doesn’t function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason is convoluted. The display relies on DisplayPort data coming from the computer to show the screen. However, even though USB 3.x/USB4 support passing through DisplayPort data, the hardware on the Apple Thunderbolt Display can’t interpret that—it only has a chip that can accept Thunderbolt-encoded information, including the method by which DisplayPort is wrapped up for Thunderbolt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s one of the remaining cases where USB-C frustrates an average user with a mix of older and newer gear. The telltale is the lightning bolt symbol on Apple’s adapter: there’s a Thunderbolt lightning bolt on both the input side (for Thunderbolt 2) and output (for Thunderbolt 3/4). The USB logo is entirely different and absent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233993/connect-old-apple-display-to-a-new-mac-to-give-it-new-life.html\">Learn more about connecting older Apple displays to a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Mike.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
