The Douglas County Health Department (DCHD) declared a public health emergency Friday.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.douglascountyhealth.com/images/TB_HAN_2023.pdf\">a press release</a>, DCHD said the exposures occurred at a daycare at the Westview YMCA, which provides \"drop-in\" care, allowing members to drop off their kids as they use the facility. The exposures occurred between May 21, 2023, and October 30, 2023.</p>\n<p>Childrenâ€™s Nebraska pediatric hospital quickly set up a clinic this weekend to test children ages 4 and under who were potentially exposed in the last 10 weeks. Children in this age group need \"window prophylaxis\" treatment to prevent the development of tuberculosis as testing is underway. Later this week, DCHD will set up a clinic to test children ages 5 and up who were potentially exposed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983356#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983356&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3069fd23b248111ac18e27807fc8c94094229d2bd74909313a66fcbe423a54cc","category":"Tech"}
