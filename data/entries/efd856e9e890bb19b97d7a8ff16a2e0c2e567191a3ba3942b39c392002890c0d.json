Even with the advent of bib shorts with cargo pockets, nothing compares to a pack with a hydration bladder when it comes to water and gear-hauling capacity.</p>\n<p>The best packs can help you be prepared out on the trails and organise your riding essentials. Plus, carrying up to three litres of water (that’s the equivalent of four large bottles) comfortably allows for big, all-day rides.</p>\n<p>Hydration packs, just like everything else in the bike world, have evolved brilliantly. There’s a huge range of shapes, sizes and features.</p>\n<p>Our list of the best hydration packs will help keep you hydrated, comfortable and ready to take on the trails.

They come in a variety of sizes and styles to suit any type of riding.</p>\n<p>Hydration packs have benefits over water bottles because they enable riders to carry more water – typically 2 to 3 litres rather than the 1.5 litres of two large bottles.</p>\n<p>A pack allows you to bring along more food, tools, clothing and other riding essentials. In some instances they can provide back and spine protection.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A hydration pack can make long days in the saddle easier, especially when water sources are few and far between.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You might think of CamelBak when you hear the words “hydration pack”. That’s common, and CamelBak created the original hydration pack back in 1989.</p>\n<p>To say the first iteration was simple is an understatement. CamelBak founder Michael Eidson slid an IV bag into a tube sock when he was competing in a bike race in Texas called the Hotter ‘n Hell 100. The packs have come a long way since then.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the number of manufacturers making hydration packs has exploded. Hydration packs tailored to the demands of hiking, running, snow sports, and even the military now exist alongside cycling-specific bags.</p>\n<p>Within cycling, there are now low-profile packs for road use, hip packs for shorter rides, all-day packs with enough room for food, clothes and gear and even pint-size packs for kids.</p>\n<h2>What to consider when buying a hydration pack</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lightweight hydration packs are a good choice if you don’t need to carry loads of extra gear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Water capacity</h3>\n<p>Hydration pack fluid capacity varies from about 1 to 3 litres. How much do you need? That depends on you. It also depends on the temperature, how long you plan to be out, and the availability of refills.</p>\n<p>How much should you drink? <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-stay-hydrated-on-your-bike/\">Drinking water is essential for maintaining performance </a>and a very general baseline recommendation is roughly half a litre for every hour. This, of course, is highly dependent on heat, humidity and your personal chemistry.</p>\n<h3>Capacity for gear</h3>\n<p>One of the best reasons to use a hydration pack as opposed to bottles is the ability to haul gear. Mountain bikes have become more reliable but flat tyres, bent wheels and broken chains can still happen, and when they do in the middle of nowhere, it’s essential to have the parts and ability to fix them.</p>\n<p>Carrying food and extra clothes is also relatively easy with a pack. Plus, most hydration packs also have fleece-lined pockets for sunglasses, goggles and cameras.</p>\n<h3>Straps and harnesses</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mesh straps and rear will save you from soaking through your jersey on hot days.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Almost all rucksack-style hydration packs are built with the features you can expect from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-backpack/\">best cycling backpacks</a>. These include padded, ventilated shoulder straps, hip belts for stability, and sternum straps to pull the shoulder straps together.</p>\n<p>On the back panel, where the pack sits on your back, look out for channels to get a bit of airflow in there and help you stay cool. Some packs even have a suspended mesh back.</p>\n<h3>Hip packs</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hip packs have the same functionality as backpack-style hydration packs, just with less capacity.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hip-packs/\">best hip packs</a> help you stay hydrated and carry tools on a ride.</p>\n<p>Compared to rucksack-style hydration packs, they tend to offer less storage capacity and have smaller bladder sizes. This makes them ideal for when you don’t need to carry so much kit and don’t need to drink as much water. They are also good if you simply prefer to not have a rucksack against your back whilst riding, which can be a nuisance, particularly in hot weather.</p>\n<p>Hip packs tend to have capacity for about 1.5 litres of water, so they still provide enough hydration for a decent ride. Storage capacity is lower than rucksacks and is often around 2 litres, but some hip packs go up to 5 litres.</p>\n<h3>Bite valve and hose</h3>\n<p>The bite valve is crucial because it’s where the water meets your mouth.</p>\n<p>Bite valves are typically comprised of soft rubber. Some require a simple squeeze to unleash the flow of water, others involve pressing a button with your tongue. Almost all bite valves have a lock or shut-off feature, which is invaluable when tossing a hydration pack in a car or another larger gear bag.</p>\n<p>The hose on most packs can be trimmed to length. On the pack itself, there will be hose guides and mounting clips to keep the hose from swinging about when riding.</p>\n<p>Optional hose accessories include sleeves to keep the water warm or cold (depending on the season) and even semi-rigid setups for angling the bite valve closer to your mouth.</p>\n<h3>Built-in body armour</h3>\n<p>A few pack manufacturers incorporate body armour-style padding and impact-absorbing plates into their packs to enhance protection. Reservoirs are built tough so they’re able to withstand the force of a hit.</p>\n<h3>Access and filling the reservoir</h3>\n<p>Hydration packs vary in how you get at the bladder itself. Some reservoirs reside inside the main pack, which saves weight, while others have their own dedicated compartment for protection from pokey tyre pumps, tube valves and multi-tools.</p>\n<p>Most reservoirs feature a detachable hose to make filling easier. To fill bladders with a permanent hose requires either slipping the hose out of the bag or carrying the whole bag over to the tap.</p>\n<h3>Looking after your hydration pack</h3>\n<p>Cleanliness is essential to hydration pack bladders. Ideally, they should be emptied immediately after use and hung out to dry. Several companies make drying inserts to keep the internal surfaces apart, and many riders modify a coat-hanger for the job.</p>\n<p>Another solution is keeping it in the fridge, where the cold keeps nasty stuff from growing.</p>\n<p>It’s recommended to only put water in the reservoir, simply because cleaning out <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/what-is-a-sports-drink-and-when-should-you-use-one/\">sports drinks</a> thoroughly is almost impossible. This inevitably leads to bacteria growth and then buying a new hose, bite valve or entire reservoir.</p>\n<h3>Other features</h3>\n<p>Hydration pack makers have really nailed the organisation part of the bags.</p>\n<p>All sorts of features are found in packs: special pockets for pumps and tools; hooks for keys; whistles; elastic cords for lashing on a jacket; <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">helmet</a> carry straps for when you’re off the bike; expandable compartments; headphone ports; and many others.</p>\n<p>It’s worth reading the detailed specs to find out what’s on offer and thinking about what extra benefits would be useful for your riding style.</p>\n<h3>Jargon</h3>\n<p><strong>Harness:</strong> The arrangement of shoulder straps, sternum (chest) strap and waist belt that secures the pack to your back. Some designs do away with the waist belt and rely on an extra sternum strap to pull the shoulder straps in tight.</p>\n<p><strong>Compression straps:</strong> On bigger packs especially, additional external straps are useful for cinching down your cargo to stop it shifting around when the bag isn’t stuffed to full capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Certified back protector:</strong> Level 1 or level 2 certification indicates the amount of impact energy transmitted through/absorbed by a CE-approved back protector. Level 2 designs offer more protection but are likely to be bulkier.</p>\n<p><strong>Bite valve:</strong> The rubber mouthpiece at the drinking end of the hose. This is usually replaceable and most have a twist-lock or lever closure to prevent leakage. Some come with a protective cap too, which is a plus for muddy rides.</p>\n<p><strong>HydraPak:</strong> A third-party supplier of hydration systems. A lot of brands use HydraPak reservoirs, hoses and bite valves in their packs, and we’ve rarely had a problem with them. Spares of nearly every component are available too.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"efd856e9e890bb19b97d7a8ff16a2e0c2e567191a3ba3942b39c392002890c0d","category":"Cycling"}
