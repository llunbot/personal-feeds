Are modern racing bikes simply so good they can be used to win on all terrains? Or are riders and teams just being denied the choice they once had by sponsors exerting ever greater influence over them?</p>\n<p>As always, it’s probably a bit of both.</p>\n<h2>The house always wins</h2>\n<p>We’ve touched on this before, but <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/house-brands-dominating-team-bikes-and-kit-in-the-worldtour/\" target=\"_blank\">the rise of house brands</a> within professional cycling has been happening faster than Julian Alaphilippe attacking on the Sint-Antoniusberg.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour bikes</a> are now typically dominated by big-ticket sponsors and components from large brands, who have (understandably) become increasingly keen to see their kit used in all races.</p>\n<p>While being handy with a black marker pen used to be a crucial skill for the professional mechanics (who often needed to ‘carefully’ disguise the fact non-sponsor correct items were being used), we don’t see so much of that anymore, except on prototype kit.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/11-clever-hacks-of-worldtour-race-mechanics/\">11 clever hacks of WorldTour race mechanics</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We used to see this every year at Paris-Roubaix, but not so much anymore.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Given these restraints, most teams and riders are simply left with fewer choices when it comes to kit.</p>\n<p>Sponsored by Continental? Well, you can have the Competition tubular or the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/continentals-grand-prix-5000-s-tr/\">GP5000 S TR</a> tubeless tyre.

While the absence of Paris-Roubaix for two-and-a-half years saw <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/paris-roubaix-tech-trends/\">wide tubeless tyres emerge as a key trend at the 2021 race</a>, that’s left little room for under-the-radar sponsor swaps.</p>\n<h2>New bikes are also really good</h2>\n<p>Without wanting to sound like a paid-up cycling industry illuminati devotee, a big part of this trend towards conformity is down simply to the fact that modern race bikes are now pretty amazing machines.</p>\n<p>I know many are sick of reading that every new road bike is a zillion watts faster at 50kph, 2kg lighter for the £10,000 frameset, 50 per cent laterally stiffer and yet still twice as vertically compliant as last year’s model, but some of those gains have actually made bikes much better.</p>\n<p>Over the years, we’ve seen all manner of wild innovations aimed at gaining an edge on the cobbles. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">Cyclocross bikes</a>, cantilever brakes and 32-spoke box section alloy wheels all used to be a relatively common sight at Paris-Roubaix, but these things simply aren’t required anymore.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/paris-roubaix-bikes-how-theyve-evolved/\">How Paris-Roubaix bikes have evolved</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Johan Museeuw riding a full-suspension bike during the 1994 Paris-Roubaix.

It’s a bike I was thoroughly impressed with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/merida-reacto-6000-review/\">when I tested the Ultegra spec Reacto 6000 version last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Equally impressive are two bikes which helped round out the podium, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-ridleys-new-noah-fast-will-live-up-to-its-name/\">Ridley Noah Fast</a> (as ridden by Florian Vermeersch) and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-canyon-aeroad/\">Canyon Aeroad</a> (as ridden by Mathieu van der Poel).</p>\n<p>All three bikes are fast, comfortable and – in their most bling guises – not too heavy either. They also feature strikingly similar silhouettes and design cues.</p>\n<p>With the UCI’s technical regulations being as prescriptive as they are, it’s no wonder so many brands are converging around a similar set of characteristics when it comes to making road racing bikes.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All three riders on the elite men’s podium rode their standard aero road bikes with wider tyres fitted.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Colbrelli, Van der Poel and Vermeersch would have had a choice of frameset and wheels, as all three of their respective bike and wheel sponsors make endurance (or weight) focused framesets and shallower carbon rims. It’s notable, therefore, all three apparently chose to stick with their aero race bikes.</p>\n<p>I wonder, had Deceuninck–Quick-Step, Bora-Hansgrohe and Trek-Segafredo riders had a free choice, how many would have chosen to ride a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl7-review/\">Specialized Tarmac SL7</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/2021-trek-madone-slr-project-one/\">Trek Madone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/trek-emonda-sl-6-pro-review/\">Trek Émonda</a> over the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-roubaix-expert-long-term-review/\">Specialized Roubaix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/trek-domane-sl6-review/\">Trek Domane</a>?</p>\n<p>These modern aero road bikes have adopted many of the endurance bike’s defining features, such as disc brakes, wider tyre clearances and carbon wheels optimised for wider tyres, negating any need to switch framesets.</p>\n<h2>The death knell for tubulars?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The big tyre brands are focusing the majority of their research and development on tubeless tyre systems.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most brands involved in cycling are pushing their latest products with the genuine belief they are better than the old ones.</p>\n<p>To revisit the Continental example; while there are obvious financial considerations behind the drive for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> to replace tubulars in the pro peloton (tubular tyres are a very niche product now, so there’s little financial incentive to keep developing or producing them), there are also performance advantages to be gained from the switch.</p>\n<p>As there’s less material and no glue involved, equivalent tubeless or clincher tyres typically produce less rolling resistance than tubulars.</p>\n<p>Clincher tyres have the win in the ease-of-use stakes but, as we already know, when you’ve got a professional sorting out your kit, ease of use is rarely a priority.</p>\n<p>Tubeless tyres are less prone to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-prevent-punctures/\">pinch flats</a>, too, and can make better use of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">tyre sealant</a> and internal liners (something we’ve seen in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/no-more-flat-tyres-three-puncture-preventers-tested/\">mountain biking world for a few years now</a>), to offer improved puncture protection and a run-flat solution. The Lotto-Soudal team of Vermeersch was among those to use tyre inserts at Paris-Roubaix.</p>\n\n<p>Just like aerodynamic bike frames, tubeless or clincher wheels and tyres do tend to be heavier than tubular equivalents. But many more pros are coming round to the fact this matters far less than traditionally thought, especially if the race doesn’t end with a mountain-top finish.</p>\n<p>Once the inevitable teething issues were ironed out, then, it was always likely <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubeless-tyres-pro-peloton/\">tubeless tyres would eventually have their say in the pro peloton</a>.</p>\n<h2>The future of Paris-Roubaix bike tech</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Sonny Colbrelli celebrating his victory in the elite men’s race.

The days of whacky custom bikes, with obscure parts purchased from artisan brands are, I fear, firmly behind us.</p>\n<p>It was fun while it lasted.</p>","author":"Simon Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"04685d2533c0d79135baccded90442e18cbbdb2bde9ba2a756b447b15f1e6bb7","category":"Cycling"}
