Its plastic lens gives the photos a unique quality, unique in today’s razor-sharp glass found on mirrorless systems, while offering a true-to-form photographic experience. Simply point and shoot. The Camp Snap V2 was just announced, so let’s take a closer look….</em><span></span></p>\n<p><strong>This is v2 of the Camp Snap Camera! It features a significantly faster shutter, more refined jpeg processing, ability to set date and time for metadata, ability to adjust sound level, and strap lugs (strap not included).</strong></p>\n<p>No more chimping over the day’s photos at camp being anti-social or looking to make sure your focus was dead-on in that last action shot. With the Camp Snap Camera, it’s one and done.</p>\n<p>With just a shutter button and a flash selector switch, the Camp Snap Camera is designed for easy, point-and-shoot operation. There are no complicated settings and menus – capture memorable moments with absolute ease.</p>\n<p>Designed with camping trips and coffee shop walks in mind, the Camp Snap Camera is lightweight and compact.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2700\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/CampSnapCameras2.jpg?fit=1200,1800&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/CampSnapCameras2.jpg?w=2700&amp;quality=75 2700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/CampSnapCameras2.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/CampSnapCameras2.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/CampSnapCameras2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/CampSnapCameras2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/CampSnapCameras2.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What’s in the box</strong>: Camp Snap Camera, USB-C cable, 4gb memory card included</li>\n<li><strong>Sensor</strong>: 8 megapixels, 1/3.2″</li>\n<li><strong>White Balance</strong>:  Auto.
