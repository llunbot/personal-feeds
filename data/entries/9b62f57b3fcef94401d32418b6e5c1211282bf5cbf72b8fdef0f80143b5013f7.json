In a Reddit\nAMA response posted Tuesday, Sonos CEO Spence <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1ew62yv/august_office_hours_w_keithfromsonos/lj3jwb8/\">says that</a> he\nwas hopeful “until very recently” that the company could\nrerelease the app, confirming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220421/sonos-s2-app-relaunch\">a report from The Verge</a> that\nthe company was considering doing so. But after testing that\noption, rereleasing the old app would apparently make things\nworse, Spence says.</p>\n\n<p>Since the new app was released on May 7th, Spence has issued a\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206203/sonos-ceo-apology-redesigned-app-controversy\">formal apology</a> and announced in August that the company\nwould be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215589/sonos-q3-2024-earnings-ace-headphone-buggy-app\">delaying the launch of two products</a> “until our app\nexperience meets the level of quality that we, our customers, and\nour partners expect from Sonos.”</p>\n\n<p>Here’s Spence’s explanation as to why it can’t bring back the\nold app:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The trick of course is that Sonos is not just the mobile app,\nbut software that runs on your speakers and in the cloud too. In\nthe months since the new mobile app launched we’ve been updating\nthe software that runs on our speakers and in the cloud to the\npoint where today S2 is less reliable &amp; less stable then what\nyou remember. After doing extensive testing we’ve reluctantly\nconcluded that re-releasing S2 would make the problems worse,\nnot better. I’m sure this is disappointing. It was disappointing\nto me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The new Sonos app is looking more and more like an entry for the Unpopular Redesigns Hall of Fame.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/26/sonos-old-app-rerelease-nope\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9b62f57b3fcef94401d32418b6e5c1211282bf5cbf72b8fdef0f80143b5013f7","category":"Tech"}
