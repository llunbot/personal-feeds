The Italian brand reached across the EU and tapped the Netherland’s A. Dugast to develop handmade tubulars, specifically for L’Eroica. These limited-edition tubulars are produced in 118 pieces – just 59 people in the world will be able to own them – and they are 100% hand-made by A. Dugast tire artisans in their workshop in the Netherlands. Only natural materials such as high-quality cotton, natural rubber, and natural latex are used.
