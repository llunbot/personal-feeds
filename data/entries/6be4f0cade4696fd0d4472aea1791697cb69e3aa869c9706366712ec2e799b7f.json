{"title":"Reuters on Apple’s Personalized Siri Apple Intelligence Delay","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-says-some-ai-improvements-siri-delayed-2026-2025-03-07/","date":1741381200000,"content":"\n<p>Stephen Nellis, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some artificial intelligence improvements to Apple’s voice\nassistant Siri will be delayed until 2026, the company said\non Friday.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, Apple said it has “been working on a more\npersonalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal\ncontext, as well as the ability to take action for you within and\nacross your apps. It’s going to take us longer than we thought to\ndeliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in\nthe coming year.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <em>really</em> don’t mean to be overly pedantic (so I’ve edited this post since original publication), but Apple’s statement reads “in the coming year”, so I think it’s possible we could see those features in iOS 19.0, 19.1, or 19.2 before the end of 2025.  Would I want to bet on that? No. This feels like something of a reset, not just a “<em>we need a few months</em>” type thing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple did not give a reason for the delays. The iPhone maker had previously indicated the features would come in 2025.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, hairsplitting, but I actually think “It’s going to take us longer than we thought” is a pretty good explanation.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/07/reuters-siri-delay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6be4f0cade4696fd0d4472aea1791697cb69e3aa869c9706366712ec2e799b7f","category":"Tech"}
