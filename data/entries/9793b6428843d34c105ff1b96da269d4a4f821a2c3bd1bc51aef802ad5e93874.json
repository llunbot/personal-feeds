There was no attempt to hide the app's true purpose behind some kind of vision test interface, which begs the question of how it made its way past the ‌App Store‌ review team.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌App Store‌ description mentioned comparing two pictures as an eyesight test, watching scenery, and playing games, but none of those features were present in the app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor an app focused on pirated content, Kimi had a fleshed out feature set. It offered top movies, search options, recommended suggestions, games, and more, with ads included for monetization purposes. The app was first approved in September, and it was available for several months in the iOS and macOS App Stores without Apple noticing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple pulled the app this morning after <em>The Verge</em> wrote about it, and it is no longer available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the second time in the last week that Apple's ‌App Store‌ has made headlines for questionable app approval. Last Thursday, popular password management app LastPass raised the alarm about a fake \"LassPass\" app that was imitating its design and feature set. Apple pulled the app about a day after the news was shared on media sites.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/pirated-movie-was-in-app-store/\">Pirated Movie App Disguised as Vision Test Snuck Onto App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pirated-movie-app-disguised-as-vision-test-snuck-onto-app-store.2419391/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9793b6428843d34c105ff1b96da269d4a4f821a2c3bd1bc51aef802ad5e93874","category":"Apple"}
