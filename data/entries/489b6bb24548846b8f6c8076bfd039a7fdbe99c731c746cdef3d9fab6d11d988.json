More than 500,000 people have already added a driver's license or ID to the California DMV Wallet app, where California tested the option before rolling it out to the Wallet app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"We're excited to be working with the state of California to bring IDs in Apple Wallet to Apple's home state soon, and provide residents with an easy, secure, and private way to present their California driver's license and state ID in person and in app using Apple Wallet,\" said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \"Whether using IDs in Apple Wallet to breeze through travel, or to securely verify age or identity at businesses, California driver's licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet make ID presentment seamless -- all with the security built into iPhone and Apple Watch.\"</blockquote>\r<br />\nIDs and licenses stored in the Wallet app on ‌iPhone‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> can be used for TSA screenings at select airports and for age verification at select stores. Right now, California's mobile wallet support is still in a pilot stage, and only 1.5 million participants are able to sign up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCalifornia requires people to continue to carry a physical license or ID card because the digital license is not accepted by law enforcement, state government agencies, and most businesses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEvidence that Apple Wallet integration was coming to California first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/iphone-drivers-license-support-coming-california/\">surfaced earlier in August</a> when a hidden landing page on the DMV website was discovered, but California and Apple are officially announcing the feature today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced a new Wallet app that supported digital IDs back in 2022, but states have been slow to adopt the feature. So far, only Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, and Ohio have implemented support. Apple said in 2022 that Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Utah are also working on support.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/california/\">California</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/iphone-drivers-license-california-soon/\">iPhone Driver's License Support Rolling Out Soon in California</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-drivers-license-support-rolling-out-soon-in-california.2433707/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"489b6bb24548846b8f6c8076bfd039a7fdbe99c731c746cdef3d9fab6d11d988","category":"Apple"}
