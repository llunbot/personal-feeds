Although the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ feature the same design as their predecessor, they improve on features like Active Noise Cancellation, in-ear detection, and battery life, while introducing new functionality like Adaptive Transparency, volume adjustment touch controls, and precision finding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recently introduced a major update for its standard AirPods, with the earbuds gaining a more refined design for improved comfort, H2 chip, dust, sweat, and water resistance, 5GHz connectivity, a vent system for pressure equalization, Personalized Volume, Voice Isolation, a USB-C port, and \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>\" command support – just like the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2. For an additional $50, the similarities with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ go even further with active noise cancellation, Transparency mode, Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, support for Apple Watch chargers, and a speaker in the case for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould you consider purchasing one of the fourth-generation AirPods models, or do you need the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌, which sell for $249?

As a result, the fourth-generation AirPods should be the default choice for most prospective buyers. If you also have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, which already offer ANC, and are looking for an additional pair of headphones to use while working out or on the go, the fourth-generation AirPods are also a good choice.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou should only buy the ‌AirPods Pro‌ if you are happy with its in-ear fit, which provides better sound quality and active noise cancellation, but can be somewhat uncomfortable for prolonger periods of time. While the fourth-generation AirPods do now offer ANC, it is not as effective as that of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ due to the lack of an in-ear fit, so if noice cancellation is your main priority, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 are still the best choice.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to better sound quality and ANC, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 also offer slightly longer battery life, Conversation Boost, touch controls for volume, ‌MagSafe‌ charger compatibility, Precision Finding with the U1 chip, and a lanyard loop, as well as hearing protection, testing, and aid features via an upcoming software update. Many users will be able to justify the additional $70 to get the ‌AirPods Pro‌ as a result. Nevertheless, the fourth-generation AirPods are still a solid option for most average customers and will be better for those who do not like the ‌AirPods Pro‌'s in-ear silicone tips. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌AirPods Pro‌ frequently see hefty discounts on Amazon and other third-party retailers, so stepping up to the Pro version may be more worth it if you can take advantage of one of those deals. The standard AirPods also often see solid discounts, so it is always worth seeking the best price <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods\">using our Deals roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-airpods-pro-2/\">AirPods 4 vs. AirPods Pro 2 Buyer's Guide: 20 Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-vs-airpods-pro-2-buyers-guide-20-differences-compared.2439639/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7045903c9df03437d42fc1550f8519a205b4db59c601efb7e7e9b76984ff4845","category":"Apple"}
