{"title":"Devinci Goes For The Groms With The Ewoc FS 24” (or 26”) Trail Bike","link":"https://bikerumor.com/devinci-ewoc-fs-24-26-kids-trail-bike/","date":1711551792000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-title-pic-800x534.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, title pic\" /></p>\n<p>Kids these days… spoiled rotten I tell you! Many well-established bike companies now offer appropriately sized (and tuned) MTBs for young riders, including Devinci Cycles and their new Ewoc FS trail bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ewoc FS is a full-suspension trail bike designed specifically for young shredders. It comes on 24” wheels, but the frame and fork are compatible with 26” wheels so the bike can grow with its rider. Aimed at groms approximately 9-12 years old and/or 4’4”- 4’11” tall, the Ewoc FS features Devinci’s Split Pivot suspension linkage with 125mms of rear travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-side-studio.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"747\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-side-studio.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, side, studio\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-side-studio.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-side-studio-297x185.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-side-studio-800x498.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-side-studio-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-side-studio-768x478.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ewoc FS frame is made in Canada from 6061 T6 aluminum. Knowing how kids can be rough on their stuff, Devinci gave it a durable powder coat paint job.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep maintenance easy, Devinci gave the Ewoc FS external cable routing. The frame was designed to offer a very low standover height and provides clearance for tires up to 2.4” wide (with 24” or 26” wheels).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-linkage-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ewoc’s suspension kinematics were specifically tuned for lightweight riders, so the linkage remains highly active even with low shock pressures. Devinci even builds the Ewoc frame with Enduro double-lip sealed bearings to ensure long-lasting, smooth suspension movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-dropper-post-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ewoc FS frame fits 31.6mm seat posts, and the stock dropper post has 100mm travel. The frame runs a Boost 148mm rear axle, and can fit a 28t or 30t chainring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A threaded BB makes crank maintenance simple, and a chainstay protector and lower down tube guard provide protection against rock strikes and chain slap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci gave the Ewoc FS modern geometry so young riders can tackle the trails with confidence. The head tube angle of 64.5° and 76° seat tube angle are right in line with today’s adult bikes. See the chart below for all the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-geo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1240\" height=\"604\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-geo.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-geo.jpg 1240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-geo-297x145.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-geo-800x390.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-geo-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-geo-768x374.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Component Highlights:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, suspension\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-suspension-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci went with a suspension package from X-Fusion for the Ewoc FS, with a 02PRO RL rear shock and a 140mm Velvet RL fork. The air-sprung fork offers a lockout and rebound adjustment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, brake lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-brake-lever-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Key kid-specific touches on the build include 155mm SRAM SX Eagle cranks and Promax short-reach brake levers. Promax’s 2-piston calipers grab 180mm front and rear rotors. Another youth-sized component is the 680mm wide V2 Pro handlebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, 12 speed cassette\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-12-speed-cassette-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s nothing kiddie about the Ewoc FS’s 12-speed SRAM SX Eagle drivetrain, featuring a wide range 11-50t cassette. Young rippers also get the benefit of a Trans-X 100mm dropper post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ewoc’s V2 Comp 24” rims have a 27mm inner width to spread out the Kenda AMRAK 24×2.4” tires, and a set of Wellgo pedals are included so this bike is shred-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Spec:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ewoc FS will be offered with one build spec – the Ewoc FS SX 12S.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-specs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1210\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-specs.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, build specs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-specs.jpg 1210w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-specs-297x147.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-specs-800x397.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-specs-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-specs-768x381.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Ewoc FS, kid riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Devinci-Ewoc-FS-kid-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>*Photo by Liam Wallace.
