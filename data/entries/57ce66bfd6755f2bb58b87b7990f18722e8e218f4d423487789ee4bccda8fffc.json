{"title":"Everything New in the iOS 17.5 Beta","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-5-beta-features/","date":1713305319000,"content":"Apple is currently testing iOS 17.5, the fifth major update to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> operating system that came out last September. Like iOS 17.4, iOS 17.5 primarily focuses on regulatory changes in the European Union, but there are a few other features worth noting.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Green-and-Purple.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThis guide aggregates everything that's been found during the iOS 17.5 beta testing period so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>App Downloads From Websites (EU Only)</h2>\r<br />\niOS 17.5 introduces support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/ios-17-5-app-website-downloads-eu/\">web-based app distribution</a> in the European Union, allowing developers to offer their apps for download directly on their websites. Apps can be downloaded from websites in the EU <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/ios-17-5-app-web-downloads-eu/\">as of the second beta</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with the iOS 17.4 changes that added alternative app marketplaces, this functionality is limited to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and can only be used in the EU. Developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and must have more than one million first installs on iOS in the prior year to offer an app for download.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll apps downloaded from websites onto iPhones must submit to Apple's notarization process, and while there is no commission to pay to Apple, Apple does charge a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Podcast Widget</h2>\r<br />\nThe Podcasts widget that can be added to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> or the Lock screen now features a background that changes depending on the art of the podcast that's being played.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mobile Device Management</h2>\r<br />\nMDM solutions are able to enforce a beta version during automated device enrollment. Automated device enrollment is designed to simplify initial device setup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple News+</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a>+ includes a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-17-5-apple-news-quartiles-game/\">daily word game</a> called Quartiles. The game requires players to combine tiles to form words and earn points. Quartiles is limited to customers who have a paid ‌Apple News‌+ subscription.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-17.5-Quartiles-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Code Changes</h2>\r<br />\nThere are several changes to the code in iOS 17.5, and these hint at features that could come later in the beta or when the update launches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Third-Party Item Tracker Alerts</h3>\r<br />\niOS 17.5 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-third-party-item-tracker-alerts/\">references support</a> for third-party item trackers, a feature that Apple has been working on since last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple and Google developed a cross-platform solution for unwanted tracking alerts, and it looks like iOS 17.5 will let ‌iPhone‌ users know when a third-party tracker is nearby. \"You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item,\" reads some of the code in the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle launched its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/google-android-find-my-device-network-2/\">Android-based Find My Device network</a> earlier this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>FaceTime</h3>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> may gain a \"Block All Participants\" option for group ‌FaceTime‌ calls, possibly for blocking spam. This feature does not appear to be functional as of yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>iPad Battery Health</h3>\r<br />\nThere are references to a Battery Health menu on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, a feature that is not currently available. This is not an option in the beta as of now, and it may be limited to the new iPads that Apple is rumored to be introducing in May.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Battery Health menu would likely show maximum remaining capacity and charge cycle count, similar to the Battery Health menu on ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>New Apple Pencil</h3>\r<br />\nThere are references to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> \"V4\" in the iOS 17.5 code, and there are also mentions of a \"squeeze\" feature that could perhaps add support for completing actions with a squeeze on the new ‌Apple Pencil‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\r<br />\nApple is likely to release iOS 17.5 in early May. New iPads are planned for May, so the update could come out right around when Apple debuts the new ‌iPad‌ models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-5-beta-features/\">Everything New in the iOS 17.5 Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-new-in-the-ios-17-5-beta.2424343/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57ce66bfd6755f2bb58b87b7990f18722e8e218f4d423487789ee4bccda8fffc","category":"Apple"}
