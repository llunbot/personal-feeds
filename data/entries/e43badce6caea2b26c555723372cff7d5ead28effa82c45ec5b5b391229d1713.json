No other major changes other than the chip, but the stand’s internal design has been tweaked. I’d expect colors to remain similar. <a href=\"https://t.co/7nm7Zyq94b\">https://t.co/7nm7Zyq94b</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1716872367631446288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe main change to the ‌iMac‌ will apparently be its processor, with the new machine featuring Apple's M3 chip. The current model has the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip and Gurman has repeatedly said that the ‌iMac‌ will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/\">skip the M2 chip entirely</a>. He previously remarked that he expects it to be \"one of the company's first M3-based machines.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman mentioned the new ‌iMac‌'s internally redesigned stand back in March, explaining that \"the computer will see some of its internal components relocated and redesigned, and the manufacturing process for attaching the ‌iMac‌'s stand is different.\" According to his latest comments, the internally redesigned stand remains on the new machine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current, M1-based ‌iMac‌ is available in green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver. In March, Gurman said that the new ‌iMac‌ was being tested in orange, pink, blue, and silver finishes. Gurman has now reiterated his claim that the color options of the new machine will remain \"similar,\" which suggests that there may still be some changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe next-generation ‌iMac‌ is otherwise expected to be the same as the current 24-inch model. Gurman's information indicates that the new ‌iMac‌ entered mass production sometime between June and August, suggesting that it is now ready to launch.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/next-gen-imac-details-rumored-ahead-of-event/\">Next-Generation iMac Chip, Stand, and Color Details Rumored Ahead of Apple Event</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-imac-chip-stand-and-color-details-rumored-ahead-of-apple-event.2408626/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e43badce6caea2b26c555723372cff7d5ead28effa82c45ec5b5b391229d1713","category":"Apple"}
