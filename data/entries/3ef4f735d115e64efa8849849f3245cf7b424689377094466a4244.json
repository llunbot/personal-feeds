With Live Activities, MLB users can follow their favorite teams without the need to open the app, keeping track of scores right from the Lock Screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/mlb-banner.jpg\" alt width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nOn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and Pro Max, scores can also be tracked through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>. After updating to the latest version of the app, users can choose the \"Track\" option from the list of games to add the up-to-date scoring to the Lock Screen and ‌Dynamic Island‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLive Activities for MLB games was already offered through Apple's own TV app, but until this week, the MLB app itself did not support the feature. Live Activities have been available for third-party apps since the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-16-1-features/\">November release of iOS 16.1</a>. Given that the MLB partners with Apple for content, it is not clear why it took so long for the feature to be implemented.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/live-activities-mlb-app.jpg\" alt width=\"1170\" height=\"478\" /><div><em>Image via MacRumors reader <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disappointed-in-lack-of-live-activities.2380427/?post=32021969#post-32021969\">jedimasterkyle</a></em></div>\r<br />\nThe MLB app was updated for the 2023 season yesterday, and in addition to Live Activities support, the app now includes a new onboarding experience, a Watch tab with 24/7 programming available, 2023 team schedules and tickets, a refreshed standings page, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe MLB app can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free, but unlocking all content will require a subscription.
