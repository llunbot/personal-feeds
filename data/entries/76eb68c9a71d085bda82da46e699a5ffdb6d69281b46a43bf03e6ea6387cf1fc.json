The shuttle remained attached to the Space Station for nearly two weeks, but when the orbiter departed, it left Reisman behind for an extended stay.</p>\n<p>During his time at the station, Reisman would often pass through the Harmony module, which serves as a corridor connecting laboratory modules built by NASA and the European and Japanese space agencies. Sometimes, he would look up and see a small placard that said, \"To CAM.\" The arrow, however, pointed out into space.</p>\n<p>\"When I was up there on the space station, there was still the sign that says, 'To CAM,'\" Reisman said in an interview. \"But there's just a closed hatch. It was tragic. It was just kind of taunting me when I saw that because I think that could have been one of the most important scientific discoveries that we made.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954271#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954271&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"76eb68c9a71d085bda82da46e699a5ffdb6d69281b46a43bf03e6ea6387cf1fc","category":"Tech"}
