{"title":"Did TikTok Swing the Election to Trump?","link":"https://politicalwire.com/2025/03/19/did-tiktok-swing-the-election-to-trump/","date":1742412173000,"content":"\n<p>Taegan Goddard, writing at Political Wire regarding <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-david-shor.html\">pollster David Shor’s appearance on Ezra Klein’s podcast</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>His surveys indicate a clear causal relationship: People who\nrelied on TikTok for news were much more likely to swing toward\nTrump than those who got their information from TV. His most\nstriking data point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you zoom in on people who get their news from TikTok but\ndon’t care very much about politics, this group is eight\npercentage points more Republican than they were four years ago — which is a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What remains unclear is why this shift happened. Was TikTok’s\nparent company, ByteDance, subtly adjusting its algorithm to\nundermine Democrats? Or was the platform simply reflecting broader\nanti-incumbent sentiment? Shor concedes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is\ngoing to do really well on TikTok, and Democrats are going to do\ngreat now. I don’t really know. But I think that, for whatever\nreason, this major shift really helped Republicans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It used to be that getting your message out required persuading\nreporters, editors, and gatekeepers — people trained to vet and\nverify information.</p>\n\n<p>Now anyone can make a short video, and if it’s compelling enough,\nit spreads like wildfire — except that it may be following a path\npredetermined by TikTok’s algorithms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I worry that the liberal/left response to this will be to declare, with exasperation, that people shouldn’t be getting their news or forming their political opinions by what they see on TikTok. You need to meet people where they are, and craft messages for the media they consume.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/did-tiktok-swing-the-election-to-trump\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8ceef7eb4c9f08589cf9c4b85a3f0285e2b781434b07e5ac2e0efbbfda78bdcc","category":"Tech"}
