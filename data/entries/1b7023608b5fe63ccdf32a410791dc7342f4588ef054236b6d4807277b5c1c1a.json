At this point it’s unclear what issues, if any, the update fixes. Macworld hasn’t heard of a single bug with the device, so it’s unlikely that Apple was pushed into the update by bad PR; it seems more likely to be a routine release with minor tweaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>The first update for the USB-C Apple Pencil is out!<br /><br />Interestingly, it's labeled as \"Apple Pencil Gen 3\"<br /><br />Version: 35347.35347.16<br />Build: 10M5164</p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1724514768571019574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2138870-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">November 14, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a small thing, but fellow Apple nerds may share my enjoyment of a quirk in the labeling of the update. It’s called “Apple Pencil Gen 3 Firmware,” even though Apple never publicly uses that generational label for the device itself. In the original <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-introduces-new-apple-pencil-bringing-more-value-and-choice-to-the-lineup/&amp;xcust=1-1-2138870-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, the company kept calling it the “new Apple Pencil”–shades there of the notoriously confusing “new iPad” branding from 2012–while the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2138870-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/select-apple-pencil\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Store</a> calls it “Apple Pencil (USB-C).”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/11/14/apple-pencil-usb-c-gets-its-first-firmware-update&amp;xcust=1-1-2138870-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AppleInsider</a> observes, the naming conventions will only become an issue if and when the company releases another premium model with a full feature set. At that point, does Apple admit <em>this</em> was the third Pencil and call that the 4th-gen? Or act as if this was only ever a stopgap? The new software’s label suggests that the former may now be more likely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing new firmware on an Apple Pencil isn’t a procedure you really “do” in any kind of manual sense, but if you connect your 3rd-gen/USB-C Pencil to a powered-on iPad it should grab the new software without any further user intervention.</p>\n\niPad, Tablet Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1b7023608b5fe63ccdf32a410791dc7342f4588ef054236b6d4807277b5c1c1a","category":"Apple"}
