Imagine how much more you could get done if your project management software didn’t make you want to throw your computer out a window. Shortcut is the ideal solution for task management, bug tracking, iteration planning, and reporting. Whether you’re in a startup that iterates quickly by providing every engineer with a free pallet of Red Bull, or in a large organization that has strict ship dates to hit, delight the scrum gods and give Shortcut a try. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/01/shortcut\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"96ad7b6bbbaeb0e6f269d75682f12342533b3513e91686dd7e7fde43e93cb0ed","category":"Tech"}
