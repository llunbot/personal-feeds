{"title":"Rumor: Apple Watch Series 7 to Come in Larger 41mm and 45mm Sizes","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/24/apple-watch-series-7-case-sizes-increase/","date":1629816032000,"content":"The upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 will come in larger 41mm and 45mm case sizes, replacing the current 40mm and 44m options offered since the Apple Watch Series 4, according to a leaker on popular Chinese platform Weibo.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/prosser-apple-watch-series-7.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe account sharing the information goes by UnclePan, who has shared information regarding Apple's plans in the past. According to <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5367283758/KuNKke9zr\">a post from the leaker this week</a>, the upcoming Series 7 will be offered in 41mm and 45mm case sizes. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUp until the Apple Watch Series 4, Apple had offered 38mm and 42mm case sizes. With the Series 4 in 2018, which included a larger display, the case sizes got larger with 40mm and 44mm options, replacing the older sizes. A hallmark feature of the Apple Watch that has carried through each generation has been compatibility with older Apple watch bands.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince the Series 4, all Apple Watch bands have been compatible across each generation for the same case size. According to the leaker, this will still be the case with the Apple Watch Series 7, allowing bands designed for 40mm and 44mm Apple Watches to work with the newer 41mm and 45mm sizes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe increase in case sizing is not entirely surprising, as the upcoming Apple Watch is expected to feature smaller bezels and a flat-edged design, allowing for a greater surface area of the display. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Apple leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a>, beyond an updated flat-edged design with a larger display, the Apple Watch Series 7 will be offered in a new green case color. Prosser, earlier in May, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">shared renders</a> of what the upcoming Apple Watch could look like.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to be announced alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> at a digital Apple Event next month. In the coming months, other new products we're expecting include new iPads, updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, a high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and redesigned MacBook Pros. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/24/apple-watch-series-7-case-sizes-increase/\">Rumor: Apple Watch Series 7 to Come in Larger 41mm and 45mm Sizes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-apple-watch-series-7-to-come-in-larger-41mm-and-45mm-sizes.2308514/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sz2KIC5JkE4:8MuhHPKe_Oo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sz2KIC5JkE4:8MuhHPKe_Oo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/sz2KIC5JkE4\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"54494bd0715bfe4103e07713e22dc643ac1af05397ab06bdac2f3dc72aba4ddc","category":"Apple"}
