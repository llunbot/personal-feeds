This is a fairly thick material that’s usually combined with a metal valve stem and usually available in a huge range of sizes to suit all types of bikes. Butyl tubes range from budget options to premium quality and lightweight models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Latex tubes used to be the gold standard in racing, formerly used as a lightweight tube inside tubular tyres for road and cyclocross racing. They’ve since been usurped by featherweight TPU tubes in terms of weight, but remain a more favourable option in terms of minimising rolling resistance. The downside of latex as an inner tube material is that it is slightly more porous, so you may find that you lose pressure between each ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TPU tubes have become widely available in recent years, which stands for Thermoplastic Polyurethane. These tend to be much thinner than butyl tubes, resulting in a lightweight and compact tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which is the best material for inner tubes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best material, or type of tube, largely depends on what you are prioritising. If budget is your number one concern, then you can’t go wrong with a standard butyl tube. If you’re looking for the most lightweight or compact option possible, then TPU is likely to be your best bet. And if rolling resistance is at the top of your inner tube agenda, then latex could be a wise option, although a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless tyre</a> has still lower rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each material has its pros and cons, so you’ll need to weigh up which is best for you or experiment with a few different types. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which valve type do I need, schrader or presta?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most road and gravel bikes these days run on presta style valves, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-mini-pump\" target=\"_blank\">mini pumps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-track-pumps\" target=\"_blank\">track pumps</a> that work accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schrader valves tend to be more commonly found on older-style mountain bikes and some hybrids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schwalbe has also pioneered a new type, which it calls the Clik valve, designed to eliminate niggles associated with presta valves. This can be used with any pump with the addition of a pump adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why are there different valve length options?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll notice that some tubes are available with different length valve options, for example 48mm, 60mm and 80mm. These longer valves are for accommodating mid-section and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">deep-section wheels</a>, as the valve needs to be longer to not only travel through the wheel’s rim, but also to leave enough exposed for inflation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your tube’s valve isn’t long enough, you can use a valve extender. This can be a really handy piece of kit to carry if you run aero wheels, allowing you to convert standard tubes into ones that you can use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that your spare inner tube has a long enough valve to extend through your wheel rim and allow you to fit a pump!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can you repair punctured inner tubes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, mostly! <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/the-cyclist-guide-to-inner-tube-repair\" target=\"_blank\">Repairing a punctured inner tube</a> is one of cycling’s fundamental skills, whether that’s using a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-puncture-repair-kits\" target=\"_blank\">glue and patch kit</a> or opting for stick-on patches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complications arise when punctures are close to the valve, or particularly large – in this case, the tube may not be able to be patched effectively. In that case, remember that old inner tubes can be useful for all sorts of things, including chainstay frame protection and on workstand clamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that most TPU tubes need to be patched using TPU-specific kits, so you’ll need to make sure you are kitted out with those if you’re opting to run TPU tubes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are tubes with removable valve cores better?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Often more expensive tubes are kitted out with removable valve cores. This means that if you have an issue with the valve core, for example the tip gets snapped off while inflating the tube, then you can simply replace it with the valve core from another tube, without having to ditch the whole tube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheaper designs often don’t have a removable valve core, as well as some models that are designed to minimise weight.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do I make sure I buy the right inner tube?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve still got questions about finding the right model for you, check out our <a href=\"https://cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-cyclist-guide-to-buying-the-right-inner-tube\" target=\"_blank\">guide to buying the right inner tube</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-sealant\">Best tubeless sealant for road and gravel bike tyres</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-cyclist-guide-to-buying-the-right-inner-tube\">What size inner tube do I need?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-change-bike-tyre-inner-tube-without-levers\">Watch: How to change a tyre and inner tube without levers like a pro</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-multitool\">Best cycling multitools: Buyer’s guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-inner-tubes\">Best inner tubes 2024 reviewed: TPU, latex and butyl tubes for road and gravel cycling rated</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0e38ac5b54b7813a5f4500be7326b41f513c2ba395e9402a1aaa6800f8dae01a","category":"Cycling"}
