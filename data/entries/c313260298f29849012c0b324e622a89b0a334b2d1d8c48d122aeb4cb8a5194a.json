Both accessories are no longer available to order on Apple's online store, with the product listings completely removed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/magsafe-purple.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBoth the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger were equipped with a Lightning port, so it is not too surprising that they were discontinued after Apple introduced four new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-and-15-plus/\">iPhone 15 models with USB-C ports</a>. Last year, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had predicted that the MagSafe Battery Pack <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">would transition to USB-C</a> eventually, but it's unclear if that will ever happen or if the accessory has been retired for good.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased in 2021, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ was priced at $99 and attaches magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 and newer, providing hours of additional battery life. Meanwhile, the MagSafe Duo was a $129 foldable charging mat with both a MagSafe charger for iPhones and an Apple Watch magnetic charging puck.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did release some other new USB-C accessories, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/\">updated AirPods Pro and EarPods</a>, while the Apple TV's Siri Remote <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-tv-remote-usb-c-port/\">gained a USB-C port last year</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/\">Apple Discontinues MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-magsafe-duo-charger.2401280/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c313260298f29849012c0b324e622a89b0a334b2d1d8c48d122aeb4cb8a5194a","category":"Apple"}
