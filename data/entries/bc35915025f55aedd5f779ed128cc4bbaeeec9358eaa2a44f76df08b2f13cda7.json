Canyon, photo by Rupert Fowler</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When Canyon launched the lightweight carbon <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-spectralon-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectral:ON CFR last year</a> they set in motion an overall modernization of their aggressive off-road mountain ebike family – rounded out last week by the all-new enduro <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-striveon-cfr-carbon-enduro-race-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Strive:ON</a> and freeride <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-striveon-enduro-torqueon-grand-canyon-fill-out-canyon-emtb-line/\" target=\"_blank\">Torque:ON</a>. But while the 2022 Spectral:ON bumped its rear-wheel travel up to 155mm and boosted battery capacities up to 900Wh, its forks stayed at 150mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested the small Spectral:ON CFR ebike (which is limited to a 720Wh internal battery) and came away hoping for more travel and more confidence up front. And just a little bit concerned with Shimano EP8 motor rattle while coasting…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well for 2023, Canyon has addressed most of our concerns – with more travel and an upgraded drive motor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Spectral:ON all-mountain ebike upgraded eMTB, 160mm travel forks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_160mm-travel-forks.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The newly updated ebike gets bumped up to eMTB-rated 160mm forks “for more confidence and stability on aggressive trails” (on most models). The 2022 ebike was already technically rated for 160mm up front. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry-800x444.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Spectral:ON all-mountain ebike upgraded eMTB, updated geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_updated-geometry.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But now that the new Spectral:ONs come straight from Canyon that way, they’ll all benefit from slacking out the headtube about a half a degree – to 65°. Paired to 155mm out back, we feel like this is a better balance for the all-mountain versatility of the Spectral:ON.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Spectral:ON all-mountain ebike upgraded eMTB, EP801 motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-SpectralON-all-mountain-ebike-upgraded-eMTB_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_EP8-motor.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Rupert Fowler</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, it also gets upgraded to the latest Shimano EP8 series EP801 motor – the same one we tested with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-emtb-autoshift-freeshift-stuns-powered-by-linkglide-xt-di2-review/\">eMTB AutoShift &amp; FreeShift</a>, which curiously is not included here, even though the Di2-equipped model appears to have the hardware to make FreeShift work. Anyway, the new EP801 does deliver a bit more peak power output at a claimed 600W (up from 500W for EP800). And as important, it thankfully seems to get rid of the internal rattle that rattled us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All-new GPS tracking &amp; smartphone Canyon App</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"All-new My Canyon App, GPS tracking &amp; free How-To smartphone mobile phone application, anti-theft\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/All-new-My-Canyon-App_GPS-tracking-and-free-how-to-smartphone-mobile-phone-application_GPS-tracking.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But while the fork &amp; motor updates improve on what was already there, the new connected GPS tracker and companion Canyon App bring out all-new functionality, now tucked inside the 2023 Spectral:ON.

Its primary function is the additional security of anti-theft bike location tracking – these top-tier ebikes can cost over 10k€ after all.
