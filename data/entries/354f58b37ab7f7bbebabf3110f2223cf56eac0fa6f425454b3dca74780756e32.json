About 80 million Americans eligible vaccination have yet to receive the free and readily available shots. Meanwhile, delta has spread across the country like wildfire since June, leading to one of the largest COVID-19 surges yet in the pandemic. Currently, the US is seeing nearly 150,000 new cases every day, with 100,000 hospitalizations and over 1,500 daily deaths—almost all of which are preventable with vaccination.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793826#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793826&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"354f58b37ab7f7bbebabf3110f2223cf56eac0fa6f425454b3dca74780756e32","category":"Tech"}
