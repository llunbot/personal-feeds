T-Mobile acknowledged the problem and said it is being fixed.</p>\n<p>Gurman experienced the problem himself when he traded in an iPhone 12 Pro Max for an iPhone 13 Pro Max. He was promised a $790 credit from Apple for trading in his year-old iPhone \"plus $500 in bill credits over several months\" from T-Mobile. Getting the trade-in credit from Apple was quick and easy, but T-Mobile denied rebate requests from Gurman and people who made similar iPhone upgrades.</p>\n<p>Gurman submitted the iPhone rebate request to T-Mobile on September 27 and received T-Mobile's rejection last week. In the replies to Gurman's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1465449845674676233\">tweet</a> showing a screenshot of the rejection notice, about 20 other people reported getting similar denials from T-Mobile.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818359#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818359&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8da2ba81f8e0158f26496b56587d72d2ef4af008cffdbcaf39d1661701b0e306","category":"Tech"}
