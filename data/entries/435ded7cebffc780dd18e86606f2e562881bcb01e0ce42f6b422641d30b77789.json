Later, it came up with a way to save some money by implementing an Apple Savings account within Apple Card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To complete the circle, you can use money in your Apple Savings to make Apple Card payments.

Here are the instructions on how to set up Apple Card to take payments from Apple Savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232603/apple-card-faq-rewards-payments-interest-rates.html\">guide to the Apple Card</a> if you want to learn more about the credit card.
