The bear had at least 13 adult parasitic worms pulled from its eyes, and the researchers identified them as the invasive, potentially blinding species <em>Thelazia callipaeda</em>, which was only first detected in the US in 2020.</p>\n<p>The bear's infection shows that the worm is rapidly expanding both its range of potential hosts as well as its geographic foothold in the US. In all, the finding \"implicates exposure and risk for transmission to threatened and endangered species and direct or indirect risk for transmission to humans and domestic animals,\" write the researchers, led by veterinary experts at the University of Pennsylvania.
