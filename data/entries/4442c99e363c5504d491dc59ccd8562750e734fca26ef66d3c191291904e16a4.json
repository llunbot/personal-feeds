They’re a great company with a great product.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an uncomfortable fact: at most companies, employees can download sensitive company data onto any device, keep it there forever, and never even know that they’re doing something wrong. Kolide’s new report, <a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3I7025A\">The State of Sensitive Data</a>, addresses this issue head-on.</p>\n\n<p>Kolide offers a more nuanced approach than MDM solutions to setting and enforcing sensitive data policies. Their premise is simple: if an employee’s device is out of compliance, it can’t access your apps. Kolide lets admins run queries to detect sensitive data, flag devices that have violated policies, and enforce OS and browser updates so vulnerable devices aren’t accessing data.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3XlSqAq\">Visit Kolide’s website</a> to learn more and see it in action.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/25/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4442c99e363c5504d491dc59ccd8562750e734fca26ef66d3c191291904e16a4","category":"Tech"}
