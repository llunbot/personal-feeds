It’s hard to comment on how breathable these are given that the weather has recently become rather cold and wet in Scotland. Though we’ve seen nothing to suggest a lack of durability so far, we prefer the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/03/18/review-specialized-rime-flats-are-the-ultimate-session-shoe-for-mountain-biking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Specialized Rime</a> for muddy UK trail conditions due to its EXPEL mesh liner, a lightweight water-repellent fabric.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber.jpg\" alt=\"specialized 2fo roost canvas review gen3 slipnot rubber\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115457/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-slip-not-rubber-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Specialized 2FO Roost Canvas performs just as well as the original 2FO Roost thanks to the SlipNot rubber sole, now in its 3rd generation. We’ve tested this sole with a range of flat pedals, including OneUp Aluminium pedals, Crankbrothers Stamp 3 Pedals and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/10/06/new-scottish-made-pinnd-cs2-pedals-with-titanium-axle-have-no-rider-weight-limit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PINND CS2 Pedals</a>, rating the grip best when paired with the latter.

The heel portion feels deep enough such that the heel feels secure. The mid-sole is cushioned with EVA foam for a bit of added comfort on and off the bike. The sole offers a decent bit of flex to allow the wearer’s foot to sink into the pedal’s concavity, also offering good feedback on the bike’s ride feel. I prefer this more flexible sole over the stiffer sole on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/03/11/review-specialized-2fo-roost-dh-mtb-shoes-stick-the-landing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2FO DH</a> shoe tested previously.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review.jpg\" alt=\"specialized 2fo roost canvas review \" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26115427/specialized-2fo-roost-canvas-flat-pedal-mtb-shoe-review-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The 2FO Roost Canvas is offered in a lace closure version only; there is an elasticated tab on the tongue handy for tucking excess lace into.</p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>The Specialized 2FO Roost Canvas is available now from Specialized dealers worldwide in sizes 36-49, retailing at $120 USD.
