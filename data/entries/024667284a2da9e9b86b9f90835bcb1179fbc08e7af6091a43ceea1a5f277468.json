Currently, there are still some Android TV boxes on the market, but Google <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/09/30/android-tv-replaced-google-tv-update/\">reportedly plans</a> to phase out the \"Android TV\" brand by 2022, in favor of using Google TV branding everywhere. Google TV is the next version of Android TV.</p>\n<p>Google TV's flagship feature is the new home screen, which is designed around a content-recommendation engine. Instead of the usual grid of streaming app icons, Google TV displays the shows themselves on the home screen, prioritizing what matters—the content—and deprioritizing which service it comes from. The problem with Google TV's recommendation approach is that the system has gone a full year without profile support, so every user of the TV affects the single list of recommended content.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803377#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803377&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"024667284a2da9e9b86b9f90835bcb1179fbc08e7af6091a43ceea1a5f277468","category":"Tech"}
