{"title":"Daring Fireball Sponsorship Openings","link":"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/","date":1693272032000,"content":"\n<p>I can’t explain it, but while most of the remaining sponsorship weeks for the year  are sold, three of the next four are open — <s>including this very week</s>. All months are good months, but September is a particularly busy month covering Apple, traditionally. So if you’ve got a product or service you’d like to promote to DF’s discerning audience, <a href=\"mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship\">get in touch</a>. And if you’re willing and able to jump on this very week’s opening, I’m sure we can work out a deal.</p>\n\n<p>In related news, there are more openings than usual on the sponsorship schedule for The Talk Show for the next quarter. Similar audience, of course, but a lower price. If you’ve ever thought to yourself, “Maybe <em>we</em> should sponsor Gruber’s podcast...” you should get in touch with my colleagues <a href=\"http://neat.fm/\">at Neat FM</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/daring-fireball-sponsorship-openings\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1a0b3e5b8e08d2334a09e00189e4c7adab988c85762b991aacc1a50e275cb16e","category":"Tech"}
