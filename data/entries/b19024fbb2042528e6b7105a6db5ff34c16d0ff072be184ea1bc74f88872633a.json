Katie Porter (D-CA) when\nI talked to her on Sunday were: “Can you believe we have to talk\nabout this shit again?” She was referring to a conversation we had\nin 2018, when she was still just a financial expert and a\ncandidate for Congress, about <a href=\"https://www.rpc.senate.gov/legislative-notices/s-2155-the-economic-growth-regulatory-relief-and-consumer-protection-act\">S.2155</a>, which I call the\nCrapo bill, a reference to its co-author (Idaho Republican Sen.\nMike Crapo) and its underlying contents. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The most important part of the Crapo bill was Section 401, which\nincreased by fivefold the threshold for enhanced regulatory\nstandards, from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion. Silicon\nValley Bank’s CEO, Greg Becker, <a href=\"https://www.levernews.com/svb-chief-pressed-lawmakers-to-weaken-bank-risk-regs/\">lobbied explicitly</a> for this\nchange. It meant that banks under $250 billion would not be\nsubject to additional stress tests and heightened capital and\nliquidity requirements. SVB topped out <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23016.html\">around $200 billion</a>,\nafter growing rapidly in the past few years. [...]</p>\n\n<p>So you have depositors that either didn’t know the first thing\nabout risk management, or were bribed by the bank into neglecting\nit. And you have a bank that didn’t have a chief risk officer for\nclose to a year, that put their entire risk management on\nautopilot and got blindsided by interest rate–fueled losses.\n“Interest rates do two things, they go up and down. SVB did not\nforesee and manage properly that inevitable thing,” Porter said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/13/porter-svb\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b19024fbb2042528e6b7105a6db5ff34c16d0ff072be184ea1bc74f88872633a","category":"Tech"}
