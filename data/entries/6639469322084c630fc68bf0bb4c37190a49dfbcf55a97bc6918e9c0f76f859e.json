These are the first countries where Apple offers refurbished Series 9 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" />\r<br />\nAvailability will likely extend to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-series-9\">Japan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-series-9\">the UK</a> soon, as Apple recently added a grayed-out Apple Watch Series 9 search filter to its refurbished store in those countries. The search filter is only visible on these pages in a desktop browser, and it is possible that Apple will remove them following our report, as it has done in the past.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to begin selling refurbished Apple Watch Ultra 2 models anywhere.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if and when refurbished Series 9 and Ultra 2 models will be available in the U.S. due to Apple's legal battle with health company Masimo. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/\">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with a functioning Blood Oxygen app after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents. Apple recently appealed the decision <a href=\"https://ipfray.com/apples-opening-brief-in-appeal-of-watch-case-places-emphasis-on-itcs-domestic-industry-requirement/\">in a 916-page court filing</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could opt to sell refurbished Series 9 and Ultra 2 models in the U.S. with the Blood Oxygen app deactivated, as it is currently doing for brand new models. Apple would be able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/\">reactivate the app with a watchOS update</a> if its appeal is successful, or if it eventually reaches a settlement with Masimo to end the dispute.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the ITC's ruling applies to the U.S. only, the Blood Oxygen app is still functional on new and refurbished Apple Watch models sold in all other countries.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/refurbished-apple-watch-series-9-internationally/\">Apple Watch Series 9 Now Available on Apple's Refurbished Store in Select Countries</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-now-available-on-apples-refurbished-store-in-select-countries.2423866/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6639469322084c630fc68bf0bb4c37190a49dfbcf55a97bc6918e9c0f76f859e","category":"Apple"}
