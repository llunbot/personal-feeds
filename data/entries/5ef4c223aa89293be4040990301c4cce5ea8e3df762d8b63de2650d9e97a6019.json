{"title":"First Look Inside iPhone 13 Reveals Revamped TrueDepth System, Smaller Taptic Engine, and Larger Battery","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/iphone-13-images-taptic-engine-larger-battery/","date":1632395350000,"content":"New images offering us our first real-world look inside the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> have revealed a smaller Taptic Engine, a larger battery, and revamped components of the TrueDepth camera system.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-13-mini-teardown.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup will start arriving at customers on Friday, a week after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/iphone-13-models-now-available-for-pre-order/\">pre-orders went live</a>. While a more professional teardown of the device will be shared online in the coming days and weeks, occasional leaker Sonny Dickson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1440861572482551812?s=20\">has shared on Twitter images</a> that offers us our first look inside of the ‌iPhone 13‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the images, which are likely to depict an ‌iPhone 13‌ or ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, Apple has made the Taptic Engine smaller on this year's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> compared to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>. The size reduction was likely part of Apple's effort to free up internal space to make room for a larger battery. Apple boasts that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-models-battery-life/\">iPhone 13 has significantly improved battery life</a> compared to last year's ‌iPhone‌ due to the efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and a physically larger battery, which the images confirm.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-13-internal-images-notch.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the ‌iPhone 13‌, Apple has made <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-models-notch-taller/\">the notch 20% smaller</a> after years of remaining the same size. To have achieved the smaller notch, the images highlight that Apple had to move the front-facing camera to the left side of the TrueDepth camera system while moving the dot projector and infrared camera to the right side. The images also show the earpiece moved to the top bezel, further enabling a smaller notch. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile there are likely other internal changes, we'll have to wait for a more professional teardown of the device, such as those done annually by iFixit, to learn more.
