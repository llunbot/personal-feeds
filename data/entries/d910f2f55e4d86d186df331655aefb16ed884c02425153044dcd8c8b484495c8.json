Indeed, SPD cleats are known to extremely long-lasting.</p>\n<p>The Ti cleats have an internal hollow lattice structure which the brand claims helps maintain stiffness and strength.</p>\n<p>The combination of this structure and the titanium reduces the cleats weight to a claimed half that of a standard cleat set.</p>\n<p>Silca says the weight saving is 25-30g per set of cleats, so ideal if you are looking to shave off some grams, but a small gram per dollar saving if you're counting.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/407392-silca-shimano-cleats-blue-shoes-df0cb5-large-1637059197.jpeg?itok=108VJ2_O\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/9947/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100-shimano-finally-goes-12-speed\">Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 and Ultegra R8100: Shimano finally goes 12-speed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/1671/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\">Buyer's guide to road bike groupsets </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/shimano/1391/shimano-dura-ace-9100-groupset-review\">Shimano Dura-Ace 9100 groupset review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/677/gifts-for-cyclists\">Best gifts for cyclists: presents for the cyclist in your life</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe new cleats are available for Shimano SPD, Crankbrothers and Time ATAC pedals.</p>\n<p>With a price tag of $85, these 3D-printed cleats don't come cheap but if they last as long as Silca says they will, then they could be a worthy investment.
