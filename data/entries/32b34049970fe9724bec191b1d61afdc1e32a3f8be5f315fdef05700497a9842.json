The outbreak, which began in late May, has sickened a total of 34 people across 13 states, leading to 33 hospitalizations, <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/boars-head-provisions-co--expands-recall-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due\">according to the US Department of Agriculture</a>.</p>\n<p>On June 26, Boar's Head recalled 207,528 pounds of products, including liverwurst, beef bologna, ham, salami, and \"heat and eat\" bacon. On Tuesday, the Jarratt, Virginia-based company expanded the recall to include about 7 million additional pounds of meat, including <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/food_label_pdf/2024-07/Recall-023-2024-EXP-Labels.pdf\">71 different products</a> sold on the Boar's Head and Old Country brand labels. The products were sold nationwide.</p>\n<p>The meats may be contaminated with <em>Listeria monocytogenes, </em>a foodborne pathogen that is particularly dangerous to pregnant people, people over the age of 65, and people with compromised immune systems. Infections during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or a life-threatening infection in newborns. For others who develop invasive illness, the fatality rate is nearly 16 percent. Symptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions that are sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040456#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040456&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32b34049970fe9724bec191b1d61afdc1e32a3f8be5f315fdef05700497a9842","category":"Tech"}
