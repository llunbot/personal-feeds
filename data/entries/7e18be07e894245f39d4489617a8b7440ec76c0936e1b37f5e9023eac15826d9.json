{"title":"Facebook on NFTs: Never Mind","link":"https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=meta-pulls-the-plug-on-nfts","date":1678834509000,"content":"\n<p>Molly White:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/skasriel/status/1635386565487898624\">In a Twitter thread</a>, Meta (formerly Facebook) Head of Commerce\nand Fintech Stephane Kasriel announced that they would be “down\ndigital collectibles (NFTs) for now to focus on other ways to\nsupport creators, people, and businesses”. Meta had only launched\nits support for NFTs in Facebook and Instagram partway through\nlast year — a bit late to the NFT craze, which had largely cooled\nby that point.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg had once talked about eventually using NFTs for\nMeta’s metaverse projects, suggesting that eventually “the\nclothing that your avatar is wearing in the metaverse, you know,\n[could] be basically minted as an NFT and you can take it\nbetween your different places”. It sounds like that plan may no\nlonger be on the table now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/14/facebook-nfts-never-mind\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e18be07e894245f39d4489617a8b7440ec76c0936e1b37f5e9023eac15826d9","category":"Tech"}
