This is a tablet-style foldable with a 7.82-inch, 120 Hz, 2440×2268 OLED display on the inside and a 6.31-inch, 120 Hz, 2484×1116 OLED on the front.</p>\n<p>Size and weight are a big concern for foldables since they are a lot to carry around and fit into a pocket. OnePlus is tackling that with a very impressive 239 g weigh-in—that's less than an iPhone 14 Pro Max, which sets a high point for slab phones at 240 g. On the heavier end of foldables, we have the Pixel Fold, which has a smaller screen (7.6 inches) yet weighs 283 g. The OnePlus Open is 11.7 mm thick when folded up, another impressively compact number for foldables compared to the Pixel Fold (12.1 mm) and Galaxy Fold 4 (15.8 mm).</p>\n<p>The battery hasn't been sacrificed to hit these compact numbers, either. At 4805 mAh, it's on par with the Pixel Fold and more than the Galaxy Fold 4 (4400 mAh). Of course, because this is a OnePlus device, it will charge faster than most other foldables, with proprietary 67 W \"SuperVOOC\" charging. Foldables can burn down their battery pretty quickly, but that's less of a concern when the battery charges from 1 to 100 percent in 42 minutes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976948#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976948&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51e77c516c508d39e0b3a497e14173264844c5b88168303eeae4d507716f2467","category":"Tech"}
