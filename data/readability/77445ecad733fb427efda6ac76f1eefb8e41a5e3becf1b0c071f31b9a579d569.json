If you’ve managed to steer clear of all the recent talk of NFTs, the simple answer is that it’s a one-of-a-kind digital item that only one person can own. These NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are popping up as everything from cartoon apes to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/06/colnago-peddles-the-blockchain-with-special-edition-c64-nft-1-of-1-digital-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colnago road bikes</a>. Now, with Bike Club NFT, 10,000 of these unique Rider avatars will be minted as access to an exclusive club with real-world benefits.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14233515/bike-club-nft-avatar-teasers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14233515/bike-club-nft-avatar-teasers.jpg\" alt=\"Bike Club NFT Rider Avatar by Rich Mitch\" width=\"1200\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14233515/bike-club-nft-avatar-teasers.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14233515/bike-club-nft-avatar-teasers-297x128.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14233515/bike-club-nft-avatar-teasers-800x345.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14233515/bike-club-nft-avatar-teasers-120x52.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14233515/bike-club-nft-avatar-teasers-768x331.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>According to the Bike Club NFT Roadmap, the plan is to mint 10,000 unique ‘Rider’ avatars in 2022.

According to Bike Club, <em>“We firmly believe that the future of community, gaming, social media, and commerce is being built on the blockchain. Bike Club is leaning into this future by digitally recreating the strong cycling culture we all enjoy, allowing free and open communication between brands, athletes, events, and riders while creating massive value for everyone involved.”</em></p><p>That includes a host of benefits not limited to private groups and channels on social media, a Strava Club, and exclusive access to events, product deals, giveaways, product launches, and even athletes and industry leaders. Bike Club already has a <a href=\"https://bikeclub.io/#brands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pretty solid list</a> of big-name brands that are on board, likely with more to follow.</p><p><em>“The Bike Club roadmap includes IRL rides with pros, VIP experiences at major events (think Sea Otter, Unbound, BWR, etc.), deliver hard-to-get race entries, and so much more. Pre-launch sneak peeks, exclusive pre-order opportunities, and special deals will provide ongoing value far, far beyond the initial mint price, delivering outsized value to every member.”</em></p><p>On top of that, Bike Club aims to donate 10% of all revenues to cycling-related charities and advocacy groups while allowing the Bike Club community to help decide which organizations will get the funds.</p><h2>Bike Club NFT Roadmap</h2><h3><strong>NEUTRAL START (pre-mint)</strong></h3><ul><li>Launch website and announce Bike Club to the world</li><li>Bike Club Discord server setup</li><li>Athlete &amp; Brand promo announcements</li><li>Contests, giveaways and promotions to earn prizes and whitelisting</li></ul><h3><strong>ROADMAP 1.0 – The Race Start</strong></h3><ul><li>Mint Day (currently planned for mid-January, 2022)</li><li>10% Sold – First Major Prize Giveaway</li><li>20% Sold – First $40,000 USD Charity Donation</li><li>30% Sold – Second Major Prize Giveaway</li><li>40% Sold – Second $40,000 USD Charity Donation</li><li>50% Sold – Third Major Prize Giveaway</li><li>60% Sold – Third $40,000 USD Charity Donation</li><li>70% Sold – Fourth Major Prize Giveaway</li><li>80% Sold – Fourth $40,000 Charity Donation</li><li>100% Sold – Fifth $40,000 Charity Donation &amp; Mega Giveaway!</li></ul><p>For now, Bike Club is in what they call the Neutral Start.
