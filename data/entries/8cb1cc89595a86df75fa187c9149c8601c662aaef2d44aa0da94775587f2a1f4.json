{"title":"Why I love Bandcamp: Waived-fee Fridays, solid app, no DRM, more","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785526","date":1628275453000,"content":"<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bandcampfriday-listing-800x366.png\" /><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bandcampfriday-listing.png\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> For the rest of 2021, Bandcamp Friday is back on the first Friday of every month (including today). That's one of many reasons I recommend checking out Bandcamp as a solid digital music storefront.

But getting music-subscription dollars into your favorite musicians' hands remains a sticking point.</p>\n<p>As far as musicians are concerned, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> is still one of the better payout services, with the company officially estimating <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-reveals-how-much-it-pays-when-you-stream-a-song-11618579800\">as much as one penny paid per streamed song</a>, while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/spotify/\">Spotify</a> maxes out at less than half a penny per streamâ€”and those payouts can drop based on whatever wacky spreadsheet-calculus each service runs in the background. Either way, that math checks out; your $10 or $15 per month can only be divided so far between hundreds of song streams.</p>\n<p>If you're willing to open your wallet a little wider for downloaded music, today's return of the <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-2021\">Bandcamp Fridays</a> promotion is a massive counterbalance to underpaying subscription services. And it's a good excuse to point to <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp</a> as a feature-rich, mobile-friendly option for buying music online.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785526#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785526&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8cb1cc89595a86df75fa187c9149c8601c662aaef2d44aa0da94775587f2a1f4","category":"Tech"}
