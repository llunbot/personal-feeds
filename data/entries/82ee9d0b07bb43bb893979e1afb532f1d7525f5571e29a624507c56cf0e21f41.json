This several-week delay alone is \"a clear sign that <em>something</em> is about to happen,\" says Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother reason leads the reporter to believe a Mac announcement will happen next week: Apple's earnings call is due to take place on Thursday, November 2. The last time the company posted its quarterly results in the month of November was in 2018, and that followed an October 30 launch event that saw new iPads and Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman reckons that the most likely Mac to be announced this month is a new 24-inch iMac. The current iMac has not been updated for more than 900 days, and it is the only remaining model in Apple's Mac lineup still using the M1 chip. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe also believes there is a chance we will see new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. This would be somewhat of a surprise, given that Apple only updated its premium MacBook Pros in January 2023. However, as Gurman notes, \"an additional update the same year would be unusual, but not inconceivable.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman's latest report reveals little about what improvements the new iMac will bring, but he has previously said that Apple's next iMac will leapfrog the M2 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/\">instead adopt the rumored new M3 chip</a>, bringing performance and efficiency improvements. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>NEW: Apple’s iMacs and MacBook Pros are in extremely short supply online and at retail stores. And new models may be coming soon: the company is likely planning a Mac related launch event at the end of this month. <a href=\"https://t.co/3xwhck5JBs\">https://t.co/3xwhck5JBs</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1716065994995900691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nAs for the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, Gurman said he does not expect any major changes other than new processors, but his latest report stops short on offering specifics. Gurman earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/\">claimed</a> that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models featuring M3 Pro and M3 Max chips would likely launch between early 2024 and the spring. Gurman may be hedging in his latest predictions, which is likely to lead to speculation that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/13/a12z-gpu-identical-to-a12x/\">iterative update</a> to the M2 Pro and M2 Max is coming this year instead.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman says the new MacBook Pro models could include \"minor improvements to displays.\" Notably, <em>DigiTimes</em> recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/new-14-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-2023/\">claimed</a> that Apple will release new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with more efficient mini-LED displays before the end of the year. <em>DigiTimes</em>' report was originally met with skepticism because of the alleged launch timing, but couched in terms of Gurman's latest predictions, there could well be more substance to it after all.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, <em>MacRumors</em> received information in early October indicating that Apple was preparing to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/\">accept some of its latest Mac models for trade-in</a>, suggesting it may be proceeding with plans to release new Mac models. Whether this correlates with the launch of at least one new machine in late October remains to be seen.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/\">Bloomberg: Apple Likely to Hold Mac Launch Event on October 30 or 31</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-apple-likely-to-hold-mac-launch-event-on-october-30-or-31.2408392/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82ee9d0b07bb43bb893979e1afb532f1d7525f5571e29a624507c56cf0e21f41","category":"Apple"}
