Silverado's top spec level now joins the lineup's previous fleet-only WT trim, meaning the general public can now purchase an enormous electric pickup that strongly resembles the Avalanche of 2001 to 2013. But despite any other similarities to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/the-hummer-ev-is-an-electric-truck-for-people-who-think-evs-are-stupid/\">the Hummer EV</a>, which shares a related chassis, or ICE trucks of old, the 2024 Silverado aims to change the game for GM's market positioning despite arriving a full <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/05/the-most-important-ev-of-the-decade-we-drive-the-f-150-lightning/4/\">24 months after Ford's F-150 Lightning</a>.</p>\n<p>With a large crew cab, a longer truck bed, and angular sail panels, the Silverado EV looks less boxy than GMC's Hummer EV. Aero gains thanks to the smoother design pair with lower rolling-resistance tires, allowing the Silverado to achieve an EPA range estimate of up to 450 miles (724 km), though the RST First Edition I recently drove over the course of a long day in Michigan earns a rating of 440 miles (708 km).</p>\n<p>On the highway, judging by wind noise around the cabin alone, the aerodynamic gains of the Silverado's styling seem to make a noticeable difference versus the Hummer. On the other hand, tire hum might cover up any aero deficiencies because the RST's single weirdest detail constantly occupies center stage here: a set of 24-inch wheels, the largest ever equipped to a car, truck, or SUV straight from the factory.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026203#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026203&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77aae22582ae8a4673eb67a551fc07066af37a450047938b4e2023caad7c3e05","category":"Tech"}
