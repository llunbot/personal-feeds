In addition to the fine, AT&amp;T agreed in a <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-892A1.pdf\">consent decree</a> announced today by the Federal Communications Commission to stricter controls on sharing data with vendors.</p>\n<p>In January 2023, years after the data was supposed to be destroyed, the vendor suffered a breach \"when threat actors accessed the vendor's cloud environment and ultimately exfiltrated AT&amp;T customer information,\" the FCC said. Information related to 8.9 million AT&amp;T wireless customers was exposed.</p>\n<p>Phone companies are required by law to protect customer information, and AT&amp;T should not have merely relied on third-party firms' assurances that they destroyed data when it was no longer needed, the FCC said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050523#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050523&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"754c3d4f3152d9407b5e7af13b7c5992dd39e9dd19db3d82144a5ebd0a93a83c","category":"Tech"}
