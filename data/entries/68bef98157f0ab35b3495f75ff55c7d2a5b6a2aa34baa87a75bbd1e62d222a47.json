According to reports <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/consumer-alert/article/i-think-its-sinful-to-hold-it-back-consumers-frustrated-apple-hearing-aid-feature-not-available-in-canada/\">from <em>CTV News</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/health-wellness/apple-s-airpods-hearing-aid-feature-is-available-in-106-countries-but-not-canada-here/article_76c5641a-0346-11f0-a88b-9fa7e7f24a0b.html\"><em>Toronto Star</em></a> this month, the features have yet to launch in Canada because regulations vary at the provincial level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aids.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn the most populous Canadian province of Ontario, for example, hearing aids require a prescription from a physician or an audiologist.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe good news is that Apple recently told the <em>Toronto Star</em> that it is working with Canadian provinces to get approval to release the AirPods hearing aid and hearing test features over the counter. Apple told the newspaper that it hopes to make the features available as soon as possible, but it did not provide a timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the clinical-grade hearing aid feature, AirPods Pro 2 can amplify the sound around you. The feature is intended for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, according to Apple. There is no additional cost to use the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the five-minute hearing test allows adults to identify if they have hearing loss by measuring their ability to hear different frequencies of sound. Afterwards, the results will show a hearing loss classification and recommended next steps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe two features first launched in the U.S. and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/feature-availability/\">select other countries</a> in late October, and they continue to roll out to more countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a third AirPods hearing health feature — hearing protection — that is available in Canada.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll three features require AirPods Pro 2.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/airpods-hearing-aid-feature-canada-update/\">Apple Provides Update on Expanding AirPods Hearing Aid Feature to Canada</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-provides-update-on-expanding-airpods-hearing-aid-feature-to-canada.2453424/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"68bef98157f0ab35b3495f75ff55c7d2a5b6a2aa34baa87a75bbd1e62d222a47","category":"Apple"}
