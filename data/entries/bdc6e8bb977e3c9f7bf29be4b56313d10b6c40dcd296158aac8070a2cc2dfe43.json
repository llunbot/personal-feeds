The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we recap what to expect from the Messages app on iOS 18.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>RCS Support</h2>\r<br />\nLast year, Apple announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/\">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS (Rich Communication Services)</a> in the Messages app starting \"later\" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li>\r<br />\n <li>Audio messages</li>\r<br />\n <li>Typing indicators</li>\r<br />\n <li>Read receipts</li>\r<br />\n <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li>\r<br />\n <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese features are already available for iMessage conversations with blue bubbles, and RCS will extend the capabilities to green bubbles over both Wi-Fi and cellular networks. It is expected that SMS will remain available as a fallback option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Per-Word Effects</h2>\r<br />\nApple plans to add a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-imessage-text-effects/\">per-word text effects option</a> to the Messages app on iOS 18, multiple sources familiar with the matter told <em>MacRumors</em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile it is already possible to send iMessages with entire-bubble or full-screen effects, such as invisible ink or confetti, the text effects would allow you to animate individual words within a message. Our hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options, but we have not confirmed that possibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Suggested Replies</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18 will add AI-generated suggested replies to the Messages app, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/more-details-about-ios-18s-ai-features-revealed/\"><em>AppleInsider</em></a>. This feature would analyze recent messages in a conversation and provide a few suggested replies that users could tap on to send.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Custom Emoji</h2>\r<br />\nAnother rumored AI-powered feature is the option to send <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">custom emoji that are automatically generated</a> based on the context of recent messages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Message Recaps</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18 is rumored to provide <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">AI-generated recaps of information</a> from several apps, including recent messages received in the Messages app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Tapback Icons</h2>\r<br />\nTapback icons (the heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, \"haha,\" exclamation marks, and question mark that can be added to messages) may be redesigned on iOS 18, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in his latest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/\">Messages</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ios-18-rumored-features-for-messages-app/\">iOS 18 Rumored to Add These 6 New Features to iPhone's Messages App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-add-these-6-new-features-to-iphones-messages-app.2428029/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bdc6e8bb977e3c9f7bf29be4b56313d10b6c40dcd296158aac8070a2cc2dfe43","category":"Apple"}
