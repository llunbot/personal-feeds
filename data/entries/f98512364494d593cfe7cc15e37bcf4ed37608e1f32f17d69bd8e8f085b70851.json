Last month, Holmes' challenged Davila's previous denial of bail, asking the 9th Circuit appeals court to weigh in. The move triggered an automatic delay to the start of her 11-year-and-three-month prison term while the appeals court reviewed her argument. Davila had previously ordered her to report to prison on April 27.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939999#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939999&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f98512364494d593cfe7cc15e37bcf4ed37608e1f32f17d69bd8e8f085b70851","category":"Tech"}
