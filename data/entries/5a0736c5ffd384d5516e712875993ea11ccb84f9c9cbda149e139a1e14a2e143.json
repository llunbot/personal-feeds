The beauty of having such a great selection of different brands and nutrition types is that you can experiment with many different options to work out what does the job best for you, and when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you handle the intensity of energy gels, or does your stomach prefer it when you mix it up with solid energy bars? Are you happiest consuming your carbohydrates in liquid form mixed into your water or do you crave ‘normal’ food rather than energy supplements?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about the different types of energy products for cycling, this guide is for you. After showcasing some of our favourite options on the market, from all-natural gels to bakes, chews and bars, we delve into why you’d want to consider each of these options, and when is optimum to reach into your jersey pocket for one.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

The bulk bottles are currently available in either orange or berry flavour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer the simplicity of ready-portioned energy gels, then it’s good to know that High5 offers a free wrapper recycling service, with a prepaid envelope provided in each order.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Maurten Solid C 160</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Maurten \" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maurten-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£29.95/12 bars |<a href=\"https://www.maurten.com/products/gb/solid-c-160\" target=\"_blank\"> View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>55g oat-based cocoa energy bar</li>\n\n\n\n<li>72.7g carbohydrates per 100g</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A new oat-based energy bar from Swedish-born race nutrition brand Maurten, the Solid C 160 bar adds cocoa while the Solid 160 bar retains its natural flavour.

You’ll need to start consuming your first bar, gel or chew at 45 minutes into your ride, which is when your body’s energy stores of glycogen start to become depleted. These reserves run out completely after 90 minutes, but you’ll want to avoid going there – as anyone who’s ever experienced ‘the bonk’ or ‘hitting the wall’ will know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A general rule of thumb on the bike is to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-much-food-should-i-take-on-a-ride\" target=\"_blank\">eat </a>before you’re hungry, and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-much-fluid-should-you-drink-when-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">drink </a>before you’re thirsty. In fact, learning to eat and drink well on the bike is just as important as training your muscles to gain fitness, and it’s something that often takes riders some time to get used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can start eating at 45 minutes into your ride and keep drip-feeding in the energy until the end of your ride. How many gels, bars and chews you opt for largely depends on how long you’re riding for, your body composition, and exercise intensity, plus the weather conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>When should I use energy gels and why?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy gels are one of the most compact and efficient ways of delivering energy into the body. They’re small in your pocket, pretty easy to consume with no chewing required, and don’t leave your mouth dry like some bars can do. Having said that, it’s still a good idea to wash them down with a swig of water from your bottle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy gels also deliver carbohydrates in a way that they’re most rapidly digested, so you’ll feel that hit faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some riders really like energy gels for their simplicity, though if you’re planning a long ride, fuelling on gels alone may cause gastrointestinal upset. You could consider alternating between gels and solid energy options like bars, bakes or chews, and the variety may also be more palatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite tip for energy gels is to keep one stashed away in a tool roll. You never know when you might need one unexpectedly (ride taking longer than planned, cafe shut, change of conditions etc) but you’ll sure be glad that it’s there when you really need it! </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>When should I use energy bars and why?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy bars and bakes are a solid food alternative to energy gels, usually based on an oat or rice recipe. Some riders prefer to chew their nutrition and find it more satiating, and you can also nibble away at a bar at regular intervals whereas a gel pretty much has to be consumed in one go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a big range of energy bars on the market with many different sizes and flavours on offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What other types of energy products are there?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside energy gels and energy bars, there’s a myriad of other energy products including chews, shots, blocks, and gums. These are often jelly-like carbohydrate sources that require a little chewing and are more solid than gels but not quite the same as bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These chews and blocks tend to be portioned into bite-size chunks so you can pop one out of your pocket and into your mouth at regular intervals, for example every 10-15 minutes, which helps you drip-feed in the energy you need to perform your best. Why not set a regular alert on your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\" target=\"_blank\">cycling computer</a> so you don’t forget to eat?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the benefits of using an energy drink?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll notice that we haven’t mentioned much about energy powders in this buyer’s guide. These are another great way of increasing your carbohydrate intake, usually through a high-carbohydrate powder that’s mixed into your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">water bottles</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using an energy drink can be really handy when you’re struggling to eat (for example during intense racing when unwrapping a bar is impractical), or when you have flavour fatigue from your solid ride foods or gels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opting for an energy drink can also be beneficial as it will allow you to drip feed in carbohydrates throughout each hour, rather than one big hit like a gel or bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How many grams of carbohydrate do I need to consume on my rides?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How many grams of carbohydrate you should aim to consume per hour on your ride will depend on your body size, riding intensity and environmental conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not rocket science that if you’re pushing harder, you’ll need to take on more energy to fuel that, and if it’s blowing a whoolie and tipping it down then extra energy will certainly help you out. Larger riders will also require a greater carbohydrate intake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many nutrition brands offer online advice to help you work out how many grams of carbs you’ll need, such as this one from <a href=\"https://www.precisionhydration.com/performance-advice/nutrition/how-much-carbohydrate-carbs-athletes-per-hour/\" target=\"_blank\">Precision Fuel and Hydration</a>. Generally speaking, around 60g-90g of carbohydrates per hour is a good benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should I opt for products that contain caffeine?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar plus <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/can-caffeine-make-you-ride-your-bike-faster\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine</a>, what’s not to love? You can get that post-coffee boost with a caffeine gel or other energy products that also contain caffeine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that it’ll give you that extra oomph, as caffeine can lower the feeling of perceived exertion, but the bad news is that you can’t rely on these throughout your ride, just like you lose the benefit if you drink coffee all day, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, save your caffeine-enriched options for when you know you’ll need that bit of extra help, for example at the end of a long ride, or before a testing climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don’t be a #gelend</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One last thing on nutrition – always make sure you pocket your wrappers and make sure they’re either disposed of or recycled properly. Nothing spoils a ride or a sublime climb like finding another cyclist’s litter tossed carelessly into the road. You’re not a pro, and you don’t have an entourage to clean up after you. In the words of Trash Free Trails, don’t be a gelend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Keen to check out more on off-the-bike nutrition?
