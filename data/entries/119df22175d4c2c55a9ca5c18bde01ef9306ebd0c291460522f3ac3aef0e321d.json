Others have complained that on-device AI, like math homework, is simply <em>too hard</em>. “Plus, if it’s on the device, how will we scrape all the data?! It’s like you’re not even thinking!” That part’s just a coincidence, of course. It’s really because it’s too hard. Doesn’t work. Not even worth trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple, as Pierce notes, thinks it can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>By taking advantage of the most inexpensive and available storage on your device, they found, the models can run faster and more efficiently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The killer app here, of course, is making Siri better. But beyond just a Siri that’s more responsive and intelligent is the ability to privately synthesize your information for you. Apple greatly improved autocompletion by putting it on the device, so it would try to anticipate the words you might want next, not what some clown in Hoboken wants. (The Macalope’s not trying to deride Hoboken, it’s just that there’s an actual clown who lives there who was greatly skewing the autocompletion data. Thanks, <em>Carl</em>.) Imagine your device knowing you better based on your data… and then not sharing that with advertisers. Seems worth a little wait to the Macalope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is unusual. People said Apple was late to other janky technologies, too, like netPCs, netbooks, and, well, smart speakers. Smart speakers persist, of course, but the market potential <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/&amp;xcust=1-1-2324860-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">wasn’t exactly</a> one Apple needed to rush to get into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It obviously remains to be seen if Apple can make on-device AI work. Maybe it can’t deliver. But it should at least get some credit for trying to implement AI in a way that’s better from the perspectives of privacy, licensing and targeted results.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"119df22175d4c2c55a9ca5c18bde01ef9306ebd0c291460522f3ac3aef0e321d","category":"Apple"}
