That’s right, now you can get the Baby Limus in 38mm in the Challenge HTLR casing. The supersized Baby Limus exceeds the cyclocross category in its voluminous casing, transforming this comfortable and capable cyclocross tread into a fast-rolling gravel race companion. Meet the new Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Do you know the Challenge Baby Limus tire?</em> </strong>If not, let me introduce you to it. The Baby Limus is a modern Grifo tread (save your comments or anger until the end) and a mixed-conditions tire that leans slightly toward the muddier side of life. In Challenge’s words, <em>“It offers something for everyone.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-tire--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-tire--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR full tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-tire--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-tire--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-tire--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-tire--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-tire--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Why is it named Baby Limus? </strong></em>Challenge has a deep mud tread called the Limus (highly recommended). The tread pattern was very successful. The Y side knobs worked their way into a dry/icy conditions tire called the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/challenge-tires-adds-chicane-semi-slick-cyclocross-tires/\">Chicane </a>with the help of former British National Champ <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cxhelen/?hl=en\">Helen Wyman</a>. That tread was also very successful, the template was clear when Challenge looked to create an all-arounder tread. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde.jpg\" alt=\"Challenge Pro-only Team Edition Red limited cyclocross tubulars, Chicane, Dune, Koksijde\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Challenge-Pro-only-Team-Edition-cyclocross-tubulars_fast-file-treads_Chicane-Dune-Koksijde-1536x768.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>The Challenge Chicane, Dune, and Koksijde in Team Edition Tubular Casing (Image: Challenge)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, the team worked backward from the Limus mud tire and turned down the volume on the tread size and thickness. The Baby Limus features the same side Y-shaped knobs as the Limus but replaces the center tread with a lower profile and tightly packed Y pattern. This downsizing shortened the transitional knobs in the process, giving the tire an excellent round profile compared to the flat-top Chicane. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aren’t All Cyclocross Tires 33mm?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, but no… for the riders racing the UCI fields, the tire size is capped at 33mm. This means the rider and team also dabble in the 30-32mm treads, but 33mm is the most common size. Don’t even try to sneak one by the UCI, either. They measure every tire (worldwide) to make sure they are compliant. If only they were this hardline about doping…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR close up tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up-tread--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’re NOT in the UCI fields, you can use a 38mm (and up) for masters and so on. The 38mm sizing is approved for the USA National Championships and offers a nice mix of comfort and speed for most riders. Hence, the explosion of 38mm treads coming into the cyclocross market. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-weight--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Casing: </strong>Challenge Handmade Tubeless Ready Casing (HTLR) Cotton</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>TPI:</strong> 300</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rim Type: </strong>Tubeless and Hookless</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> 38mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Measure size on 25mm rim: </strong>38.20mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>445g</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $86.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1439\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR tight packed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--2048x1151.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tight-packed--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Review: Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge Tubeless Cyclocross Tire Setup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For some, the Challenge cyclocross tires can be <em>challenging</em> to get on the rim (see what I did there?). I was also in this category of installers. That is until I brought it up with the Challenge team, and they explained politely: <em>“You’re doing it wrong.”</em> Now, it’s not that I was putting the tire on wrong. I didn’t use the correct order of operations that Challenge asks you to implement when installing these HTLR tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR mounting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-mounting--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>It’s not a trick; it’s a process.</strong></em> The HRLT tires are flatter and softer than the nylon tires. This cotton casing makes them highly noodley and hard to manage while installing. So, Challenge asks you to start the installation like this: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my fifth time using this method to install new Challenge HTLR tires, and it’s always easier. That said, the initial install is the only time mounting the tire can be tough. After that, they are much easier to mount without using a tire lever. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-bike--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m running the Challenge Baby Limus 38mms on a pair of<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/forge-bond-new-cr-35-45-road-wheels/\"> Forge + Bond 45mm</a> wheels with a 25mm internal width and hookless bead. The tires pumped up to a precise 38.20mm when fully inflated and didn’t require any special tubeless whispering while seating. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR center tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-center-tread--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ride Impressions – Challenge Baby Limus 38mm </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My first rides on the Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR were on the road and on our local cyclocross courses and single track. I’m familiar with the Baby Limus tread, and it’s a favorite of mine for slightly muddy races. The Baby Limus tread excels, whereas a Grifo tread might not have the grip for off-camber features. The Y side knobs allow for more grip and crawling, and digging when compared to the Grifo dotted side knob. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR tread sunlight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-tread-sun-liught--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the road, I was happy with the rolling sensation. I expected them to be more sluggish than the Grifo 38mm I traded them out for. However, they were just as quick and moderately faster. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR bike back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-bike-back--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cyclocross Riding</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m slowly becoming a convert to the 38mm cyclocross race tire. I’ve reviewed (and am currently racing) the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cx-tire-review-challenge-team-edition-red-h-tlr-tires-38mm-grifo-tubular/\">Challenge Grifo 38mm tubular tires </a>and have trained on the Grifo HTLR 38mm tires for some time. The extra bit of comfort and rolling speed is definitely an upside. Those riders that are super adjusted to the 33mm tread could feel a slight lag in cornering response, but the rolling comfort should balance that out. I especially like them for courses that have less than pristine conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-lgog--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re riding a very bumpy course with lumpy grass sections, you’d love the 38mm suspension-like feel. They are slightly heavier than the 33mm version, so they will add some rotational weight to your setup. But all in all, they are a more comfortable tire option with minimal penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR casing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-casing--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>On the Cyclocross Course</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR on the course felt just as fast as the 33mm HTLR version. Where it outshines its 33mm brethren is in bumpy courses and rooty/rocky features. The additional tire volume is such an advantage for smoothing out the course, especially in wooded and single-track trail-style features. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR full side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-full-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for pressure, I went for 18-20psi, depending on the course and demands for the day. For the road and gravel, 20-21psi was a good combo with the F + B wheels. When riding the grass in slightly damp conditions, the 18-19psi range was better. Like any tire or component, it’s up to your riding style and comfort level with the “squish and squirm”  of a cotton tire. You’ll be OK with lower if you’re used to a tubular. If not, aim higher and go down slightly if you’re trying to achieve more grip. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR logos in hte sun\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-logos-in-hte-sun--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Burping Please </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The downfall of tubeless tires (compared to tubular) is burping and the tire ripping off the rim. So far, I’ve not burped one off the rim on any Challenge tubeless tires I’ve reviewed and ridden. I’ve had rims grab some grass off a course but never jump off and lose enough air to cause an issue. So, they passed the “will it stay on the rim?” test for me with flying colors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Are there any drawbacks to 38mm cyclocross tires?</strong> </em>The only ones that I have encountered are narrow rims and frame clearance. The 38mm casing will fold on narrower rims when leaning hard into corners. Upping the pressure can remedy this folding, but you don’t get the performance you want from the tire. So, it’s a trade-off. I would say a great performing tire/rim combo, would be a 21-25mm internal rim width paired with 38mm tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-clearance--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For frame clearance, double-check your maximum tire clearance and account for mud. If you have an older cyclocross frame, the clearance will be tight, so do your research before committing. I have a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spotted-new-cannondale-supersix-evo-cx-bike/\">Cannondale Super Six EVO</a>, and the frame clearance is bonkers high. Most new (2020-current) frames should be able to clear a 38mm tire, OK, but again, check those specs before dropping $170+ on new shoes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR header clear logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-header-clear-logo-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How About Gravel? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I took the Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR on some gravel and was happy with the ride quality. I usually reach for narrow 40mm grave tires for my race bike (course dependent), and the 38mm ride was comparable in quality (it’s only 2mm). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Baby Limus tread is only offered in a 33mm (and now 38mm), so it was never an option for gravel. However, after spending some time on groads (nothing too chunky) with the Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR, it’s a great gravel option. Plus, it would eliminate a redundant 40mm tire from the tire quiver for most riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-close-up--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread is fast rolling and pairs well with most fine to medium-style gravel. It tends to flick and spray some fine gravel to riders on your wheel, but thats their problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How About Puncture Resistance?</em></strong> The Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR is puncture-protective in cyclocross conditions. I haven’t had issues with gravel, but I haven’t put them through the gauntlet of the toughest PA gravel, so I’ll save that ruling for another time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HTLR sun\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Baby-Limus-38mm-HTLR-sun--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Final Thoughts – Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a cyclocross (or lighter gravel) tire that is a true jack of all trades, the Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR is it. The 38mm HTLR casing gives it a nice, supple feel on the cyclocross course and a refined feel on the road. It’s a larger tire, with that said, some frames will limit its use, but it’s a true performer on bumpy, rough courses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, it’s limited to the tan-cotton HTLR casing, and the top tier of Challenge HTLR tires is the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/challange-team-edition-tubeless-tires/\">Red Team Edition casing</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Will we see any 38mm tires in the TE Red casing?</strong></em> Only time will tell. Until then, the Challenge Baby Limus 38mm HLTR is the most well-rounded, voluminous cyclocross tire that I’ve ridden. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.challengetires.com/products?product_model_ids=55122,55051,55029,55036,55148,68414,&amp;preferred_region=233\">ChallengeTires.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Interested in more cyclocross tire talk? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-cyclocross-tires-tubulars-tubeless-clinchers-for-every-condition/\">Best Cyclocross Tire Guide</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-challenge-baby-limus-38mm-hltr-cx-tire/\">Review: Challenge Baby Limus 38mm Tires Aren’t Just Great For Cyclocross </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9655f62dfe2af9235584d8f6b93f1c182b04cd1abf41b5afaf5ac292eef88c55","category":"Cycling"}
