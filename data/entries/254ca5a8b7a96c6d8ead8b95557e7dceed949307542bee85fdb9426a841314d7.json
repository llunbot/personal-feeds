In the post, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/how-to-use-the-new-aws-application-migration-service-for-lift-and-shift-migrations/\">How to Use the New AWS Application Migration Server for Lift-and-Shift Migrations</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/channy-yun/\">Channy</a> introduced us to Application Migration Service and how to get started.</p> \n<p>By using Application Migration Service for migration, you can minimize time-intensive, error-prone manual processes by automating replication and conversion of your source servers from physical, virtual, or cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS. Last year, we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-application-migration-service-major-updates-new-migration-servers-grouping-updated-launch-and-post-launch-template/\">introduced major improvements</a> such as new migration servers grouping, an account-level launch template, and a post-launch actions template.</p> \n<p>Today, I’m pleased to announce three major updates of Application Migration Service. Here’s the quick summary for each feature release:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Import and export</strong> – You can now use Application Migration Service to import your source environment inventory list to the service from a CSV file. You can also export your source server inventory for reporting purposes, offline reviews and updates, integration with other tools and AWS services, and performing bulk configuration changes by reimporting the inventory list.</li> \n <li><strong>Server migration metrics dashboard</strong> – This new dashboard can help simplify migration project management by providing an aggregated view of the migration lifecycle status of your source servers</li> \n <li><strong>Additional post-launch modernization actions</strong> – In this update, Application Migration Service added eight additional predefined post-launch actions. These actions are applied to your migrated applications when you launch them on AWS.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let me share how you can use these features for your migration.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Import and Export</span><br /> </strong>Before we go further into the import and export features, let’s discuss two concepts within Application Migration Service: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/applications.html\">applications</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/waves.html\">waves</a>, which you can define when migrating with Application Migration Service. <em>Applications</em> represent a group of servers. By using applications, you can define groups of servers and identify them as an application. Within your application, you can perform various activities with Application Migration Service, such as monitoring, specifying tags, and performing bulk operations, for example, launching test instances. Additionally, you can group your applications into <em>waves</em>, which represent a group of servers that are migrated together, as part of your migration plan.</p> \n<p>With the import feature, you can now import your inventory list in CSV form into Application Migration Service. This makes it easy for you to manage large scale-migrations, and ingest your inventory of source servers, applications and waves, including their attributes.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-01.png\" alt width=\"299\" height=\"696\" /></p> \n<p>To start using the import feature, I need to identify my servers and application inventory. I can do this manually, or using discovery tools. The next thing I need to do is download the <strong>import template </strong>which I can access from the console.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-02-crop-blur-1024x585.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" /></p> \n<p>After I downloaded the import template, I can start mapping from my inventory list into this template. While mapping my inventory, I can group related servers into applications and waves. I can also perform configurations, such as defining Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) launch template settings, and specifying tags for each wave.</p> \n<p>The following screenshot is an example of the results of my import template:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-03-1024x182.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"182\" /></p> \n<p>The next step is to upload my CSV file to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. Then, I can start the import process from the Application Migration Service console by referencing the CSV file containing my inventory list that I’ve uploaded to the S3 bucket.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-02-crop-box-1024x563.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"563\" /></p> \n<p>When the import process is complete, I can see the details of the import results.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-05-crop-1024x433.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"433\" /></p> \n<p>I can import inventory for servers that don’t have an agent installed, or haven’t yet been discovered by agentless replication. However, to replicate data, I need to use agentless replication, or install the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/What-Agent-Do.html\">AWS Replication Agent</a> on my source servers.</p> \n<p>Now I can view all my inventory inside the <strong>Source servers</strong>, <strong>Applications</strong> and <strong>Waves </strong>pages on the Application Migration Service console. The following is a screenshot for recently imported waves.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-06-crop-1024x266.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"266\" /></p> \n<p>In addition, with the export feature, I can export my source servers, applications, and waves along with all configurations that I’ve defined into a CSV file.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-07-crop-1024x428.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"428\" /></p> \n<p>This is helpful if you want to do reporting or offline reviews, or for bulk editing before reimporting the CSV file into Application Migration Service.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Server Migration Metrics Dashboard<br /> </strong></span>We previously supported a migration metrics dashboard for applications and waves. In this release, we have specifically added a migration metrics dashboard for servers. Now you can view aggregated overviews of your server’s migration process on the Application Migration Service dashboard. Three topics are available in the migration metrics dashboard:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Alerts</strong> – Shows associated alerts for respective servers.</li> \n <li><strong>Data replication status</strong> – Shows the replication data overview status for source servers. Here, you get a quick overview of the lifecycle status of the replication data process.</li> \n <li><strong>Migration lifecycle</strong> – Shows an overview of the migration lifecycle from source servers.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/16/source-server-migration-metrics-1024x370.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"370\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Additional Predefined Post-launch Modernization Actions<br /> </strong></span>Post-launch actions allow you to control and automate actions performed after your servers have been launched in AWS. You can use predefined or use custom post-launch actions.</p> \n<p>Application Migration Service now has eight additional predefined post-launch actions to run in your EC2 instances on top of the existing four predefined post-launch actions. These additional post-launch actions provide you with flexibility to maximize your migration experience.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/21/mgn-04-crop-1024x640.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></p> \n<p>The new additional predefined post-launch actions are as follows:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Convert MS-SQL license</strong> – You can easily convert Windows MS-SQL BYOL to an AWS license using the Windows MS-SQL license conversion action. The launch process includes checking the SQL edition (Enterprise, Standard, or Web) and using the right AMI with the right billing code.</li> \n <li><strong>Create AMI from instance</strong> – You can create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from your Application Migration Service launched instance.</li> \n <li><strong>Upgrade Windows version</strong> – This feature allows you to easily upgrade your migrated server to Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, or 2022. You can see the full list of available OS versions on <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awsec2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeWindows.html\">AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeWindows</a> page.</li> \n <li><strong>Conduct EC2 connectivity checks</strong> – You can conduct network connectivity checks to a predefined list of ports and hosts using the EC2 connectivity check feature.</li> \n <li><strong>Validate volume integrity</strong> – You can use this feature to ensure that Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes on the launched instance are the same size as the source, properly mounted on the EC2 instance, and accessible.</li> \n <li><strong>Verify process status</strong> – You can validate the process status to ensure that processes are in a running state after instance launch. You will need to provide a list of processes that you want to verify and specify how long the service should wait before testing begins. This feature lets you do the needed validations automatically and saves time by not having to do them manually.</li> \n <li><strong>CloudWatch agent installation</strong> – Use the Amazon CloudWatch agent installation feature to install and set up the CloudWatch agent and Application Insights features.</li> \n <li><strong>Join Directory Service domain</strong> – You can simplify the AWS join domain process by using this feature. If you choose to activate this action, your instance will be managed by the AWS Cloud Directory (instead of on premises).</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><span>Things to Know<br /> </span></strong>Keep in mind the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Updated UI/UX</strong> – We have updated the user interface with card layout and table layout view for the action list on the Application Migration Service console. This update helps you to determine which post-launch actions are suitable for your use case . We have also added filter options to make it easy to find relevant actions by operating system, category, and more.</li> \n <li><strong>Support for additional OS versions</strong> – Application Migration Service now supports CentOS 5.5 and later and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.5 and later operating systems.</li> \n <li><strong>Availability</strong> – These features are available now, and you can start using them today in all Regions where Application Migration Service is supported.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><strong>Get Started Today</strong></span></p> \n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/what-is-application-migration-service.html\">Application Migration Service User Guide</a> page to learn more about these features and understand the pricing.
