This year they’ve already raised a whopping $572K as I type this. What a wonderful annual tradition this is. St. Jude is an amazing institution: they both provide world-class treatment for kids with cancer <em>free of charge</em> and perform research to make those treatments better and more effective. Tiltify, the platform they’re using for fundraising, makes it super simple to contribute, including support for Apple Pay.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s push Relay’s campaign way over the top with a push from the DF audience.
