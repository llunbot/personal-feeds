This is, primarily, thanks to the custom 40mm-wide axle. Most track bikes use a conventional 100mm-wide axle, reducing the width of the front end of the bike significantly.</p>\n<p>This necessitates the use of Canyon’s own custom wheels, which have been developed to accompany the bike. A conventional 100mm-wide fork is also available for bunch-racing builds – more on both of these points in a moment.</p>\n<p>Viewed from the front, the fork legs are narrow, slanting inward until they meet the semi-sloping crown. The crown of the fork sits inside a cut-out on the base of the deep head tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – headtube\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – headtube\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The head tube extends backwards.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Moving up, a defined ridge is moulded into the deep head tube, creating a narrow hourglass-like profile.</p>\n<p>The base bar (or stem in the case of bunch-racing builds) also sits inside a matching cut-out on the top of the head tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike’s seatstays join behind the seatpost.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>The horizontal top tube then extends past the aero seatpost to meet the broad, yet narrow, seatstays.</p>\n<p>These sit proud of the rear wheel, though far less so than the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/hope-hb-t/\">Hope HB.T</a>.</p>\n<p>On the Speedmax CFR Track, they are angled inwards from the dropouts, joining either side of the extended top tube. The rear wheel is hugged by a deep cut-out in the seat tube.</p>\n<p>Though it hasn’t provided data comparing the Speedmax CFR Track to competitor bikes, Canyon says it has created “what we believe is the fastest track bike in the world”.</p>\n<h2>Speedmax CFR Track-specific wheels</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon has designed its own wheels to accompany the Speedmax Track CFR.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>The Canyon Speedmax CFR Track is designed around Canyon’s own disc wheelset.</p>\n<p>Unusually, the wheels are optimised around 25mm-wide clincher tyres – 18 to 20mm-wide tubular tyres are still used commonly on the track.</p>\n<p>Canyon says it tested a range of tyres, starting at 19mm and eventually settling on 25mm as the fastest width for track racing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – tyre detail\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – tyre detail\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is designed around 25mm-wide clincher tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Despite the smoothness of a velodrome, Canyon found rolling resistance reduced as it increased tyre size, with no meaningful impact on aerodynamic performance.</p>\n<p>As such, the bike’s wheels are optimised around 25mm tyres, with a 26.5mm external width.</p>\n<p>The wheels are also designed to be used with clincher tyres, which Canyon found to be consistently faster than tubular tyres.</p>\n<p>According to Schuchnigg: “We found a 10-watt saving between the worst clincher vs the fastest tubular.</p>\n<p>“Clincher is the way to go if you’re interested in going fast in the track”.</p>\n<p>Schuchnigg says Canyon also tested the wheel tubeless.</p>\n<p>Although it found a tubeless setup offered a reduction in rolling resistance, the difference was so small that the convenience of a clincher setup outweighs the benefits of tubeless in this case.</p>\n<h2>A widely compatible cockpit</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – cockpit details\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – cockpit details\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon has designed its own cockpit for the Speedmax Track CFR.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-speedmax-track/\">bike teased in October</a> was built using a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/anemoi-aero-extension-system/\">WattShop Anemoi</a> cockpit.</p>\n<p>Schuchnigg said Canyon used these as the starting point for the bike’s design because they were Dygert’s preferred cockpit.</p>\n<p>However, Canyon believed it could offer improvements over the design of the Anemoi, incorporating adjustable finger hooks and broader armrests into the final design of the Speedmax CFR Track.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – cockpit details\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – cockpit details\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is also compatible with third-party cockpits.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Schuchnigg conceded that “on a pursuit bike, it’s about being comfortable – that’s what’s more important”.</p>\n<p>While Canyon believes its extensions offer performance benefits over WattShop’s, it has retained compatibility between both systems.</p>\n<p>The US team will use a mix of the Speedmax CFR Track’s cockpit and WattShop components in Glasgow, but Danish riders are expected to be racing on the stock setup.</p>\n<h2>Who will be riding the Canyon Speedmax CFR Track?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – bunch build\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – bunch build\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is also available in a bunch-racing build.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The project to develop the Speedmax CFR Track began when seven-time world champion and Olympic medalist Dygert signed for Canyon-SRAM in 2021.</p>\n<p>She was closely involved with the design of the bike, with the initial aim of the project focused on producing a bike suitable for Dygert’s speciality in pursuit disciplines.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – Danish team\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – Danish team\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike will be raced by the Danish national team.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>However, Canyon was then approached by the Danish national team, who wanted a bike suitable for bunch racing.</p>\n<p>Despite some initial concerns, internal testing showed the bike could be stiff enough for the rigours of bunch racing, but only when paired with a conventional 100mm-wide fork.</p>\n<p>As such, bunch builds will be offered with the 100mm fork, which also makes the bike compatible with third-party wheels.</p>\n<h2>Canyon’s most expensive bike, but not the most expensive track bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – pack shot\" title=\"Canyon Speedmax Track CFR – pack shot\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Speedmax Track CFR will set you back a cool €20,000.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>The Canyon Speedmax Track CFR is available to purchase by the public for €20,000/£18,999.</p>\n<p>For that, you get a top-spec built that incorporates the best of modern track tech – an SRM power meter, a matching Kappstein 3/32 drivetrain, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/continental-grand-prix-5000-clincher-tyre-review/\">Continental GP5000 tyres</a>, and Canyon’s own cockpit and wheels.</p>\n<p>However, a Canyon spokesperson said the cost (or value, if you prefer) of the bike comes largely from the research and development hours involved in the partnership with Swiss Side, the Danish Cycling Federation and Team USA.</p>\n<p>While €20,000 is a lot of money, the Speedmax CFR Track is by no means the most expensive track bike out there – the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/track-cycling-bikes-explained/\">Worx WX-R Vorteq Track</a>, as raced by the Malaysian sprint squad, costs €28,000 for the frameset.</p>\n<h3>Canyon
