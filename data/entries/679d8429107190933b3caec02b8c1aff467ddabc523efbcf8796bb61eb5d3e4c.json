For instance, <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/americans-no-matter-state-they-live-die-younger-people-many-other-countries\">an analysis from 2022</a> found that the average life expectancy of someone born in Switzerland or Spain in 2019 was 84 years. Meanwhile, the average US life expectancy was 78.8, lower than nearly all other high-income countries, including Canada's, which was 82.3 years. And this was before the pandemic, which <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-life-expectancy-falls-lowest-levels-1996-due/story?id=95649464\">only made things worse</a> for the US.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some Americans may think that this lower overall life-expectancy doesn't really apply to them if they're middle- or upper-class. After all, wealth inequality and health disparities are huge problems in the US. Those with more money simply have better access to health care and better health outcomes.

In fact, the link between wealth and mortality may be stronger in the US than in any other high-income country. But, if you think American wealth will put life expectancy in league with Switzerland, you're dead wrong, according to <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa2408259\">a study in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/wealthy-americans-have-death-rates-on-par-with-poor-europeans/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/wealthy-americans-have-death-rates-on-par-with-poor-europeans/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"679d8429107190933b3caec02b8c1aff467ddabc523efbcf8796bb61eb5d3e4c","category":"Tech"}
