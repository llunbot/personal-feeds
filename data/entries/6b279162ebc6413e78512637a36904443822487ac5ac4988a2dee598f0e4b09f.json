Importantly, the updates apparently make the SL8 faster than Specialized’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-venge-pro-review\" target=\"_blank\">Venge</a> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aero bike</a> ever was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that, the brand claims a notably light 685g frame weight (size 56cm in the lightest paint scheme). It’s over 100g lighter than the SL7 and apparently makes builds achievable that sit on the 6.8kg UCI weight limit including necessary auxiliary components such as pedals, race transponder and number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-frame-stiffness\" target=\"_blank\">Stiffness</a> is claimed to be unaffected, so the bike’s stiffness-to-weight ratio shoots up by 33% and Specialized says that it has even managed a little bump in comfort, suggesting the new bike is 6% smoother than previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More tangibly, while the S-Works models still command five figure price tags, costs have been pegged back across the range, with a given spec generally costing around £1,000 less than its Tarmac SL7 equivalent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices range from £6,000 for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-rival-etap-axs-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Rival AXS</a>-equipped Tarmac SL8 Expert to £12,000 for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Dura-Ace Di2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/exclusive-in-depth-review-sram-red-etap-axs-hydraulic-road-disc\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM RED AXS</a> S-Works builds, and two framesets are available too: the FACT 10R composite blend used on the Pro and Expert bikes (£3,000), and the FACT 12R S-Works composite blend (£4,750).

As such, the new Tarmac now better justifies the ‘One bike to rule them all’ tagline given to the SL7 by the brand’s marketing department, which the SL8 carries through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized says it used its in-house ‘Win Tunnel’ extensively – which it has now had for a decade, and remains the only brand to have its own – in the development of the new Tarmac.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-10.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a truly well-rounded bike, there isn’t the opportunity to extend too far down the path of maximising any one particular attribute, and the above picture nicely illustrates that necessity to compromise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ‘Flow paint’ Specialized has used highlights a lot of the most important areas in aerodynamic terms, so those were the areas that the brand says it worked on optimising for low drag across a range of yaw angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Elsewhere, we didn’t waste time chasing diminishing aero returns,’ says Richard Salaman, Specialized’s UK product manager. ‘In areas that don’t primarily affect aerodynamics, we better tuned them to promote other attributes, such as comfort or structural efficiency.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why the new Tarmac doesn’t have a particularly deep down tube or seat tube. What is does have though is Roval’s Rapide integrated cockpit, released a couple of months ago, that is said to contribute around 4 watts to the bike’s overall 16.6 watt advantage over the SL7.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-11.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It also has an extended head tube,’ says Salaman. ‘We adopted a nose cone because the new UCI rules allowed it. By extending forward of the steerer (as opposed to using that as the leading edge and deepening the head tube behind it), we could actually make the front part of the tube cross section sharper because we weren’t constrained by the conventional 1.125in diameter of the round fork steerer inside. This allows the front of the bike to cut through the air better.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A distinctly narrow seat tube continues this thin theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The new seat tube is thinner than the old bike’s seat post,’ says Salaman. ‘This both makes it faster in the wind and lets it contribute to the SL8’s improved compliance figures.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-5.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the changes made in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale’s latest SuperSix</a>, by necessity the seat post has to be even slimmer than the tube, making it too small to house a Shimano Di2 battery. Where the Supersix uses a sleeve in the down tube to store the battery, in the Tarmac the battery is now slotted into a wedge that sits low in the seat tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aethos-inspired light weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized says that deep aerofoil down tubes and seat tubes look fast, but beyond their leading edge, actually create unfeasibly small aero advantages due to the ‘dirty’ air they sit in, which was been disturbed by the front wheel and rider’s legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a convincing case for the deep tubes evidenced on many of the Tarmac’s competitors can no doubt be made, it is undisputable that aerofoil tube profiles are less structurally efficient in weight and compliance terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a motivating factor in the svelte form of many of the new Tarmac’s tubes: by slimming them down, Specialized says it could make the bike faster in the real world by introducing more flex and making the frame lighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"935\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-13.jpg\" alt=\"Graph showing development of Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-13.jpg 935w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-13-300x209.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-13-768x536.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-13-750x523.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We took the experience we gained from the development of our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-s-works-aethos-review-lightest-ever-disc-brake-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Aethos</a> and applied it to the Tarmac,’ says Salaman. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite literally, in fact. The graph above charts the development of each SL8 attribute through the 54 frameset iterations the new bike went through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The first one is essentially us using the Aethos layup in the Tarmac’s tube profiles. A lot of the Tarmac’s tubes that weren’t directly responsible for aero gains were in themselves inspired by the Aethos,’ says Salaman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, the graph shows how the subsequent reiteration of the composite scheduling moved the Tarmac towards the goals set for it. Notice that the weight target (the Aethos’ 585g frame weight) was never achieved. That is simply because the new Tarmac needs more tube surface area in total to achieve other attributes, such as higher stiffness and better aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized dubbed this process ‘Front-Loading Development’, and according to Salaman it consists of a loop between virtual carbon modelling, finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics. That old trope of new bikes being a little better in every area is down refinements in processes like this. Composite manufacture means the combinations are limitless, and technological developments help make that next step each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fit for everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"man riding Specialized Tarmac SL8 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/specialized_tarmac_SL8_news-6.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the volume Specialized will no doubt sell these bikes in, an important aspect of design is the fit and performance progression across the entire sizing spectrum, rather than just in the middle of the bell curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salaman says Retül, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-guide-to-bike-fitting\" target=\"_blank\">bike fitting</a> business Specialized owns, gives them a huge library of fit data from which to derive bike geometries from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We leverage the data from over 10,000 bike fits in the development of each Tarmac platform. It is so well-refined we haven’t changed the geometry from the SL7. The Tarmac is offered in seven sizes and uses five different fork rakes across those sizes to achieve consistent performance characteristics across the size range,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different fork rakes help the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-bike-geometry-handling\" target=\"_blank\">frame geometry</a> at more extreme sizes from creating fit-related quirks, such as excessive toe overlap in small sizes. However, more forks means making more moulds, increasing costs, so some brands make do with only two or three forks across their size range, meaning bikes of different sizes performance differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Retül also showed us that there can be more differences between two male cyclists than between a male and female. Gender alone doesn’t provide nearly enough data to specialize and that means creating male or female bikes is arbitrary and outdated,’ says Salaman.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/gb/en/shop/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/tarmac/c/tarmac\" target=\"_blank\">specialized.com</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Tarmac SL8 range overview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of launch, the Tarmac SL8 will be offered at fewer price tiers than the SL7, with S-Works, Pro and Expert levels available. SL7 framesets will be released at a later date to cater for the platforms usual Comp and Sport tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the options available right now, buyers get the option of either SRAM or Shimano groupsets within the S-Works and Pro tiers, while the Expert tier uses SRAM’s power-equipped Rival AXS groupset. All tiers are offered in seven sizes: 44, 49, 52, 54, 56, 58, 61cm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At S-Works level, the SRAM RED AXS build includes a Quarq power option and Shimano Dura Ace Di2 builds gets a dual-sided meter from 4iiii. At Pro level, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-force-axs-review\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Force AXS</a> build again includes a Quarq-equipped crankset and the Shimano Ultegra Di2 equivalent comes with a 4iiii single-sided meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>S-Works level bikes get the FACT 12R composite frameset, while the Pro and Expert levels get the FACT 10R layup, which is approximately 100g heavier but otherwise similar in performance terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices are around £1,000 cheaper for the SL8 bikes versus equivalent SL7 bikes. The FACT 12R S-Works frameset is £250 more expensive than its previous equivalent at £4,750, although Specialized now offers second-tier FACT 10R frameset as well, at a cost of £3,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Tarmac SL8 Expert AXS</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"594\"
