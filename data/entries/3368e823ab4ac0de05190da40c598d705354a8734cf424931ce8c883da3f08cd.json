We’re in a profession that doesn’t force\nyou into retirement.</p>\n\n<p>Baron: <em>Well, there’s two sides of that coin, right? There is that\ncliché for actors of: All of a sudden the phone stops ringing.</em></p>\n\n<p>Clooney: Okay, but there’s two ways of doing this, right? The\nphone stops ringing if your decision is that you want to continue\nto be the character that you were when you were 35, and you want a\nsofter lens. But if you’re willing to, say, move down the call\nsheet a little bit and do interesting character work, then you can\nkind of — you have to make peace with the idea that you’re going\nto die! I will walk up to people and they’ll be like, “Oh, you’re\nolder than I thought.” And I’m like, “I’m 63, you dumb shit!” It’s\njust: That’s life. And so as long as you can make peace with the\nidea of change, then it’s okay. The hard part is, and I know a lot\nof actors who do this — and you do too — who <em>don’t</em> let that go\nand try desperately to hold onto it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/02/pitt-clooney-interview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3368e823ab4ac0de05190da40c598d705354a8734cf424931ce8c883da3f08cd","category":"Tech"}
