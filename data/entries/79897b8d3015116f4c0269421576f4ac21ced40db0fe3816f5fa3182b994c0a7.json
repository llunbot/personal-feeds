Liftoff came nearly three years to the date of the launch of the Chandrayaan-2 mission to the Moon. That launch successfully placed a spacecraft into lunar orbit, but a landing attempt was unsuccessful. The Indian space agency, ISRO, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/the-day-has-come-for-india-to-try-for-a-historic-moon-landing/\">lost communication</a> with its Vikram lander at about 2 kilometers above the lunar surface due to a software problem. It subsequently crashed into the Moon.</p>\n<p>So the Indian space agency decided to learn from its mistakes and try again. The Chandrayaan-3 mission has eschewed the lunar orbiter, as the Indian spacecraft remains operational after three years. So this launch consisted of a propulsion module, a new Vikram lander, and a small rover named Pragyan.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953924#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953924&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"79897b8d3015116f4c0269421576f4ac21ced40db0fe3816f5fa3182b994c0a7","category":"Tech"}
