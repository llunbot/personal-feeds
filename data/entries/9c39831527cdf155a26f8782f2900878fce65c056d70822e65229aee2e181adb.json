{"title":"‘Matthew Perry Made It Look Easy’","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-chandler-bing.html","date":1698607046000,"content":"\n<p>Alexis Soloski, writing for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A confession: When I received a news alert that the actor Matthew \nPerry had died, my mind adopted the particular cadence that Perry \nperfected as Chandler Bing, the character he played for 10 seasons \non the NBC sitcom <em>Friends</em>. Here is what I thought, “Could this \n<em>be</em> any sadder?” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-dead.html\">Perry, 54, died</a> nearly a year after the publication of \n<em><a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250866448/friendsloversandthebigterriblething\">Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a></em>, an unusually \ncandid memoir of addiction and recovery. As he detailed in that \nbook, he spent many of the best years of his career oblivious, \navoidant, numb — conditions that don’t typically encourage great \nacting. But he was great. And it had seemed reasonable, if \nrose-colored, to hope that sobriety might make him better, \nreturning him to the nervy, instinctive brilliance of his peak \nyears. That hope is now foreclosed. [...] </p>\n\n<p>To say that he never did anything quite as good as <em>Friends</em>, \nbefore or after, is not to diminish his achievement. Even among \nthe irrepressible talents of his co-stars, Perry stood out, for a \nrubbery, heedless way with physical comedy and a split-second \ntiming that most stopwatches would envy. If you have seen more \nthan a few episodes of the show — and many, many millions have, \nincluding fans born years after its initial airing — you will \nhave absorbed Chandler’s rhythms, his catchphrases, the way \nPerry’s handsome, moony face would stretch like spandex, the \nbetter to sell a reaction. He had both an absolute commitment to \nwhat a line required and a way of gently ironizing that line. His \ncharacter was the butt of jokes. Perry was in on those same jokes. \nThere was a boyishness to him that seemed to excuse his \ncharacters’ worst behavior, on <em>Friends</em> and in subsequent roles. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9c39831527cdf155a26f8782f2900878fce65c056d70822e65229aee2e181adb","category":"Tech"}
