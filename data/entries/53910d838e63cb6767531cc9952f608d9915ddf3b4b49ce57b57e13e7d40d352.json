The new iPad Air, MacBook Air, and entry-level iPad models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/ipad-air-macbook-air-stocks-running-low-apple/\">are \"coming soon,\"</a> according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, but it is unclear exactly when. Gurman said a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/gurman-new-iphone-se-this-week/\">new iPhone SE will be announced this week</a>, and the new Mac and iPad models should follow by March or April at the absolute latest, but perhaps much sooner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a paywalled report today, the Taiwanese supply chain publication vaguely said that the new devices will be \"transitioning to Apple's own chips.\" Given that Macs and iPads already use Apple-designed processors, the report could be referring to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/\">Apple's rumored Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>. However, Gurman previously reported that the chip would come to Macs and iPads \"by 2026,\" so the exact timing of this shift remains to be seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said Apple's planned Wi-Fi chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, but it is unclear if it would have any consumer benefits compared to existing Wi-Fi chips in Apple devices, supplied by Broadcom. One benefit of Apple's chip could be power efficiency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models are expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/m4-macbook-air-chip-identifiers/\">equipped with the M4 chip</a>, while the iPad Air is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/new-ipad-air-models-with-m3-chip-leak/\">rumored to get the M3 chip</a> and the iPad 11 is said to gain <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/ipad-11-with-a16-chip-identifier-leak/\">either the A16 chip or A17 Pro chip</a>. Beyond chips, no major changes are expected.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-suppliers-prepping-for-new-macs-and-ipads/\">Apple Suppliers Preparing for New iPad Air, MacBook Air, and iPad 11</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-suppliers-preparing-for-new-ipad-air-macbook-air-and-ipad-11.2449193/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"53910d838e63cb6767531cc9952f608d9915ddf3b4b49ce57b57e13e7d40d352","category":"Apple"}
