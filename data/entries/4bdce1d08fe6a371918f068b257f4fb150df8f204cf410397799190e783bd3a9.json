And the Carbon crank is no exception. With a 1K outer fabric used for enhanced abrasion resistance. The crank also features replaceable pedal threads, and like the Evo cranks, its axles and chainrings are interchangeable, making it compatible with most drivetrains and frames. Covering you for the future.</p>\n<p>Much like Hope’s HB916, Carbon Bars and Seatpost, the crank was designed, tested and manufactured in our Barnoldswick factory, showcasing the brand’s commitment to maintain the highest standards of Carbon fiber production in the UK.</p>\n<p><b>Crankset Specs:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tuned stiffness characteristics for optimum ride feel</li>\n<li>1K outer fabric has greater abrasion resistance and gives the unique ‘Hope’ carbon aesthetic</li>\n<li>Pedal thread can be replaced if threads become damaged</li>\n<li>Foam core helps to absorb impacts and dampen vibrations</li>\n<li>T700 fibers for optimum strength to weight</li>\n<li>Unique carbon construction method</li>\n<li>Ride feel optimized lay-up and construction</li>\n<li>Proven self-extracting axle/arm interface from our EVO cranks</li>\n<li>155, 165 &amp; 170mm length</li>\n<li>30mm oversize 7075 aluminium alloy axle</li>\n<li>7075 aluminium inserts</li>\n<li>Hardware available in black, blue, red, silver, purple and orange</li>\n<li>Axle lengths to suit 52mm(boost) and 55mm chainlines, interchangeable for different bikes</li>\n<li>Different q-factor and chainline combinations are possible by interchanging axle length and chainring offset to help with frame/drivetrain compatibility</li>\n<li>Weight from: 156mm 422g w/o chainring, 487g with 32t chainring</li>\n<li>Direct mount chainring only, Spiderless Retainer chainrings 28T to 36T</li>\n<li>Q‐Factor 168mm Boost/176mm 55mm</li>\n<li>Designed, tested and manufactured in Barnoldswick, UK</li>\n<li>Recommended use Trail/All mountain</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>RRP</b></p>\n<p>£550.00 / € 690.00/ $695.00<br />\nAvailable at Hope Dealers from April 15th</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"857\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/HopeTechUKBronze.jpg?fit=1200,857&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/HopeTechUKBronze.jpg?w=1500&amp;quality=75 1500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/HopeTechUKBronze.jpg?resize=1200,686&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/HopeTechUKBronze.jpg?resize=768,439&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Bronze is available across the entire Hope lineup from hubs to Tech 4 brakes, pedals, and dropper levers.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hope</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/hope-tech-carbon-cranks-and-bronze-anodizing/\">Hope Tech’s New Carbon Cranks and Bronze Anodizing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"4bdce1d08fe6a371918f068b257f4fb150df8f204cf410397799190e783bd3a9","category":"Cycling"}
