Labs integrates OpenAI's latest o1 \"reasoning\" model, and Vision allows Copilot to see what you're browsing in Edge.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Microsoft says Copilot Labs will serve as a testing ground for Microsoft's latest AI tools before they see wider release. The company describes it as offering \"a glimpse into 'work-in-progress' projects.\" The first feature available in Labs is called \"Think Deeper,\" and it uses step-by-step processing to solve more complex problems than the regular Copilot. Think Deeper is Microsoft's version of OpenAI's new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/\">o1-preview and o1-mini</a> AI models, and it has so far rolled out to some Copilot Pro users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US.</p>\n<p>Copilot Vision is an entirely different beast. The new feature aims to give the AI assistant a visual window into what you're doing within the Microsoft Edge browser. When enabled, Copilot can \"understand the page you're viewing and answer questions about its content,\" according to Microsoft.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Microsoft's Copilot Vision promo video.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The company positions Copilot Vision as a way to provide more natural interactions and task assistance beyond text-based prompts, but it will likely raise privacy concerns. As a result, Microsoft says that Copilot Vision is entirely opt-in and that no audio, images, text, or conversations from Vision will be stored or used for training. The company is also initially limiting Vision's use to a pre-approved list of websites, blocking it on paywalled and sensitive content.</p>\n<p>The rollout of these features appears gradual, with Microsoft noting that it wants to balance \"pioneering features and a deep sense of responsibility.\" The company said it will be \"listening carefully\" to user feedback as it expands access to the new capabilities. Microsoft has not provided a timeline for wider availability of either feature.</p>\n<p>Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-revamps-ai-copilot-with-new-voice-reasoning-capabilities-2024-10-01/\">told Reuters</a> that he sees Copilot as an \"ever-present confidant\" that could potentially learn from users' various Microsoft-connected devices and documents, with permission. He also mentioned that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has shown particular interest in Copilot's potential to read and parse emails.</p>\n<p>But judging by the visceral reaction to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/\">Microsoft's Recall feature</a>, which keeps a record of everything you do on your PC so an AI model can recall it later, privacy-sensitive users may not appreciate having an AI assistant monitor their activities—especially if those features send user data to the cloud for processing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/microsofts-new-copilot-vision-ai-experiment-can-see-what-you-browse/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/microsofts-new-copilot-vision-ai-experiment-can-see-what-you-browse/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3660624ba10eb9ce9182dbbcd9f8ae972bd0e02a52ae5eaaefd0ea513468ea9f","category":"Tech"}
