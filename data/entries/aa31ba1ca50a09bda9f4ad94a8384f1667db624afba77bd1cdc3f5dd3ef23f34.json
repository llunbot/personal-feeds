Netflix <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raises-prices/\">last raised prices</a> at the beginning of 2022, charging $9.99 per month for the Basic plan, $15.49 per month for the Standard plan, and $19.99 per month for the Premium plan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix has since eliminated the Basic plan and added a Standard with ads plan that is priced at $6.99 per month. The company has also ended all multi-household sharing, so Netflix users must reside in the same location to share a Netflix plan, otherwise there is an additional cost for another member slot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMultiple streaming services have been raising their prices this year. Ad-free Disney+ streaming will soon be $13.99 per month, and ad-free Hulu is going to be $17.99 per month following price hikes set to go live this month. There is no specific word yet on when Netflix will raise prices.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/netflix-price-increase/\">Netflix to Raise Ad-Free Subscription Prices Soon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-to-raise-ad-free-subscription-prices-soon.2406185/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa31ba1ca50a09bda9f4ad94a8384f1667db624afba77bd1cdc3f5dd3ef23f34","category":"Apple"}
