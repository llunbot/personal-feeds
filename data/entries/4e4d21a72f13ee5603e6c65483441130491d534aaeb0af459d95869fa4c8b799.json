He said that it could be similar to the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Pro and ‌M2‌ Max MacBook Pro models earlier this year, which were announced via press release and a short video. Gurman claimed that October could see something \"along those lines.\" \"I'm not sure they have enough to drag people down to Cupertino to watch the video like they do for this [<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>] launch,\" he added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYesterday, analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/\">reported</a> that Apple will not launch new MacBook models with M3 chips before the end of this year.
