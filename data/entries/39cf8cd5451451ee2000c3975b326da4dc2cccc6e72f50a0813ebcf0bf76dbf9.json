the rest of their bikes, the new Jaegher Typhoon <a href=\"https://www.jaegher.be/overview-typhoon-fl-xr-allroad\" target=\"_blank\">drop-bar adventure bike</a> is “100% Bespoke”, made-to-order for each cyclist in Belgium. That generally means a ton of options, and premium prices to match. And generally a 2-3 month lead time after your fit is dialed in, whether you order direct from Jaegher or through one of their dealers. Plus, the bikes generally come with simple standard paint jobs, with many color options developed to highlight stainless steel construction. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jaegher-custom-stainless-steel-framebuilder-in-Belgium_custom-paint-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jaegher-custom-stainless-steel-framebuilder-in-Belgium_custom-paint-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Jaegher Typhoon custom steel dropbar off-road adventure bike, custom paint\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jaegher-custom-stainless-steel-framebuilder-in-Belgium_custom-paint-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jaegher-custom-stainless-steel-framebuilder-in-Belgium_custom-paint-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jaegher-custom-stainless-steel-framebuilder-in-Belgium_custom-paint-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jaegher-custom-stainless-steel-framebuilder-in-Belgium_custom-paint-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jaegher-custom-stainless-steel-framebuilder-in-Belgium_custom-paint-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But creative and artistic custom designs are always a popular option – in ceramic or wet paint, for an additional cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard Columbus Spirit triple-butted steel Jaegher FL-S Typhoon frameset starts at 5000€ with custom geometry, that then including a carbon Columbus Futura Adventure fork and standard paint work.
