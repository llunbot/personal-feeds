I learned this lesson again while assembling the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3PqCRW7\" target=\"_blank\">Priority E-Coast</a>, a $1,999 electric beach cruiser from Priority Bicycles. Priority told me right there on the box. \"Warning: Bicycle assembly should be performed or verified by a professional bicycle mechanic.\"\n<p>Once I finished putting the E-Coast together, I was left with a gorgeous e-bike that was enjoyable to ride. But getting there involved more time and swearing than I'm used to. The good news is that Priority apparently heard the curses of its customers, as the part that made assembly miserable has been removed. So you might not need a pro bike tech after all.</p>\n<p>Unlike some e-bike manufacturers, which seem to have popped up out of nowhere in the last couple of years, Priority has been around since 2014, when it launched via Kickstarter. Nine years and two Kickstarters later, it has a robust lineup of motorized and human-powered bicycles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970163#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970163&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8096303e809303758fcaf2be81776d242ecea467db58c0659f0c139b6474ea3d","category":"Tech"}
