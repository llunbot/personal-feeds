We've archived the panel on YouTube; if you want to focus on the discussion about mRNA therapies, you can <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P5yPqdOUHsU?t=6896\">start at the 1-hour, 55-minute mark</a>.</p>\n<div><div></div></div>\n<p>mRNA is a nucleic acid molecule that instructs the cell to make specific proteins. When used as vaccines, the instructions call for a protein produced by a pathogen, such as a virus. \"It helps put up a wanted poster for the immune system,\" was how Nathaniel Wang, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://replicatebioscience.com\">Replicate Bioscience</a> put it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943062#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943062&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"46e1b4309916cfc2a5b6a0dc357035c398d53e80ef659985c4441de4f219f340","category":"Tech"}
