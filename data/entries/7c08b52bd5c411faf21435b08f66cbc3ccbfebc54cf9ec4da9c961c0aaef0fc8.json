For starters, it’s a monthly subscription you have to keep up with. Second, Microsoft just announced a price increase for 365, meaning you’ll pay more every single month just for access to your favorite apps. Why not own Microsoft Office instead?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than pay recurring fees for 365, you only have to pay once for lifetime access to your favorite Office apps on your Mac (or PC). For a limited time, the latest edition, Microsoft 2024 Home &amp; Business, is now available for only $159.97 (reg. $249.99).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Office license might just make you wonder why you opted for 365 for so long, especially since you’re getting the latest editions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Teams, <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc-one-time-purchase?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1579&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc-lifetime-license-25-04-28&amp;utm_term=SALE-327578\" target=\"_blank\">all with AI enhancements and upgraded collaboration tools</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use Word’s new Smart Compose feature to complete sentences or get text suggestions that fit your project. Or, analyze data more efficiently with the help of Excel’s AI. You can also get intelligent suggestions for formatting, design elements, and accessibility improvements in PowerPoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the other improvements you’ll find in the latest version of Microsoft Office:</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://hive.stackcommerce.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-136-1024x1008.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Grab one of these downloads for <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc-one-time-purchase?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1579&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc-lifetime-license-25-04-28&amp;utm_term=SALE-327578\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 2024 for your Mac or PC</a> while it’s available for only $159.97 (reg. $249.99).
