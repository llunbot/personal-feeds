An 8×10″ printed publication consisting of 62 pages/87 photographs made from 35 mm, 6×6 cm, 6×7 cm, and 6×9 cm negatives, from this year’s North American Cycle Courier Championships. It features works from races, events, after-parties, rides, and their surrounding areas in the city. Let’s check it out below!</p>\n<p>Even if you aren’t that into bikes, but just like photography, you’ll appreciate this work. That said, if you love bikes and photography then this should be right up your alley. Chris has lived and made extensive photo work in Chicago, San Francisco, New York, and now San Diego. Transporting his photo studio, so to speak, on what looks like a cross-country ready fully loaded touring bike. He works with cameras of all shapes and sizes, from 35mm rangefinders to 8×10 view cameras, processing and printing everything in his home darkroom. You can find some of his recent work in issues 11-13 of <a href=\"https://callinginsickmag.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Calling in Sick Magazine</a>, an alternative cycling magazine based in San Francisco.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-3-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-3-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-3-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-3-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-7-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-7-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-7-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-7-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-6-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-6-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-6-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/NACCC-San-Diego-2024-Mag-Promo-Photo-6-Chris-Longyne-773504-1148-chrislongyne%40gmail.com_.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>To grab a copy of Chris’ NACCC+ SD 2024 Photo Mag, go to his IG (@chrislongyne) or<a href=\"https://chrislongyne.com/naccc-mag/\" target=\"_blank\"> website</a>.
