{"title":"Ugreen Launches 300W USB-C GaN 5-Port Desktop Charger","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/ugreen-300w-usb-c-gan-5-port-charger/","date":1693926560000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.ugreen.com\">Ugreen</a> today added a new 300W multi-port GaN charger to its growing stock of charging accessories. The $269 brick features four USB-C ports and one USB-A port, and aims to provide enough power for desktop users requiring a single charging solution for multiple devices when away from home.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ugreen-Nexode-300W-2-.jpg\" alt width=\"1680\" height=\"840\" />\r<br />\nInstead of supplying fixed power output to several devices, Ugreen's latest Nexode unit operates using variable power distribution. Its most powerful USB-C port utilizes the Power Delivery 3.1 protocol to offer up to 140W, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes using Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> 3 cable while charging four other devices at the same time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRunning with this configuration as an example, the second, third, and fourth USB-C ports will provide 65W, 45W, and 20W, respectively, leaving 22.5W output from its USB-A port. In other configurations, the second and third USB-C ports are capable of up to 100W, while the fourth can output 45W of maximum power, according to Ugreen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe charger includes a built-in Thermal Guard system that provides intelligent temperature monitoring, taking 6,000 temperature readings a minute in order to keep connected devices protected from overheating, overcharging, and excessive current. The Nexode 300W is also encased in a fire-resistant and flame-retardant PVC shell for added fire protection and drop resistance. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ugreen-nexode-300w.jpg\" alt width=\"750\" height=\"500\" /><div><em>Ugreen chart indicating power distribution wattages</em></div>\r<br />\nThe Ugreen Nexode 300W desktop charger is available to purchase starting today for $269 on <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BZ3FNZ5W\">Amazon</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-300w-desktop-usb-c-gan-charger\">Ugreen website</a>.
