A kilometre ahead is the toll gate that extracts cash from motorists in return for access to the road’s upper reaches (cyclists go free) and which coincides roughly with your emergence above 2,000m. This is the altitude at which things start to get tougher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building tension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a dead end – or <em>sackgasse</em> – means that any race that comes here must commit to a summit finish. Built in 1972, the highest paved road in the Alps tempted the Tour of Germany here in 2005, where the stage was won by America’s Levi Leipheimer. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Notably, Germany’s Jan Ullrich came third that day, although his name now has a line through it on the results board.

Admittedly the climb arrived at the end of a 224km stage with more than 5,000m of climbing, but American Tejay van Garderen took the stage win at what we’d now consider a pretty pedestrian average speed – for pros – of just 34kmh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jan Ullrich, when pressed for his opinion of the Ötztal Glacier Road, condemned the climb as ‘cruelty to animals’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from mild nerves around the ‘<em>Achtung!

The tollbooth thins out whatever traffic there is, and all that is left, other than a smattering of hikers and the tinkling of cow bells, is the gaping expanse of valley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still 800m distant, the Rettenbach Glacier, which is sadly diminished from what it once was, sits loftily, like a rusty star atop a grey-crested Christmas tree. Uncovered by snow, the glacier appears to melt into the scree that surrounds its cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s wise to enjoy these few kilometres along the riverbank because, despite the slope barely dropping below 9%, it’s about to get yet more vicious. A set of four switchbacks rears up above 2,500m, but it’s your lungs rather than your bike computer that will tell you that.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08-776x970.jpg\" alt=\"Ötztal Glacier Road\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The end of the tunnel (and the ride) looks out over the Tiefenbach Glacier – 13.9km done and we’re now at over 2,800m altitude.</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Flanked by an imposing stone wall on the left, the road ahead disappears into thin air, with just a small wooden barrier separating you from the ragged fist of summits to the northeast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vista flicks between the majesty of these pitted peaks and the gritty grandeur of the glacier’s empty ski station.

After 11km, you pass beneath an artful blue arch of sculpted metal that welcomes you to the Rettenbach Glacier ski area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although gradients are levelling out around the low double-digit mark, the altitude is closing in on 3,000m and every kind of rider will be hurting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point you can follow the road round to the right, past the chapel to the car park at the road’s end another kilometre further on, but it would be a crime not to swing left to take in the Tiefenbach Glacier via its imposing tunnel.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-970x693.jpg\" alt=\"Ötztal Glacier Road\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-970x693.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-300x214.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-768x549.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-350x250.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-750x536.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-1140x814.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10-190x136.jpg 190w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/otztal-glacier-road-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The chapel at 11km offers the opportunity for a pitstop, even if it doesn’t sell coffee.</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Gough</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The road descends briefly before slinging into another incline. A chalky lake and a bellowing waterfall flank the right, while to the left are some of the best views of the entire ride looking back over the switchbacks up the weathered slope you’ve just climbed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Named after the late ski racer, the Rosi-Mittermaier Tunnel is said to be the highest road tunnel in the Alps, and shoots arrow straight for 1.7km at a modest 7% towards Tiefenbach. In the tunnel, sweat turns to icy droplets and the finish line becomes a dot of light in the distance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emerging into the brightness, there is now 2,820m of land between you and sea level, and the only way to get any higher is by ski lift. It’s time for this adventure to reach its final action sequence – a 14km high-speed chase all the way back to Sölden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 146 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">lick here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/otztal-glacier-road-cycling\">The Ötztal Glacier Road: The highest paved road in the Alps</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2568477e702305a755169f1124b39e99ea75a0b04c299cf57ee8062d9960f516","category":"Cycling"}
