In his nine months in the Movistar jersey, the Colombian has won a stage and the overall title at the Ruta del Sol, the Mont Ventoux Challenge, and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/high-mountain-victory-for-miguel-angel-lopez-on-stage-18-of-the-vuelta-a-espana/\">stage 18 of the Vuelta a España</a> while sitting third overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all fell apart two days later on stage 20 of the Vuelta – the last day López raced – when <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/after-missing-the-decisive-gc-move-lopez-left-the-vuelta-in-dramatic-fashion/\">he climbed off</a> after getting caught behind a split in the favourites group. The details of the incident took a long time to clear up, and even so, the story <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/lopezs-coach-explains-the-tricky-situation-behind-his-vuelta-withdrawal/\">remains somewhat mirky</a>. What we do know is that neither López <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/movistar-might-terminate-angel-lopezs-contract-after-vuelta-abandon/\">nor the team</a> were happy with the way things played out and rumours that the Colombian might break contract, despite his recent renewal, began to swirl before the sun set on stage 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no news yet where he may ride next year, but his old team Astana is the frontrunner.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/its-official-miguel-angel-lopez-and-movistar-will-separate-as-of-october-1st/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ab7b31491dbecc1c19aa4c89b6a8deb5fc5917c2ba34d468e8da184fbec3046f","category":"Cycling"}
