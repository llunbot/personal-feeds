And most code on most projects is tedious.\nLLMs drastically reduce the number of things you’ll ever need to\nGoogle. They look things up themselves. Most importantly, they\ndon’t get tired; they’re immune to inertia.</p>\n\n<p>Think of anything you wanted to build but didn’t. You tried to\nhome in on some first steps. If you’d been in the limerent\nphase of a new programming language, you’d have started\nwriting. But you weren’t, so you put it off, for a day, a year,\nor your whole career.</p>\n\n<p>I can feel my blood pressure rising thinking of all the\nbookkeeping and Googling and dependency drama of a new project. An\nLLM can be instructed to just figure all that shit out. Often, it\nwill drop you precisely at that golden moment where shit almost\nworks, and development means tweaking code and immediately seeing\nthings work better. That dopamine hit is why I code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ptacek says he mostly writes in Go and Python, and his essay doesn’t even mention Swift. But the whole essay is worth keeping in mind ahead of WWDC. There is no aspect of the AI revolution where Apple, right now today, is further behind than agentic LLM programming.
