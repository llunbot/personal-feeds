Five Ten claims this gives the shoes excellent power transfer and added stability for pedalling hard.</p>\n<p>The sole is made from Five Ten’s famous Stealth rubber. Raised toe and heel pillars provide off-the-bike grip for any hike-a-bike moments you may encounter on the trail.</p>\n<p>In testing, we’ve found this tenaciously grippy rubber to provide excellent grip on and off the bike on Five Ten’s other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-shoes-for-mountain-bikers/\">mountain bike shoes</a>.</p>\n<p>The outsole features a recessed cleat design intended to maximise shoe-to-pedal contact.</p>\n<p>An impact-resistant toe box should protect your precious tootsies from rocks other trail debris.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Kestrel Boa’s sole is made from Stealth rubber and features toe and heel pillars for off-the-bike grip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Five Ten</i></span></div>\n<p>The shoe’s upper is made in part from recycled materials, and Five Ten claims its breathable and abrasion-resistant qualities will keep you comfortable on the trail.</p>\n<p>Boa’s Li2 closure system is used to provide infinite on-the-fly adjustment and a secure fit.</p>\n<p>The shoes look similar to the recently released <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/adidas-the-gravel-shoe-first-look/\">Gravel Shoe</a> from Adidas (Five Ten’s parent company). However, the Adidas sole is less aggressive than that on the Kestrel Boa.</p>\n<p>The Kestrel Boa is available in four colour options. We’re quite fond of the ‘lilac and coral’ version.</p>\n<p>The shoes are priced at £200/$230/€230 and available now from Adidas.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=71026X1519955&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.co.uk%2Ffive-ten-kestrel-boa%2FHQ3549.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Five Ten Kestrel Boa direct from Adidas</a></li>\n</ul>","author":"Finlay Anderson","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ad7772dd1f120d809d4cbe7e10df7184357a47376a39ea08abf16f587da0bda9","category":"Cycling"}
