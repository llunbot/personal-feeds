With ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌, both devices share new features like the A18 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, faster charging, stronger Ceramic Shield front glass, revamped Photographic Styles, the Camera Control, and Wi-Fi 7, but Apple's \"Pro\" and non-Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models are still fairly different devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOur guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two ‌iPhone‌ models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see what additional features and upgrades the ‌iPhone 16

‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ offers a large number of upgrades over the standard ‌iPhone 16‌. With just $200 difference to obtain a display with ProMotion and always-on functionality, a telephoto camera, and longer battery life, many customers will be able to justify getting the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ over the ‌iPhone 16‌. Other differences, such as a titanium frame, slightly larger display sizes, the A18 Pro chip, and a 1TB storage option are notable, but most significant are perhaps the devices' fundamentally different rear camera setups. The ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ unlocks many additional camera features, such as ProRAW and 48-megapixel macro photography, and benefits from an entire additional camera in the form of the 5x telephoto for a additional optical focal length option. Due to the scale and breadth of the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌'s improvements and features, many customers will be happy to opt for the high-end model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard ‌iPhone 16‌ still offers many of the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌'s most compelling capabilities, such as Apple Intelligence support, the Camera Control, USB-C, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, and a 48-megapixel Fusion camera, at a lower price point. With a generous roster of advanced features, most customers will be happy with the ‌iPhone 16‌ or ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, especially those who want a lighter device, do not care for the \"Pro\" rear camera setup or features like ProMotion and the always-on display, or cannot justify the $200 to upgrade to the high-end model. The ‌iPhone 16‌ is a very well designed and balanced device, especially for average customers and those coming from a much older model.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-16-vs-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro Buyer's Guide: All Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-vs-iphone-16-pro-buyers-guide-all-differences-compared.2437805/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5aa4859fa8eeb5740c849f3de766145c8e7470b5086b38b1b43443bfcbb6e053","category":"Apple"}
