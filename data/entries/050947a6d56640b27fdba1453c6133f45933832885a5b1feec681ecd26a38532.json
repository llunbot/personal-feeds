For every major jump—the 12th-generation CPUs, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/intels-alder-lake-big-little-cpu-design-tested-its-a-barn-burner/\">codenamed Alder Lake</a>, come to mind—you usually get several faster but less-than-thrilling iterations.</p>\n\n<p>Intel is officially launching its 14th-generation desktop processors today, and they're firmly in that iterative, non-thrilling group, even compared to last year's 13th-generation chips. The good news for price-conscious PC builders is that they'll continue to work in all current 600- and 700-series motherboards after a BIOS update, and Intel isn't launching a series of new motherboards to accompany them—there aren't many compelling reasons to upgrade from a 12th-gen setup to a 14th-gen one, but it's an available option.</p>\n<p>Even the branding Intel is using here signifies that the processors are a throwback—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/intels-meteor-lake-cpus-bring-a-much-faster-gpu-radically-new-chip-design/\">next-gen Meteor Lake chips</a> for laptops and all of Intel's other chips are losing the generational and i3/i5/i7/i9 branding in favor of \"Core\" and \"Core Ultra.\" By Intel's admission, the last gasp of the 14th-generation branding here is a nod to how similar they are to the 13th-generation chips that preceded them (and, for that matter, the 12th-gen ones before that).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976457#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976457&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"050947a6d56640b27fdba1453c6133f45933832885a5b1feec681ecd26a38532","category":"Tech"}
