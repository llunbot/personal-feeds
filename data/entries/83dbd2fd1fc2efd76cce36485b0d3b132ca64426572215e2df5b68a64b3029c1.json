Even if itâ€™s enabled on the associated iPhone, the Mail app on Apple Watch will download content using your real IP address. Perhaps more worrying, any web content downloaded in a notification preview of the email will do so, too. If youâ€™re using Mail Privacy Protection, you should probably disable notifications from the Mail app on Apple Watch, or at least only enable notifications for trusted senders like your VIP list. You can do this on the Watch app on your iPhone, in the Mail app settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Heads-up: The mail privacy protection introduced in iOS 15 doesn't apply to the Mail app on the Apple Watch. Both the Mail app and the notification preview on the Apple Watch download remote content using your real IP address.<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cybersecurity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-552671-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">#Cybersecurity</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-552671-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">#iOS</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/o0lh9rPQTd&amp;xcust=1-1-552671-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/o0lh9rPQTd</a></p>â€” Mysk ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (@mysk_co) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1460345878946922498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-552671-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><p>Whatâ€™s more, iCloud Private Relay does not work on Apple Watch either, even when enabled on the associated iPhone. This is not typically a problemâ€“people donâ€™t do a lot of web browsing on their Apple watch, which doesnâ€™t even have a Safari app. But it does have a built-in browser to view web links, like those that may be sent to you in Messages, for example. If you open any website, say from a link in Messages, it will load the content from your Apple Watchâ€™s real IP address without using iCloud Private Relay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, thereâ€™s no real workaround for these issues other than to avoid opening links or emails on your Apple Watch and controlling which Mail messages get a full preview notification. You can adjust your preview settings in the Watch app on your iPhone under <em>Mail</em>. Apple is including the App Privacy Report on the Apple Watch as part of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/privacy_management/inspecting_app_activity_data&amp;xcust=1-1-552671-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">watchOS 8.3</a>, so itâ€™s possible that it will change the settings for mail activity and private relay as well.</p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"83dbd2fd1fc2efd76cce36485b0d3b132ca64426572215e2df5b68a64b3029c1","category":"Apple"}
