The first beta was released to developers on Tuesday, September 21. The public release came on Monday, October 25, just over a month later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big addition in iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 is the addition of SharePlay, but there are several other significant enhancements, too. Originally scheduled as part of the iOS 15 launch, SharePlay was pushed back to a later software update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 10/25/21:</strong> Apple has released iOS 15.1. To grab the update, open Settings, tap General, then Software Update.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350966/ios-15-super-guide-features-tips-tricks-updates-safari-facetime-focus-notification-summary.html\">For more tips, guides, and features about iOS 15, check out our iOS 15 Superguide.</a>]</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in iOS 15.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>SharePlay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353492/ios-15-macos-monterey-shareplay-delayed-safari.html\">bumped from the original iOS 15 release</a>, SharePlay is back in iOS 15.1. SharePlay lets users watch videos or listen to music together with others on a FaceTime call, with content in sync.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ProRes support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, you can capture video in the ProRes format in the Camera app. The feature was added in beta 3 of iOS 15.1. To enable ProRes, open <em>Settings</em>, then <em>Camera</em>, and enable ProRes under <em>Formats</em>. ProRes is useful for editing, but it takes a huge amount of storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Auto Macro toggle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now choose whether you want the Camera app to automatically switch to the Ultra Wide format when it gets close to an object. The Ultra Wide camera on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max has a 2cm minimum focus distance and can get much closer to a subject while remaining in focus, but it’s not always the best format for an up-close shot. If this is disabled, you can take macro shots by switching to the .5 view in the Camera app manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>COVID-19 vaccination record in Wallet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With iOS 15.1 you’ll be able to add your vaccination record in the Health app. If your heathcare provider already syncs medical records with your Health app, it could already be there. You’ll then be able to add a verified vaccination record card to the Wallet app, with a QR code that can be scanned by whatever institutions want to verify your vaccination status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the only way to store your vaccination record on your iPhone. We have a feature showing you <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353620/iphone-covid-vaccine-passport-app.html\">how to safely store your COVID vaccination card on your iPhone</a> if you don’t have iOS 15.1 yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unlock with Apple Watch is fixed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Unlock with Apple Watch” feature that lets you unlock your iPhone with your (unlocked) Apple Watch if Face ID fails has been broken for many users on iOS 15. With iOS 15.1, it’s working again, provided you also have the watchOS 8.1. Apple released a small <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/540391/ios-15-0-1-apple-watch-unlock-bug-fix.html\">iOS 15.0.1 update</a> that fixed this issue as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lossless audio for HomePod</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple previously announced that lossless audio support for Apple Music would be coming to HomePod in iOS 15, but after making an appearance weeks ago in the third iOS 15 beta, it disappeared. Now it’s back. The HomePod beta is invitation only, but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/21/homepod-15-1-beta-1-brings-back-lossless-and-dolby-atmos-support/&amp;xcust=1-1-358512-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">9to5Mac</a> has confirmed that in the 15.1 beta you can find the option inside the <em>Home Settings</em> of the Home app, then tapping the <em>Apple Music</em> tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to download iOS 15.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To download iOS 15 on your iPhone or iPadOS 15 on your iPad:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Open <em>Settings</em></li><li>Tap <em>General</em></li><li>Tap <em>Software Update</em></li></ul><p>After quickly checking the servers, the update will display there, with “Download and Install” button. Simply tap that to begin the install process. It will take several minutes to download and prepare the update, and then your iPhone/iPad will restart.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 15.1 release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 15.1 adds SharePlay, an entirely new way to have shared experiences with family and friends in FaceTime.
