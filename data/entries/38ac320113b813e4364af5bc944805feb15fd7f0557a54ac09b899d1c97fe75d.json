According to the report, the major reduction has been driven by extensive use of clean energy, including the integration of recycled materials across Apple's product lines and improvements in energy efficiency throughout its global supply chain. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has fostered significant advances in recycling and material recovery as part of its broader environmental strategy for several years. The company has increased the use of recycled cobalt and lithium in its batteries, with last year's statistics showing that 56% of the cobalt and 24% of the lithium used were sourced from recycled materials. These efforts are part of a larger initiative to transition to 100% recycled and renewable materials across all products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report also highlights achievements in energy efficiency and renewable energy sourcing. Over 16.5 gigawatts of clean energy are now being produced as a result of Apple's Supplier Clean Energy Program, which supports projects around the world. The program has been essential in reducing the carbon footprint Apple and its suppliers, who collectively saved more than two billion kilowatt-hours of electricity last year. The company is also actively removing plastics from its packaging, shifting towards fiber-based alternatives.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also provides financial support to various organizations and programs aimed at improving environmental conditions and promoting sustainability education. In the U.S., for example, Apple supports Justice Outside's Network for Network Leaders program, which focuses on outdoor and environmental education.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSee Apple's full <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/2030/\">2024 Environmental Progress Report</a> for more information.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-environment/\">Apple Environment</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/apple-2024-environmental-progress-report/\">Apple Shares 2024 Environmental Progress Report Ahead of Earth Day</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-2024-environmental-progress-report-ahead-of-earth-day.2424424/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"38ac320113b813e4364af5bc944805feb15fd7f0557a54ac09b899d1c97fe75d","category":"Apple"}
