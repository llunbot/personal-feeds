But if you haven’t you’ll be getting a new version when you do, and it’s not clear why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1772852431463850020?s=61&amp;t=crpSrUjpUdb0p9f2-Ml5ew&amp;xcust=1-1-2281806-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/iswupdates/status/1772938898840142068?s=61&amp;t=crpSrUjpUdb0p9f2-Ml5ew&amp;xcust=1-1-2281806-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">sources</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Apple has pushed out a new 21E237 build of iOS/iPadOS 17.4.1, one number higher than the previous version (21E236). It doesn’t appear to have been delivered over the air, but you can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://ipsw.me/iPhone16,2&amp;xcust=1-1-2281806-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">download the IPSW files</a> on a Mac and install them using the Finder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Apple didn’t deliver it to users means it’s unlikely to have any fixes of note. The original update fixed a bug when scanning QR codes on some iPad models and included security updates for CoreMedia and Web RTC. The new build may include specific updates for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">new iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> that will reportedly arrive in early April, though <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1772859926630559945?s=61&amp;t=NLGXOSTJrinl6InR91MObw&amp;xcust=1-1-2281806-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron on X</a> dug into the code and found no mention of new iPads anywhere in the update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has yet to release the iOS 17.5 beta, which was expected to arrive several weeks ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To install an IPSW file on your iPhone or iPad, connect the device to your Mac using a USB-C cable and select “Trust this Computer” if prompted. Then select your device in the Finder sidebar, hold down the Option key, and click on the <em>Check for Update</em> button. Open the IPSW file on your computer and follow the prompts.</p>\n\niOS, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"05553d604ae3c6e6f7a78df1520481a4153791802b45d840e4ea7a509563277a","category":"Apple"}
