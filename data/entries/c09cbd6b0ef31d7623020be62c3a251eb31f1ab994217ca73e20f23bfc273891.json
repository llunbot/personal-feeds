These updates contain the same security improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are several fixes for kernel vulnerabilities, including one that could allow an app to modify a sensitive kernel state. This is the vulnerability that Apple says may have been actively exploited, but Apple's wording indicates that it only received reports of active exploits against versions of iOS that were released before iOS 15.7.1. It is, however, patched on all platforms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe updates also fix a WebKit vulnerability that Apple says could have been actively exploited, but Apple first addressed this issue with the iOS 16.5.1 (c) and ‌macOS Ventura‌ 13.4.1 (c) Rapid Security Responses, so some ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, and Mac users may have already had protection from this issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause these new software releases include so many security fixes, it is a good idea to install them as soon as possible. A full list of the patches that Apple has implemented can be found on Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\">security support website</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239\">macOS Ventura</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/ios-16-6-actively-exploited-vulnerabilities/\">iOS 16.6, macOS Ventura 13.5, and Other Updates Patch Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-16-6-macos-ventura-13-5-and-other-updates-patch-actively-exploited-vulnerabilities.2396767/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c09cbd6b0ef31d7623020be62c3a251eb31f1ab994217ca73e20f23bfc273891","category":"Apple"}
