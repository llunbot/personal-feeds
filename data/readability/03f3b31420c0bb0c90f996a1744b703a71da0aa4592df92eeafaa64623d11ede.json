To be fair, the Turbos do cross over into the MTB family too, where they end up in the mid pricing level.</p><h3>All-mountain &amp; Trail – Tech details</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133953/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133953/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_side.jpg\" alt=\"Sidi MTB Turbo trail all-mountain bike cycling shoes,&nbsp;side\" width=\"1350\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133953/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_side.jpg 1350w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133953/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_side-297x176.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133953/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_side-800x474.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133953/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_side-120x71.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133953/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_side-768x455.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px\"></a></p><p>That top tier is said to deliver a “high-performance and versatile” pair of mountain bike shoes – balancing all-day pedaling efficiency, comfort &amp; walkability.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133949/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_angled-rear.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133949/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_angled-rear.jpg\" alt=\"Sidi MTB Turbo trail all-mountain bike cycling shoes,&nbsp;angled\" width=\"1100\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133949/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_angled-rear.jpg 1100w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133949/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_angled-rear-297x135.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133949/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_angled-rear-800x364.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133949/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_angled-rear-120x55.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13133949/Sidi-MTB-Turbo-trail-all-mountain-bike-cycling-shoes_angled-rear-768x349.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\"></a></p><p>The MTB Turbo features a suede-like synthetic upper like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-sidi-gravel-shoes-smooth-over-rough-roads-with-synthetic-suede-style/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gravel</a>, now with large mesh panels for better breathability, and the same single Sidi Wire Tecno-3 dial system for fine fit adjustment.
