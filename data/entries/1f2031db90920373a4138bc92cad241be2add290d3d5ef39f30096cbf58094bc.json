We’re now knee-deep in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Tour</a> season and there are plenty of rumours swirling around the peloton surrounding riders’ future moves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is now customary in transfer dynamics, external rider transfers cannot be publicly announced until 1st August, with the exception of neo-pro signings or in-house transfers from development teams. That doesn’t stop the rumour mill though – rumours are spinning long before the watershed opening to the transfer market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the men, the biggest names on the market this year are Julian Alaphilippe, Jai Hindley, Simon Yates and Stefan Küng. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/womens-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">For the women</a>, World Champion Lotte Kopecky has already extended with SD Worx while the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> champion Demi Vollering faces a new round of contract negotiations. Elsewhere, Lizzie Deignan, Juliette Labous and Pauline Ferrand-Prévot are all out of contract.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

leave Jayco AlUla at the end of the season. This will mark the end of a decade-long collaboration between the two that has seen Yates claim a Vuelta a España victory and a Giro d’Italia podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite previous interest from Israel-Premier Tech, Dutch squad <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> currently leads the charge in the hunt for Yates’ signature. The team of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\">Jonas Vingegaard</a> offers a GC powerhouse for Yates. Much like his brother, he will be hoping to star in a confident mountain train set for Tour de France success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps Simon is hoping for similar fortunes as his brother who slipped onto the podium of the 2023 Tour de France in a luxury domestique role. That said, Belgian newspaper <em>Het Laatste Nieuws</em> reported that Yates was interested in a leadership-focussed role at the Dutch team. What this means for the Tour de France next year, we are still to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a quest to strengthen its grip on the Classics, Visma-Lease a Bike is closing in on deals with both Alex Zingle and Victor Campanaerts. The latter made his time-trialling breakthrough with the team over five years ago. A return looks inevitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jayco AlUla looks set to replace Simon Yates with Perth-born Ben O’Connor. High in confidence from a fourth-place finish at the Giro in May, O’Connor will lead Jayco-AlUla’s Tour de France hopes for the seasons to come. The rumour is very strong and considered a ‘done deal’ by some sources. Despite his Australian nationality, O’Connor has never ridden for<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jayco-alula\" target=\"_blank\"> the GreenEdge project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Connor’s exit from the French team comes after a breakthrough Tour from teammate Felix Gall last summer. Furthermore, Gall penned a two-year contract extension earlier this year. O’Connor was offered Giro leadership at Decathlon-AG2R in favour of another Tour de France captaincy during the winter. The recent series of <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/tour-de-france-unchained-netflix-season-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix’s Tour de France: Unchained</a></em> also unearthed some turbulence in the relationship between the Australian and the team’s staff. O’Connor has been contracted to AG2R since the beginning of 2021. During that time, he has claimed a stage win and a top five at the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The many wings of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T160900.566.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>UNIPUBLIC / SPRINT CYCLING AGENCY</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a big rebrand and budget increase ahead of the 2024 Tour de France, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe have been making their big ambitions in the 2025 transfer market known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaden Groves has been a breakout star at Alpecin-Deceuninck. The Australian secured a green jersey and three stage wins at the Vuelta during his time with the Belgian squad. Groves has also proved his worth as a top-tier sprinter within the team’s highly competitive sprinting setup. That said, he is still to feature at the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, Groves is expected to move across to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, joining his compatriot Sam Welsford in the team’s sprinting core. Both riders will look to return <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ralph-denk-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Ralf Denk’s team</a> to its sprinting pedigree of old, repeating the feats of Sam Bennett, Pascal Ackermann and Peter Sagan before them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/file-2024-07-08T162558.591.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With growing GC ambitions, these interests could be hard to balance.

Alexey Lutsenko, the Kazakh leader of Astana, has also been rumoured with a surprise exit to Israel-Premier Tech at the end of the season, which might be a hint that the team’s sponsorship is changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers have extended the contract of Dutch climber Thymen Arensman until 2027 while they are claimed to be eyeing up Bob Jungels from Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe. Ethan Hayter, the newly crowned British champion, could leave Ineos at the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the women, Lotte Kopecky and Lorena Wiebes have penned hefty contract extensions until 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Curious where the money for these big contracts comes from?
