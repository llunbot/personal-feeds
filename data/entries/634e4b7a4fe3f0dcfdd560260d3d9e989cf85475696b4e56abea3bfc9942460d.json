Universities started making their own real-time kernels in the late 1990s. A patch set, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PREEMPT_RT\">PREEMPT_RT</a>, has existed since at least 2005. And some aspects of the real-time work, like <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/timers/no_hz.html\">NO_HZ</a>, were long ago moved into the mainline kernel, enabling its use in data centers, cloud computing, or anything with a lot of CPUs.</p>\n<p>But officialness still matters, and in the 6.12 kernel, PREEMPT_RT will <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-rostedt-0159437a?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABDeZFEBhZrUEECmfcOFAF1snC2lzqCrX_k&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlN9k98ajQf21MqZeP7NF1g%3D%3D\">likely be merged into the mainline</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/\">noted by Steven Vaughan-Nichols at ZDNet</a>, the final sign-off by Linus Torvalds occurred while he was attending Open Source Summit Europe. Torvalds wrote the original code for <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/core-api/printk-basics.html\">printk</a>, a debugging tool that can pinpoint exact moments where a process crashes, but also introduces latency that runs counter to real-time computing. The Phoronix blog has tracked the progress of PREEMPT_RT into the kernel, along with <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-NCON-Consoles-v5\">the printk changes</a> that allowed for threaded/atomic console support crucial to real-time mainlining.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050956#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050956&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"634e4b7a4fe3f0dcfdd560260d3d9e989cf85475696b4e56abea3bfc9942460d","category":"Tech"}
