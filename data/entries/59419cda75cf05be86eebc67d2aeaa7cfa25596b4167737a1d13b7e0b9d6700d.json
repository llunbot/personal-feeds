What are the features you should look for and how should you look after your urban bike helmet?</p>\n<h3>Helmet crash safety features</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> MIPS adds a plastic insert inside the helmet that can slide in a crash and is claimed to help absorb the impact.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>All cycling helmets have to pass a series of safety and impact tests for them to be legally sold in your country. Many will exceed the minimum requirements.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, helmet makers often include additional safety features. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-mips/\">MIPS</a> is the best known. It incorporates a layer between the helmet shell and your head, which will slide inside the shell in case of an accident. This is claimed to reduce the likelihood of concussion in a glancing impact.</p>\n<p>There are other systems besides MIPS that are designed to increase protection, which are used in some urban bike helmets.</p>\n<p>Some of Trek’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/bontrager/\">Bontrager</a>-branded cycling helmets use a material called WaveCel, which is designed to crush in the event of an impact. Koroyd is a similar structure used by some brands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/lazer/\">Lazer</a> uses a technology called <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/lazer-kineticore-helmet-safety-technology/\">KinetiCore</a> that adds crumple zones to some of its urban bike helmets.</p>\n<p>Other helmet makers rely on their testing protocols to prove a helmet will protect you from an oblique impact. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/kask/\">Kask</a> is a prominent proponent of the WG11 test protocol and all its urban helmet designs exceed this standard.</p>\n<h3>Helmet awareness features</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Smith Dispatch helmet comes with a clip-on rear light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / OurMedia</i></span></div>\n<p>In a complex urban transport environment, being seen by other road users is really important for rider safety.</p>\n<p>To that end, many urban bike helmets include in-built lights. Red LED lights at the rear are the most common. They usually have a range of modes, both blinking and constant, and are most commonly powered by a USB-rechargeable battery in the helmet shell, although some use coin cells. Some road helmets enable you to add a small red blinkie to the rear.</p>\n<p>Some commuter bike helmet designs also incorporate white LEDs at the front of the helmet and occasionally you’ll find amber lighting at the sides too.</p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to augment any lighting in your helmet with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">lights on your bike</a>, to increase your road presence, even during the day. At night, it’s mandatory to use lights attached to your bike in most jurisdictions.</p>\n<h3>Will my head feel hot?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Urban helmets are usually more enclosed than other designs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most commuter bike helmets have the “bowling ball” skate-style design, which is fairly enclosed relative to the best road bike helmets and they tend to sit lower at the back of the head. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, depending on how hard you are riding and how far.</p>\n<p>If your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-to-work-guide/\">ride to work</a> is reasonably short, there are plenty of stops and starts and you’re going at a slower pace on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/whats-the-best-bike-for-commuting/\">commuter bike</a>, you may not have time to get hot, particularly if you’re commuting through the winter.</p>\n<p>In wet weather, the extra cover will keep you drier too. Many urban bike helmets will include a peak, which may be removeable, to help keep rain out of your eyes.</p>\n<p>Some cycle helmets are designed specifically to offer protection at the higher speeds that an electric bike can typically achieve.</p>\n<p>Things might get uncomfortable in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-in-hot-weather/\">hot weather</a>, although commuter helmets are designed to channel airflow over the crown of your head to help keep you cooler. In such conditions and for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/5-effective-ride-to-work-workouts/\">training on your commute</a>, a more open road bike helmet or mountain bike helmet will be preferable.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-bike-helmets/\">best budget bike helmets</a> with a more open, vented design are inexpensive and have many of the features of higher priced models, often including MIPS, just with a less complex design. They may weigh a little more too.</p>\n<h3>How do I find the right fit?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A rear dial is the usual method used to adjust a helmet’s fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Adult lids are usually sold in three <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/bike-helmet-sizes/\">helmet sizes</a>, designated small, medium and large, although some commuter bike helmets come in fewer sizes. These sizes cover a range of head sizes that the helmet is designed to fit, which is the head circumference measured horizontally just above the eyebrows.</p>\n<p>The range of head circumferences covered by a helmet size will be shown on the helmet, its packaging and the manufacturer’s website.</p>\n<p>The first step is to measure your head size, if you don’t know it, to determine which size urban helmet you need. Either use a soft tape measure or a length of string.</p>\n<p>It’s well worth trying before you buy, because all helmets are shaped slightly differently, so you may find that one helmet of the correct size fits your head shape better than another. To find the perfect fit, it’s also crucial to know <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/how-to-wear-bike-helmet\">how to wear a bike helmet</a>.</p>\n<p>All cycling helmets have a degree of adjustability. You can usually move the rear cradle up and down, so that it sits comfortably below your occipital bone (the bump at the back of your skull).</p>\n<p>The circumference of the cradle can then be adjusted so that the helmet fits snugly around your head. This is usually by means of a dial adjuster at the rear of the helmet.</p>\n<h3>When do I need to replace my commuter helmet?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Any helmet that may have been damaged in a crash needs to be replaced.</span></figcaption><span> <i>William Murphy</i></span></div>\n<p>Helmets are delicate and any helmet that has been involved in a crash should be replaced. Even if damage appears cosmetic or is not visible, the helmet structure may have been compromised, so it may not protect you in a subsequent accident.</p>\n<p>Many helmet makers will offer you a crash-replacement discount, although this is usually only for a limited period of a few years.</p>\n<p>If your helmet has been dropped or crushed, it may have been damaged, so again it’s sensible to replace it to ensure protection.</p>\n<p>Urban helmets tend to have more durable shells than road bike helmets though. This makes them a little heavier but means they can better at withstanding scuffs.</p>\n<p>Helmets will <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-inspect-and-care-for-your-helmet/\">deteriorate</a> over time as the materials age. This may be accelerated by sunlight, heat and sudden temperature changes, so try to keep your helmet away from windows and don’t leave it in a hot car or other hot place during summer.</p>\n<p>Kask, as one example, recommends replacing your helmet three years after you bought it.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"59419cda75cf05be86eebc67d2aeaa7cfa25596b4167737a1d13b7e0b9d6700d","category":"Cycling"}
