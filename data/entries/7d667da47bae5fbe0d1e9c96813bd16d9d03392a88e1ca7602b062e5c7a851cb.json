Northwave looked to bridge the gap between bulky, flexy winter footwear and high-end race shoes. The result is the Northwave Flagship GTX, a high-end winter shoe with top-tier warmth, full Gore-Tex waterproofing, and a race focused carbon sole. But at nearly $472, does it deliver the goods?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-side--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Northwave Flagship GTX?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Northwave isn’t messing around with the Flagship GTX. This isn’t some clunky winter boot—it’s a full-on performance shoe wrapped in a Gore-Tex shell. They are the most aggressive, performance-driven winter shoes I’ve ever tested. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Here’s what makes it stand out:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gore-Tex Duratherm Kelvin Membrane</strong> – Keeps your feet dry and insulated, even when the roads turn to slush.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Full-Carbon Sole</strong> (Stiffness Index 14 out 15) – It’s race-stiff. Power transfer is top-tier, and no energy is wasted, but it’s winter… so who are you racing? </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>X-Dial SLW3 Closure System</strong> – Micro-adjustable dual dials that let you fine-tune the fit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Neoprene Ankle Collar </strong>is a snug, stretchy piece that disrupts water and cold air.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Aggressive Cold Rating</strong> – Northwave says it’s good down to 5°F (-15°C)… but real-world testing? <em>That’s debatable.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1867\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-297x217.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-1536x1120.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-120x88.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-768x560.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inside-2048x1494.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Warm But Needs Help Under 10°</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Northwave rates these down to 5°F (-15°C), which is ambitious. I tested them at 10° (-12°C) with a mid-weight wool sock, and my toes were starting to tingle. That said, I usually ride with chemical warmers in my shoes under 15°, and that usually sorts it out. The same goes for the Northwave Flagship GTX; with a chemical toe warmer, these shoes can go the distance in the cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1769\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review inner shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--297x205.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--1536x1061.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--768x531.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-inner-shoe--2048x1415.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Were they warmer than standard shoes and overshoes?</em></strong> Absolutely. But, when compared to other winter super-shoes on the market (think the 45 NRTH Wolvhammer), they are not as warm. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review dials\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-dials--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Waterproofing – Almost Bulletproof</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Northwave uses a Gore-Tex Duratherm Kelvin membrane; I can confirm that these shoes are waterproof. I accidentally stepped into an ankle-deep stream crossing while looking for a nature relief shop and came away with dry, warm feet. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review outter cuff\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-outter-cuff-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Northwave Flagship GTX does have an Achilles heel for water ingress; the neoprene collar. On most winter shoes, you’d see a velcro enclosure to protect the ankle and calf from moisture, ease of on/off of the shoe, and, lastly, to keep warmth. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1766\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-297x205.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-1536x1059.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-768x530.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-top-2048x1412.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Northwave Flagship GTX goes with more of an elastic cuff and does a solid job sealing out the elements, and the pull loops make getting them on OK. But I would have rather seen a cuff with a velcro top, like the newest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-mw702-winter-shoes-review-better-fit-better-protection-from-the-elements/\">Shimano winter footwear</a>. This would make the shoes easier to get on with larger socks, and seal out the elements from getting into the shoes from the top. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1683\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-297x195.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-1536x1010.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-768x505.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-sole-2048x1347.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full Carbon Sole</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s where the Flagship GTX stands apart: a full-carbon sole with Northwave’s max XC stiffness rating of 14 out of 15 (15 being reserved for the flagship road shoes). That’s as stiff as their cross-county race shoes, and it feels like it: Hell, it’s the exact same sole as the<a href=\"https://www.northwave.com/en/bike/outlet-bike/outlet-30/extreme-xc#/67-size-47/154-color-black\"> XC Extreme</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1604\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review new:old\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-1536x963.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-768x481.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-newold-2048x1284.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Sprinting? Rock solid. Climbing? No flex.</em></strong> But do you need that level of rigidity for long, steady winter rides? <em>Probably not.</em> And something in my brain keeps telling me that some coldness is seeping in from the carbon to the sole of my foot.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review clear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-297x197.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-1536x1017.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-768x509.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-clear-2048x1356.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most riders tackling cold-weather base miles might prefer a slightly less rigid sole. This would help with walkability in the cafe (jokes). It would could also be easier on the foot, as some riders dislike the rigid feel of a full carbon sole. But, if you’re still throwing down the watts in winter, you’ll love the locked-in feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1778\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review close up inner\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-1536x1067.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-768x534.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-close-up-inner-2048x1423.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleat setup is easy—standard two-bolt MTB compatibility with adjustment markings for precision.

The X-Dial’s release is on the tops of the dials, and for the 1mm release adjustment, you’d have to take your gloves off to really dial in the fit. However, this situation only occurs when wearing thicker winter gloves.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1591\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review flap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--297x185.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--1536x955.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--768x477.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-flap--2048x1273.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fit is on par with other Northwave shoes I’ve tested. On direction from friends who have used these shoes, I sized up to US 10, and I feel happy with this size. They are still narrow (comfortably narrow) but have enough room to accommodate thick winter socks (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-rapha-winter-clothing-wrap-up/\">my go-to is the Rapha Deep Winter socks</a>). If you’re on the bubble of sizing, I suggest going up half a size. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1890\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--297x219.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--1536x1134.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--768x567.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-weight--2048x1512.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Weight – Heavy, but Light for Winter</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At 446g per shoe (size 43), these are way heavier than summer shoes but lighter than most winter boots. For context, the 45NRTH Wolvhammer Boa boots weigh more per shoe than these do as a pair!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Price – Premium Protection at a Cost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At $472, these aren’t just expensive—they’re an investment. There are cheaper winter options that perform well, but if you want race-ready stiffness, splash and waterproofing, and a top-tier fit system, the Flagship GTX checks all the boxes. Plus – I can say with certainty, they will last you for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship GTX Extreme Review header\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Northwave-Flagship-GTX-Extreme-Review-header-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are They Worth It?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the Northwave Flagship GTX delivers exceptional waterproofing, construction, race-level stiffness, and a fantastic fit. But, do they live up to the -15°C (5°F) rating? Not entirely, at least not without toe warmers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a serious performance-oriented winter shoe and are willing to invest, they’ll last you years of cold-weather riding. I highly recommend them if you’re currently wearing Northwave XC footwear and don’t see a change coming anytime soon.  If you need something warm for steady winter base miles, cheaper options could do the job. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.northwave.com/en/bike/shoes/mtb/xc/flagship-gtx\">Northwave.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/northwave-flagship-gtx-winter-cycling-shoe-review/\">Northwave Flagship GTX Review – Winter Footwear with Race Day Features </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7d667da47bae5fbe0d1e9c96813bd16d9d03392a88e1ca7602b062e5c7a851cb","category":"Cycling"}
