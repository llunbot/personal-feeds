At 20W, the PlugBug Slim works with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models and offers fast charging, charges up the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and supports the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTwelve South's PlugBug Slim can be <a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug-slim\">purchased from the Twelve South website</a> for $24.99.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twelve-south/\">Twelve South</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/twelve-south-plugbug-slim/\">Twelve South Launches PlugBug Slim USB-C Charger</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twelve-south-launches-plugbug-slim-usb-c-charger.2307104/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5leQFfOXZAQ:K177HlZhOUI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5leQFfOXZAQ:K177HlZhOUI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5leQFfOXZAQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6766c2d1155003a51ef24589b2451860d573e7d44b4f36121dbbe1d9459baf0b","category":"Apple"}
