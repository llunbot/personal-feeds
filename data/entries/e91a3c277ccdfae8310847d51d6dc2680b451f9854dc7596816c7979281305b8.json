The purpose of these Material Design guidelines was to unify software design as much as possible across desktop, mobile, and the web for a consistent experience.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/featherless/status/1446151509549387781\">Twitter thread</a>, Jeff Verkoeyen explained that going forward, Google will switch to using Apple's UIKit, Apple's framework for building interfaces in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> apps. Verkoeyen said that previously UIKit was not viable due to \"gaps\" in its design language, but a side effect of this was \"drifting further and further from Apple platform fundamentals because those fundaments were also evolving year over year.\" The issue has also been complained about by some users who have felt that using Google's iOS apps offers a jarring and inconsistent experience with the rest of the OS.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith iOS 14 onwards, Google believes that UIKit has sufficiently improved to use it widely in its iOS and iPadOS apps. Since the start of 2021, Google's design team for Apple platforms \"began a deep evaluation of what it means to build a hallmark Google experience on Apple platforms by critically evaluating the space of \"utility\" vs key brand moments, and the components needed to achieve either.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers can expect to see far fewer custom components in Google apps, with elements such as switches, bars, controls, lists, and menus changing to Apple's system designs. The result should be Google iOS and iPadOS apps that look and feel much more native.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere will still be some of \"the highlights of Google's design language,\" but married to \"the best of UIKit.\" The \"new direction\" will \"really make products feel great on Apple platforms,\" Verkoeyen commented.
