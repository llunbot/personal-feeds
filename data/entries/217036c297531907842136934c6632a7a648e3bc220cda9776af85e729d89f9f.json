In both cases, the incident caused a severe impact on the component.</li>\n<li>Like all Bianchi products, Oltre RC handlebars have successfully passed validation test protocols in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4210-5 regulations and are, therefore, safe to use by both our customers and professional athletes equipped with Bianchi.</li>\n<li>The possible breakage of a carbon fiber handlebar is a predictable condition as a consequence of a strong impact generated by uncontrollable dynamics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bianchi holds the safety of its customers and professional athletes in the highest consideration. The company constantly invests in research and development, as well as in laboratory and on-road testing activities to guarantee the safe use of its products.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bianchi_Oltre-RC_action_-2-1340x754.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" /></figure>","author":"Troy Templin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"217036c297531907842136934c6632a7a648e3bc220cda9776af85e729d89f9f","category":"Cycling"}
