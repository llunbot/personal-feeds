In recent years, Agile methodologies have gained widespread adoption as a modern approach to software development, with a focus on flexibility, collaboration, and <em>delivering working software in short increments</em>. This is a key differentiator when it comes to other development workflows.</p>\n<p>One of the key benefits of Agile methodologies is its impact on the quality of the code that ships. Code quality is an essential aspect of software development, as high-quality code is critical to ensure the reliability, maintainability, and scalability of any software, website, or application.</p>\nOverview Of Agile Methodologies\n<p>Agile methodologies are a set of software development approaches that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and delivering working software in short increments. Agile methodologies aim to improve the quality of the software by allowing for frequent feedback, continuous improvement, and adaptation to changing requirements.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Agile Manifesto</a>, created in 2001 by a group of software developers who wanted to find a better way of developing software, outlines the core values and principles of Agile methodologies. These values include prioritizing individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change rather than following a concrete, long-term plan.</p>\n<p>Agile methods break down projects into small and manageable units called <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints\"><strong>sprints</strong></a>. Sprints are completed by cross-functional and self-organizing teams in a short period of time, usually two to four weeks. During each sprint, the team works on a specific set of tasks, and at the end of the sprint, they review their work, evaluate customer satisfaction, and identify areas for improvement. Because each sprint is focused on a specific set of tasks, the team can quickly pivot and adjust their approach if they receive new information or feedback from customers or stakeholders. This results in <strong>faster turnaround times and a more responsive development process</strong> which is essential for creating high-quality software that meets the needs of the end users.</p>\n<p>There are several Agile methodologies that teams can choose from to develop software in a more flexible and iterative way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/impact-agile-methodologies-code-quality/methodologies.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scrum:</strong> This is perhaps the most popular Agile methodology. It involves a small team of developers working together in short sprints to deliver a working product incrementally. Each sprint typically lasts for 2–4 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Kanban:</strong> This methodology focuses on continuous delivery and improving workflow efficiency. Work is broken down into smaller pieces and tracked on a visual board, and team members pull work items as they are ready to work on them. If you’ve used a <a href=\"https://trello.com\">Trello</a> board before, then you know exactly how this works. Other apps, like <a href=\"https://www.notion.so\">Notion</a>, offer similar features.</li>\n<li><strong>Extreme Programming (XP):</strong> XP is a methodology that emphasizes software quality and customer satisfaction. It involves practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration.</li>\n<li><strong>Lean Development:</strong> This methodology aims to reduce waste and increase efficiency in the development process. It involves continuous improvement and a focus on delivering value to the customer.</li>\n<li><strong>Crystal:</strong> This methodology is designed for small teams working on projects with a high degree of uncertainty. It involves frequent communication, regular feedback loops, and an emphasis on collaboration.</li>\n</ul>\nHow Agile Methodologies Can Impact Code Quality\n<p>Code quality is one of the most essential aspects of any development process, as it directly impacts the success of any product. Agile methodologies have been designed to prioritize a customer-centric approach by breaking down features into smaller, manageable pieces of functionality. This allows for more frequent releases of working quality code that can be tested and reviewed to help deliver high-quality software that meets customer needs. Here are some practical ways in which Agile methodologies help promote and impact efficient code quality in development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prioritizing simplicity and efficiency.</strong><br />Agile methodologies prioritize simplicity and efficiency in software development. This means that developers are encouraged to write code that is not only functional but also easy to understand, test, debug, maintain, and modify. The goal is to create a codebase that is clean and simple, which can help reduce the potential for bugs and errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Encouraging modularization.</strong><br />The Agile process promotes the modularization of code. By breaking code down into smaller, modular components, developers can create code that is more flexible and reusable. This can save time and effort in the long run by reducing the need for repetitive or verbose code. Additionally, by optimizing the performance of each component, the developer is able to reduce the overall processing time, resulting in a more efficient codebase, breaking down features into smaller, more manageable pieces — often referred to as <a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-stories/\">user stories</a> or <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20agile%20epic,over%20a%20set%20of%20sprints.\">epics</a>. This approach allows development teams to focus on delivering small, working pieces of functionality that can be tested and validated before being integrated into the larger codebase while also enabling them to respond quickly to changing requirements or feedback. </li>\n<li><strong>Improving readability.</strong><br />It’s important that code is legible and understood across the team, as it affects not only the developer who wrote the code but also other developers who may need to modify or maintain the code in the future. Agile methodologies help developers focus on writing code that is self-documenting and easy to understand by promoting the use of clear and concise coding practices such as self-descriptive naming conventions and avoiding complex code structures.</li>\n<li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD).</strong><br />TDD involves writing tests for the code before writing the code itself, which can help ensure that the code is well-structured and easy to read. This method emphasizes continuous feedback and improvement on the code, as developers are regularly provided with feedback on their work and have opportunities to make improvements as they go. By receiving feedback early on in the development process, developers can address issues and make changes to their code before they become bigger problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous integration.</strong><br />This is a development practice that involves frequently integrating code changes from multiple developers into a single shared codebase. With continuous integration, code is automatically compiled, tested, and validated, which helps to catch issues early on in the development process. This approach ensures that code is always in a releasable state, which ultimately helps to improve code quality and reduce the risk of bugs or errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, Agile methodologies can help developers write better code by <strong>promoting continuous code feedback and improvement while prioritizing simplicity and efficiency</strong>. By following these principles, developers can create code that is more efficient, maintainable, and robust, ultimately resulting in a better end product.</p>\nKey Principles Of Agile Development\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/impact-agile-methodologies-code-quality/agile-principles.png\" /></p>\n<p>At its core,</p>\n<p>Agile methodologies value individuals and their interactions over following strict processes and tools.</p>\n<p>This means that communication and collaboration between team members are prioritized to ensure everyone is working towards the same goals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/impact-agile-methodologies-code-quality/agile-goals.png\" /></p>\n<p>These processes are governed by a set of guiding principles that help the development team to create software that is tailored to the customer’s needs while ensuring high-quality delivery.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer satisfaction is the top priority.</strong><br />The goal of Agile development is to create software that meets the needs of the customer. This means that the customer is involved in every step of the process, from planning to testing.</li>\n<li><strong>Teamwork is essential.</strong><br />Cross-functional teams that work together to complete tasks are a core principle. This means that everyone on the team has a role to play, and everyone works together to achieve the same goal.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility is key.</strong><br />Everything about Agile development is designed to be flexible and adaptable. This means that the team can change course if needed, and the development process can be adjusted based on feedback from the customer.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication is critical.</strong><br />Open and honest communication between team members and the customer is encouraged. Everyone should feel empowered to share their ideas, concerns, and feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Iterative development.</strong><br />Agile development involves breaking the development process down into smaller, more manageable pieces. By working on one sprint at a time, the team can make progress quickly and efficiently.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous improvement.</strong><br />This means that the team is always looking for ways to improve the development process and make it more effective.</li>\n</ul>\nPrioritizing Collaboration And Communication\n<p>Effective collaboration and communication are crucial in any team-oriented project, and Agile methodologies place a particular emphasis on these values.</p>\n<p>Prioritizing collaboration and communication ensures that everyone involved in the project is working towards the same goals and that any issues or concerns can be addressed quickly and effectively.</p>\n<p>When collaboration and communication are prioritized, team members are encouraged to share their expertise and insights, which can lead to more creative and innovative solutions.</p>\n<p>In an Agile environment, team members work closely together, and there is often a high level of interdependence between different areas of the project. If one team member is struggling or working in isolation, it can have a ripple effect on the rest of the team and ultimately impact the success of the project. Collaborating with other developers can help identify issues in the code that may not have been noticed otherwise. For example, another developer may notice a potential security vulnerability or identify a bug the original developer missed. Here are some of the key ways to ensure this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encourage cross-functional teams.</strong><br />Bringing together individuals with different skills and expertise can lead to stronger communication between business owners and the technical team that produces the product. I remember a time when I was working on a project with my team, and we divided the work based on each person’s strengths. This approach allowed everyone to contribute their best work to the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Break down silos.</strong><br />Silos refer to a situation where different teams or departments within an organization work in isolation from each other, without much communication or collaboration. Silos can lead to several negative outcomes, such as a lack of transparency, duplication of effort, and a slower development process. Eliminating barriers between individuals and teams would help foster collaboration by allowing individuals to share their skills and expertise.</li>\n<li><strong>Hold regular check-ins and feedback sessions.</strong><br />Scheduling consistent check-ins and feedback sessions can help ensure everyone is aligned on priorities and goals. I’ve found that this approach helps keep everyone motivated and focused on the end goal.</li>\n<li><strong>Use proper communication channels.</strong><br />Utilizing appropriate communication channels can increase the transparency and visibility of the project. In my experience, using tools like instant messaging (like Slack) and video conferencing (like Zoom) has helped facilitate collaboration and information sharing, particularly in a remote team environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Hold dedicated “Ask Me Anything”(AMA) sessions.</strong><br />AMA sessions can help frontline managers understand the rationale behind the approach and become comfortable with empowering their teams and giving up control. I remember a time when my team participated in one of these sessions, and it helped us better understand the benefits of Agile methodology because it put everyone on the same page and made everyone more confident in the overall direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Failing to prioritize collaboration and communication can have serious consequences for an Agile project. Miscommunications and misunderstandings can lead to delays, missed deadlines, and even project failure. Team members may become demotivated or disengaged if they feel they are working in isolation or not being heard. In the worst-case scenario, the lack of collaboration and communication can lead to a breakdown in the project team, which can be difficult to recover from.</p>\nRefactoring And Code Reviews\n<p>Refactoring refers to the process of improving the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. It is done to enhance code readability, maintainability, and performance. On the other hand, code review is the process of examining code to identify issues or defects that may affect its quality, security, or functionality.</p>\n<h3>Refactoring</h3>\n<p>Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It should be done frequently in Agile projects — often in the middle of a sprint — to keep the codebase clean and avoid <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/defining-and-dealing-with-technical-debt/\">technical debt</a>. Here are some steps on how to carry out refactoring in Agile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the parts of the codebase that need refactoring.</li>\n<li>Discuss with the team why refactoring is necessary and the benefits it can bring.</li>\n<li>Prioritize the refactoring tasks based on their impact on the project.</li>\n<li>Break down the refactoring tasks into small, manageable chunks.</li>\n<li>Refactor the code while ensuring that it still passes all the tests.</li>\n<li>Get feedback from the team and stakeholders on the refactored code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Code Review</h3>\n<p>A code review is a process of systematically reviewing the code written by other team members. It aims to improve the code’s quality, find bugs, and ensure it adheres to coding standards. A code review should be done early and often in Agile projects to ensure that the codebase is always of high quality. Here are some steps on how to carry out a code review in Agile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assign a team member to review the code written by another team member.</li>\n<li>Review the code for readability, maintainability, and adherence to the coding standards.</li>\n<li>Provide feedback on the code and suggest improvements.</li>\n<li>Discuss the feedback with the code author and come up with a plan to address the issues.</li>\n<li>Make sure that the code changes are reviewed again after they are implemented to ensure that they meet the desired quality standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, refactoring and code review are essential practices in Agile methodologies that help ensure the code is of high quality and meets the customer’s needs. By incorporating these practices into the development process, the team can improve collaboration, reduce technical debt, and deliver high-quality software faster.</p>\nAgile Compared To Traditional Workflows\n<p>Traditional workflows refer to development methodologies that follow a <strong>linear, sequential process</strong>, where each phase of development must be completed before moving on to the next phase, with a focus on ensuring that all requirements are clearly defined before development begins. Some examples of traditional workflows include the <a href=\"https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/waterfall\">Waterfall model</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-v-model\">V-model</a>, the <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/risk-driven-development-with-the-spiral-model/\">Spiral model</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_unified_process\">Rational Unified Process</a>. These methodologies are often referred to as “plan-driven” or “heavyweight” methodologies, as they involve extensive planning and documentation upfront, with less flexibility for changes during the development process.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the Waterfall model, for example. This model, also known as the “classic life cycle model,” is based on a series of well-defined phases, with each phase depending on the successful completion of the previous one.</p>\n<p>The phases of the Waterfall model typically include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Once one phase is completed, the next phase begins, and there is no going back to the previous phase. This means that the Waterfall model follows a “top-down” approach, where each phase is dependent on the previous phase’s success. And, true to its name, the process resembles a waterfall.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/impact-agile-methodologies-code-quality/waterfall-model.png\" /></p>\n<p>One of the key characteristics of the Waterfall model is that it is <strong>heavily focused on planning and documentation</strong>. Before the development team begins coding, the project requirements and design specifications must be fully documented. This documentation is then used to guide the entire development process.</p>\n<p>While the Waterfall model has been a popular development process for many years, it has several limitations. For instance, the linear and sequential nature of the model can be inflexible, making it challenging to incorporate changes and feedback throughout the development process. It also puts a lot of emphasis on up-front planning, which can be time-consuming and costly. Plus, we all know that even the best-laid plans don’t always go right.</p>\n<p>As a result, many software development teams have shifted towards using Agile methodologies instead of the Waterfall model. Agile methodologies offer <strong>greater flexibility and collaboration</strong>, enabling teams to adjust their approach as they gather feedback and insights throughout the development process.</p>\n<p>Here are some key differences between Agile methodologies and traditional workflows:</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th></th>\n            <th>Agile</th>\n      <th>Traditional</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n      <td><strong>Flexibility</strong></td>\n            <td>Flexible and adaptable.</td>\n      <td>Rigid and structured.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n      <td><strong>Customer involvement</strong></td>\n            <td>Prioritize customer involvement and feedback throughout the development process.</td>\n      <td>Limited customer involvement, with the customer being presented with the final product at the end of the process.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n      <td><strong>Team structure</strong></td>\n            <td>Cross-functional and collaborative.</td>\n      <td>Specialized and isolated.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Testing</strong></td>\n            <td>Occurs throughout the development process.</td>\n      <td>Occurs the end of the development cycle.</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>While traditional workflows may have some advantages, such as providing a clear roadmap and a structured approach, I believe Agile methodologies are better suited for today’s fast-paced, ever-changing software development landscape. Agile methodologies offer the flexibility and adaptability necessary to meet changing requirements and deliver high-quality software products.</p>\nConclusion\n<p>In conclusion, adopting Agile methodologies can have a significant positive impact on code quality. By prioritizing collaboration and communication, implementing test-driven development, and regularly conducting code reviews and refactoring, development teams can ensure that the code they produce is high-quality, maintainable, and meets the customer’s needs. </p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that Agile methodologies are not without their challenges, such as the potential for scope creep. You can imagine how a flexible process that encourages frequent collaboration and feedback could lead to a project growing more legs than it needs. That said, Organizations that have adopted Agile methodologies <a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/advice/agile-statistics/#:~:text=The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20companies,40%25%20when%20compared%20to%20waterfall\">report higher levels of customer satisfaction, faster time-to-market, and overall improved project success rates</a>. As the industry continues to evolve, it’s likely that we will see more and more organizations embrace Agile methodologies to improve code quality and project outcomes.</p>\n<h3>Further Reading On SmashingMag</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/collaborative-coding-ultimate-career-hack/\">Why Collaborative Coding Is The Ultimate Career Hack</a>”, Bobby Sebolao</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/12/beyond-sprint-alternative-integrating-teams/\">Beyond Sprint 0: An Alternative For Integrating Teams</a>”, Shamsi Brinn</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/adapting-agile-part-time-teams/\">Adapting Agile For Part-Time Teams</a>”, Philip Kiely</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/bringing-healthy-code-review-mindset/\">Bringing A Healthy Code Review Mindset To Your Team</a>”, Sandrina Pereira</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/better-design-process-organization/\">Bringing A Better Design Process To Your Organization</a>”, Eric Olive</li>\n</ul>","author":"","siteTitle":"Articles on Smashing Magazine — For Web Designers And Developers","siteHash":"ab069ca35bf300e9db0da36f49701f66485a5b0d2db0471dfeee07cef6204939","entryHash":"d4e537a7b133db01db9933702df8e63976ce730d23e806793978a750bc7c7bdb","category":"Tech"}
