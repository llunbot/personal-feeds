{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win a 15-Inch MacBook Air From GRID Studio","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/macrumors-giveaway-macbook-air-grid-studio/","date":1688142487000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/\">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 15-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. For those unfamiliar with <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/\">GRID Studio</a>, it is a company that acquires vintage Apple products, disassembles them, and turns them into art for Apple fans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-grid-1.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nEach piece features a deconstructed Apple device with the components artfully displayed behind a glass frame that can be hung on the wall to enhance an office space, living room, or other area. <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/collections/all\">Pricing on GRID artwork</a> starts at around $40, and goes up based on complexity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">GRID 1</a> is one of GRID Studio's most popular offerings because it showcases the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, an important piece of Apple's history. Priced at $400, the GRID 1 features the internal parts of an ‌iPhone‌, with each component separated out and labeled so you can see everything that made the original ‌iPhone‌ special at a glance. The ‌iPhone‌'s shell is displayed next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, circuit board, ear piece, and more. Real batteries are not included because of the hazard of using that component, but stand-ins are available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-grid-1-size.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio doesn't just focus on iPhones, with other devices available as well. If you're an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> fan, a disassembled version of the original ‌iPad‌ is available for $400. Like the ‌iPhone‌ version, the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid-ipad-1st-generation\">GRID iPad</a> features the casing of the first ‌iPad‌ along with an array of the internals, all labeled and aesthetically arranged.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-grid-ipad.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nFans of Apple's chip work can get the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-apple-a-series-mobile-processors\">GRID Apple A Series Mobile Processors set</a>, a $99 piece of art that features actual Apple A-series chips arranged in a timeline so you can see the improvements over the years. The piece includes everything from the 2010 A4 chip to the A14 Bionic released in 2020.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-apple-a-series-processors.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio has started branching out beyond device teardowns and has a <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-apple-badge-collection\">fun Apple badge collection</a> that features a frame filled with pins representing Apple products over the years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe $500 Apple Badge Collection includes 80 badges that start with the 1976 Apple I and run through the 2022 Studio Display. Each pin is highly detailed, and there are also sets that focus just on <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-iphone-x-ipad-badge-collection\">the iPhone and iPad</a> or <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-mac-badge-collection\">the Mac</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-apple-badges.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/collections/all\">also sells</a> deconstructed Android phones, disassembled Nintendo devices, art featuring consoles from Sony and Microsoft, and more. The company is hosting a summer sale right now, with discounted prices on many of its products.
