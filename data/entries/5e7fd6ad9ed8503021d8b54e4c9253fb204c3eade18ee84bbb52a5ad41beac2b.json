On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/\">a court in Delaware voided</a> a massive $55.8 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk. Then, news emerged that Tesla was being sued by 25 different counties in California for years of dumping toxic waste. That was followed by a recall affecting 2.2 million Teslas. Now, Ars has learned that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation is investigating the company after 2,388 complaints of steering failure affecting the model-year 2023 Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.</p>\n<h2>Paint, brake fluid, used batteries, antifreeze, diesel</h2>\n<p>Tesla has repeatedly run afoul of laws designed to protect the environment from industrial waste.
