Other news and rumors this week involved an iOS 17.2.1 bug fix update, rumors about the iPhone 16 and \"Apple Watch X,\" and more, so read on below for all the details! \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Pauses Sales of Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 in U.S. Due to Patent Dispute</h2>\r<br />\nFollowing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-pausing-series-9-ultra-2-sales-in-us/\">announcement earlier this week</a>, Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/\">\"paused\" online sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> in the U.S. due to an ongoing patent dispute with medical tech company Masimo, which has accused Apple of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/09/apple-masimo-apple-watch-lawsuit/\">copying its blood oxygen sensing functionality</a>. Sales in Apple's U.S. retail stores will cease after December 24, and Apple will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-import-ban-repair-issue/\">unable to perform out-of-warranty hardware repairs</a> on many recent Apple Watch models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-watch-sales-banned.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn October, the International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/\">ordered a ban on some Apple Watch imports into the U.S.</a> after finding that Apple violated Masimo's patents related to non-invasive blood oxygen sensing. U.S. President Joe Biden has until December 25 to review the order, but presidential vetoes of ITC import bans have historically been rare.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-watch-import-ban-software-fix/\">working on software changes</a> to address the alleged patent infringement, but Masimo believes that the Apple Watch's hardware design will have to change to become compliant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Releases iOS 17.2.1 Update for iPhone</h2>\r<br />\nApple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/apple-releases-ios-17-2-1/\">released a minor iOS 17.2.1 update for the iPhone</a> with \"important bug fixes.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.2.1-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nUnlike in the U.S., the release notes for iOS 17.2.1 in China and Japan indicate that the update also \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-17-2-1-release-notes-battery-drain-fix/\">addresses an issue that can cause the battery to drain faster</a> under certain conditions.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.3 remains in beta, and has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/ios-17-3-beta-features-so-far/\">two significant new features so far</a>, including Stolen Device Protection and collaborative Apple Music playlists.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>First Vehicles With Next-Generation Apple CarPlay Previewed</h2>\r<br />\nAston Martin and Porsche this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/\">previewed the first vehicle dashboards with support for Apple's next-generation CarPlay experience</a>, which is expected to be available at some point in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Gen-Carplay-Thumb-3.5.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/\">Next-generation CarPlay</a> features integration with the instrument cluster and climate controls, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, a dedicated FM radio app, widgets for apps, and more. The interface can be tailored to each specific vehicle model and automaker's brand identity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Gurman: iPhone 16's Capture Button Will Be for Taking Video</h2>\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman this week confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/\">iPhone 16 models will be equipped with a new dedicated button for recording video</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-Side-New-Action-Button-Emphasis-Bump.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> was first to report that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/\">iPhone 16 models would feature a so-called \"Capture Button,\"</a> which is expected to be positioned below the power button on the right side of the iPhones. This will require the mmWave 5G antenna window to be relocated on U.S. models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Beeper Mini Says Jailbroken iPhone Solution is Final Effort</h2>\r<br />\nBeeper promises that its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/beeper-mini-jailbreak-iphone-last-effort/\">cat-and-mouse game with Apple over iMessage is ending</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Beeper-Mini-Broken-By-Apple-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBeeper announced that its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/beeper-mini-jailbroken-iphones-rescue-imessage/\">plan to let Android users use a jailbroken iPhone</a> to register a phone number with iMessage will be its final attempt at maintaining its Beeper Mini service, which is designed to let Android users use iMessage without using an iPhone as their primary smartphone. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/beeper-mini-continued-outages/\">Apple has made efforts</a> to prevent the service from working.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Your Apple Watch Bands May Not Work With Next Year's Model</h2>\r<br />\nNext-generation Apple Watch models will feature a completely redesigned band connector, rendering them <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/your-apple-watch-bands-may-not-work-with-new-model/\">incompatible with all current bands</a>, according to an Apple leaker known as \"Kosutami.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/apple-watch-series-8-digital-crown.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"957\" />\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has previously reported that the upcoming \"Apple Watch X\" could feature a different way to attach bands to the device.
