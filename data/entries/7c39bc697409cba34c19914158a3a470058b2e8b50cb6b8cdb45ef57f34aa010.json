Hinault is the most recent French winner of the Tour de France, and he won his fifth yellow jersey in 1985. France won nine of the eleven editions of the Tour de France between 1975 and 1985, but have since gone over 35 years without seeing a yellow jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span>Miguel Indurain is the only rider to have won the Tour de France for five consecutive seasons, a feat he achieved between 1991 and 1995. </span>Chris Froome is the only active rider who could challenge for five titles as he currently have four Tour titles to his name. However, he isn't in this year's edition. </p>\n<p><span>Lance Armstrong had held the record with seven Tour de France titles between 1999 and 2005, but he was stripped of all accolades over this period after he was found guilty of doping in 2012.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>5 wins - Jacques Anquetil (1957 - 1964), Eddy Merckx (1969 - 1974), Bernard Hinault (1978 - 1985) and Miguel Indurain (1991 - 1995)</span></li>\n<li><span>4 wins - Chris Froome (2013 - 2017)</span></li>\n<li><span>3 wins - Philippe Thys (1913 - 1920), Louison Bobet (1953 - 55), Greg LeMond (1986 - 1990)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Youngest Tour de France winners</strong></h2>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-55749636_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624032595\" /></span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>Henri Cornet, the youngest winner of the Tour de France (Image credit: Branger/Roger Viollet via Getty Images)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>One of the recent trends that can be observed in professional cycling is the increased level of opportunity and confidence given to young riders. This means that some of the youngest Tour de France champions in history have won the race in the previous couple of years.

He won the yellow jersey in 1904 by a margin of more than two hours, which was just the second edition of the race. Originally, Cornet was fifth to finish, but the race was riddled with various scandals. After numerous disqualifications, Cornet was handed victory.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>1904 - Henri Cornet, 19 years and 352 days</span></li>\n<li><span>2020 - Tadej Pogačar, 21 years and 365 days</span></li>\n<li><span>1909 - François Faber, 22 years and 187 days</span></li>\n<li><span>2019 - Egan Bernal, 22 years and 196 days</span></li>\n<li><span>1910 - Octave Lapize, 22 years and 280 days</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Oldest Tour de France winners</strong></h2>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-162199728_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624032735\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Cadel Evans on the way to winning the 2011 Tour de France (Image credit: Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p>Some of the oldest Tour de France victors came in the race's early years too.
