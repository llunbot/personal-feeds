{"title":"Gurman on New iPhone Camera Features: Portrait Mode for Video, Machine-Learning-Based Filters","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/apple-readies-new-iphones-with-pro-focused-camera-video-updates","date":1628612727000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman, with a few scoops on the upcoming new iPhones:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple first added Portrait mode to the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016, and it quickly become a fan favorite. The feature can put a person in sharp focus while blurring the background in what is known as a bokeh effect. For the new iPhones, Apple plans to add this same technique to video with a feature internally dubbed Cinematic Video. Like with still photos, the iPhone’s depth sensor will create the effect and allow users to change the amount of blur after recording. […]</p>\n\n<p>Another feature will let users better control the look of colors and highlights in their pictures. Users will be able to choose from several styles to apply to their photos, including one for showing colors at either a warmer or cooler temperature while keeping whites neutral. Another option will add a more dramatic look with deeper shadows and more contrast, and the company is planning a more balanced style for showing shadows and true-to-life colors with a brighter appearance. The feature will differ from standard filters, available in the iPhone’s Camera app since 2013, by precisely applying changes to objects and people across the photos using artificial intelligence, rather than applying a single filter across the entire picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Computational photography is easily one of the most exciting, fast-moving areas in computing today. You can literally see it getting better year-over-year. I’ve noticed in recent weeks that Portrait Mode on the iPhone 12 has gotten better than ever at separating subjects from the background.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/10/gurman-iphone-camera-features\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"13d458bf6704aac11f72d502df053c9ace7d095f4e80e6903cc3aaf1f7800586","category":"Tech"}
