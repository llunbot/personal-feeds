And it helps if you can get it for a great price—today Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q61T39G\" target=\"_blank\">Anker 736 USB that’s available for $40 ($15 off)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NP6NG/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s MagSafe Charger for $29 ($10 off)</a>, a perfect charging pair for your iPhones and other Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple MagSafe Charger is perfect for quickly fast-charging your iPhone 12 and later. It perfectly aligns with your iPhone’s magnets and charges them up to 15W (12W with the iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 12 mini). However, it doesn’t come without a power adapter, which is where the Anker 736 comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anker’s 736 Nano II 100W USB-C charger is a great way to not only your iPhone but also your other gadgets since there are three ports in total. This one features one USB-A port and two USB-C, meaning you can power up your MacBook and charge your iPhone and AirPods at the same time. If you want a max 100W charge, you’ll need to pick one of the two USB-C ports, and the power will obviously drop if you use multiple ports at the same time, but it’s still better than using most regular wall bricks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and add the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q61T39G\" target=\"_blank\">Anker 736 to your cart for $40 at Amazon</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NP6NG/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple MagSafe Charger for $29</a> and cover all your iPhone charging needs. Just note, the Anker deal is for Prime members only, so if you’re not a member yet, you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">start a 30-day free trial</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Charging your phone has never been easier or more efficient</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q61T39G\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"efbcf6a96874c13362d9f75c921a37a04e3b602885c8473f1ea6591d55f21060","category":"Apple"}
