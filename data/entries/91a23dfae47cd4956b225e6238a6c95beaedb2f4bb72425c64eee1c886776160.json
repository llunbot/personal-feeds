Not only did the hood shapes improve like its siblings, but the brake levers and function themselves took a massive leap forward in power and ergonomics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its ability to pair and set up improved, too. And like a good older brother, it helps ensure everyone gets along, offering backward compatibility with all 12-speed AXS components.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-3.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1133\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-3.webp\" alt=\"road cyclist on new sram red axs in japan\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-3.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-3-297x168.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-3-1536x870.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-3-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-3-768x435.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After about eight months of riding the SRAM RED AXS E1 group, I’m still stoked on it. The performance is as good as you’d expect from a top-level group with a history of excellent performance, but the brakes push it over the top for me, making it a group that’s simply a joy to use. Side note: If you prefer gravel, there’s also a new dedicated <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-red-xplr-13-speed-groupset/\">RED AXS 1×13 gravel group</a> just for you, but much of this will apply, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The brakes justify the upgrade</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-3.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-3.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new sram red axs E1 components.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-3.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-3-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-3-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-3-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-3-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The nice thing about backward compatibility is that you can upgrade just the brakes for now, gaining dramatically more power and modulation, more comfortable hoods, and dropping about 83 grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-2.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-2.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new sram red axs E1 components.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8.webp\"><img width=\"2091\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new sram red axs E1 components.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8.webp 2091w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8-297x128.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8-1536x661.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8-768x331.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-8-2048x881.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shape of the levers makes it easy to hook a finger around them, but the biggest improvement is the lever’s revised pivot location. It’s a lot higher, giving you more leverage for a much lighter feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM claims an 80% reduction in braking effort from the hoods, and I’ll confirm that. Full braking power from the very top of the lever. It’s incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-11.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-11.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new sram red axs E1 brake lever.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-11.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-11-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-11-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-11-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-11-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also like that there’s a hint of outward flare, which lines up nicely with modern handlebars. That, plus a more pronounced lip at the bottom of the brake lever makes braking from the drops easier and more confident, too. That extra bit of hook provides more security under the finger when ripping down descents, and the overall shape lends more confidence, even when it’s raining and the carbon blade is wet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also easier than ever to adjust lever reach thanks to a front-facing adjustment bolt rather than the hard-to-find bolt underneath prior model’s levers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-4.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-4.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new sram red axs E1 components.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-4.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-4-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-4-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-4-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-4-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As an avowed weight weenie, I’m also stoked that they’re lighter, which partly comes from the calipers, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as an early adopter of drop bar disc brakes <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/road-bike-disc-brakes-are-coming-but-will-they-work/\">who paid the price</a>, I have begrudgingly accepted having more mass where it matters. Larger rotors and stout calipers are a tradeoff I’m willing to make, especially since I’m a larger rider (6’2″, 190lbs nekkid).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I was a little concerned about the skeletal new caliper design, particularly as I built up my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-lauf-uthald-road-bike-brings-real-world-speed/\">Lauf Úthald</a> for a mountainous bikepacking trip in Japan. Me plus a fully loaded bike plus 160mm rotors with brakes designed for road racing had me considering larger rotors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-7.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-7.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new sram red axs E1 brake caliper.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-7.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-7-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-7-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-7-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-7-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Even after some very rainy days and descents, with a fully loaded bike, I’m stoked on these brakes.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But after a few conversations and early test rides, I stuck with 160s and headed to the Land of the Rising Sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-4.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-4.webp\" alt=\"lauf uthald road bike loaded with bikepacking bags from north st.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-4.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-4-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-4-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-4-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-4-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After 8 days of loaded touring and exploring with scarily steep, unkempt village roads and screaming fast, perfectly paved mountain descents (and everything in between), I have no concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously, if you are looking for a reason to upgrade (or just spend money), the brakes alone are worth the price of admission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oh, and those Bonus Buttons…</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6.webp\"><img width=\"2396\" height=\"1038\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new sram red axs E1 components.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6.webp 2396w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6-1536x665.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6-768x333.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-details-6-2048x887.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other killer new feature are the bonus buttons. Sure, you can program them to do things on a Karoo cycling computer and more, but the best setup for me was having the left button perform an upshift (harder) while the left paddle downshifted (easier). And vice versa on the right side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By reversing what the standard shift paddle does, I’m able to shift both directions one-handed. It’s glorious, especially when riding undulating terrain while also trying to eat a snack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try it, it’ll change your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Everything else is great, too.</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8.webp\" alt=\"road cyclist on new sram red axs in japan\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-8-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the trip and back home after, the group performed flawlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifting is smooth and quiet.

Plus, it shows battery levels for all connected components, also very helpful when you’re deciding what to charge from a power bank you’ll need for a few days of off-grid riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Actual Weights &amp; Installation Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-4.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"889\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-4.webp\" alt=\"actual weights on scale for new sram red axs e1 components.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-4.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-4-297x132.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-4-1536x683.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-4-120x53.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-4-768x341.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10.webp\"><img width=\"2300\" height=\"1534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10.webp\" alt=\"actual weights on scale for new sram red axs e1 components.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10.webp 2300w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-actual-weights-10-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actual weights for the new SRAM RED AXS E1 components are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crankset: 468g (172.5mm arms, 46/33 chainrings w/ Quarq powermeter)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brake levers: 202g each, 404g set*</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brake calipers: 151g front, 164g rear*</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Front derailleur: 144g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear derailleur: 260g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brake rotors: 131g each, 262g set (160mm, Center Lock)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cassette: 232g (10-36)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TOTAL: 2,085g**</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>*Brake calipers had the spacers in them during weigh-in because it’s clamped in there and can’t be removed until the hose is opened for installation.

Force and Ultegra, Rival and 105. They leave little to be desired, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where SRAM justifies the expense to go up a level is with ease of ownership and incredibly light weight, plus a focus on the braking performance and ergonomics. For me, this is what sets the group apart and makes every ride on it a joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-5.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-5.webp\" alt=\"action cycling shot with new sram red axs e1 components installed.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-5.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-5-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-5-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-5-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sram-red-axs-e1-review-riding-japan-5-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Japan, seriously. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-ride-and-seek-samurai-cycling-tour-japan/\">Just do it</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sram.com\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-red-axs-e1-review-actual-weights/\">Review: SRAM RED AXS E1, with Actual Weights</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"91a23dfae47cd4956b225e6238a6c95beaedb2f4bb72425c64eee1c886776160","category":"Cycling"}
