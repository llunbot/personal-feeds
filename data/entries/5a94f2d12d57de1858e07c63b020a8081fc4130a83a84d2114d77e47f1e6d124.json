The company has pulled back the firmware and issued a fixed version, but the company's response has left some users feeling less confident in the boxes into which they put all their digital stuff.</p>\n<p>As seen on <a href=\"https://community.qnap.com/t/firmware-qts-5-2-2-2950-build-20241114-released/254\">a QNAP community thread</a>, and as <a href=\"https://www.qnap.com/en-us/news/2024/qnap-addresses-recent-qts-5-2-2-operating-system-update-issues\">announced by QNAP itself</a>, the QNAP operating system, QTS, received update 5.2.2.2950, build 20241114, at some point around November 19. After QNAP \"received feedbacks from some users reporting issues with device functionality after installation,\" the firm says it withdrew it, \"conducted a comprehensive investigation,\" and re-released a fixed version \"within 24 hours.\"</p>\n<p>The community thread sees many more users of different systems having problems than the shortlist (\"limited models of TS-x53D series and TS-x51 series\") released by QNAP. Issues reported included owners being rejected as an authorized user, devices reporting issues with booting, and claims of Python not being installed to run some apps and services.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/qnap-firmware-update-leaves-nas-owners-locked-out-of-their-boxes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/qnap-firmware-update-leaves-nas-owners-locked-out-of-their-boxes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a94f2d12d57de1858e07c63b020a8081fc4130a83a84d2114d77e47f1e6d124","category":"Tech"}
