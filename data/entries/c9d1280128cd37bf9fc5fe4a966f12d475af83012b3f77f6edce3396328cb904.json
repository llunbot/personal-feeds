After all, who really wants to spend more time in front of their screen? That’s exactly why we’ve <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/\">designed the online workshop experience from scratch</a>, accounting for the time needed to take in all the content, understand it and have enough time to ask <em>just</em> the right questions.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/394a4d0e-4c57-4d55-a72a-87f244ab1320/kececypa-1.png\" /></a>\nIn <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">our workshops</a>, everybody is just a slightly blurry rectangle on the screen; everybody is equal, and invited to participate.\n\n\n<p>Our online workshops take place <strong>live</strong> and span <strong>multiple days across weeks.</strong> They are split into 2.5h-sessions, and in every session there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We don’t rush through the content, but instead try to create a welcoming, friendly and inclusive environment for everyone to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/\">things to expect from a Smashing workshop</a>, but the most important one is focus on <strong>practical examples</strong> and techniques. The workshops aren’t talks; they are <strong>interactive</strong>, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work.</p>\n<p>Of course, you get all workshop materials and <strong>video recordings</strong> as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/066c7368-ae9e-493a-b2f1-8f8ed15de12a/friendly-attendee.svg\" /></a>\nMeet our <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">friendly frontend &amp; UX workshops</a>.
