The engineer would be tasked with leading the development of \"an application used by millions to watch and discover tv and sports,\" which heavily suggests that Apple plans to make its TV app available on Android smartphones and tablets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the Apple TV app, Android smartphone and tablet users would have a more convenient way to access the Apple TV+ streaming service, instead of having to rely on tv.apple.com on the web. The app also provides access to MLS Season Pass, includes a storefront for purchasing or renting movies and TV shows, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already offers the TV app on Android TV devices, including the Chromecast with Google TV, but not on the main Android platform. Apple only offers a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Apple&amp;hl=en_US\">handful of apps</a> on Android phones, such as Apple Music, Move to iOS, and a Beats app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAndroid would join a long list of platforms where Apple's TV app is available, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, Roku and Amazon Fire TV streaming sticks, select smart TVs, and more. It is unclear when the app will be made available to the public, or if development has started.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/apple-tv-app-for-android-job-listing/\">Apple TV App Likely Coming to Android Smartphones, Job Listing Shows</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-app-likely-coming-to-android-smartphones-job-listing-shows.2427695/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82dcecd67e851f081b75ddb732ea49b520d16070a0affd91f0a19d47e5e315cf","category":"Apple"}
