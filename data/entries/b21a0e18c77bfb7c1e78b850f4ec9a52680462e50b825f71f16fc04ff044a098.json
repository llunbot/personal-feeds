Over the years, I’ve been slowly re-upping our archives when I want to add a back-link to a current post or story. That happened last week when writing about the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/10/an-ode-to-bicycle-touring-a-look-at-buckhorn-bags-new-made-in-new-mexico-waxed-panniers/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckhorn Bags Panniers</a>. I remembered our “Escaping Black Friday” Reportage and tracked down the film scans, allowing me to re-up the fun. I also added the RideWithGPS route to the archive as well. If you’re in the Austin, Texas area and are looking for a good (and difficult) road tour, don’t miss this one! </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2014/12/escaping-black-friday-bicycle-camping-bourbon-black-coffee/\" target=\"_blank\">Archive Re-Up: Escaping Black Friday with Bicycle Camping, Bourbon, and Black Coffee</a></p>\n<p>If there’s a story you remember and really would like to see re-posted, drop it in the comments!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b21a0e18c77bfb7c1e78b850f4ec9a52680462e50b825f71f16fc04ff044a098","category":"Cycling"}
