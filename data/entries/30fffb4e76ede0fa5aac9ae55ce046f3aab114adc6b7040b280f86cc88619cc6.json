{"title":"Hodinkee Sold to Watches of Switzerland","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/fashion/hodinkee-sale-watches-of-switzerland.html","date":1728055754000,"content":"\n<p>Victoria Gomelsky, reporting with absurd credulity for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hodinkee, the watch enthusiast website based in Manhattan that has\nhelped spread the gospel of mechanical watchmaking since its\nfounding in 2008, has a new owner.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, the Watches of Switzerland Group, one of the world’s\nlargest watch retailers with more than 220 multibrand and brand\nstores in Britain and the United States, announced that it had\nacquired the media company, which includes a website, a magazine,\na brand partnerships division and an insurance business. Neither\ncompany would disclose the terms of the deal. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Both Mr. Clymer and Mr. Hurley said Hodinkee’s staff, which now\ntotals about 35 people, would remain intact and that its editorial\nteam would remain independent of Watches of Switzerland oversight.</p>\n\n<p>“But at a point in time,” Mr. Hurley said, “when you click on the\nHodinkee Shop, you will see the full range of the product that\nWatchesofSwitzerland.com carries. We are going to do some work\nover the next several months to make that effectively seamless.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a name for a publication that is owned by a retailer: catalog. I’d love to be proven wrong and see Hodinkee return to excellence, but that seemed far more likely as an independent website than as a subsidiary of the world’s largest premium watch retailer. For years I read Hodinkee daily; for the last few years I largely stopped reading it at all.
