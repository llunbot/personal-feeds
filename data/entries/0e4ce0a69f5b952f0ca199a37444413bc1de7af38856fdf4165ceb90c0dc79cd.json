A U.S. judge today decided that the Google Play Store has an illegal monopoly, and Google has been ordered make multiple changes as a result, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-orders-google-open-up-app-store-competition-2024-10-07/\">Reuters</a></em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/play-store-google.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\nGoogle will need to allow Android users to download rival app stores like the ‌Epic Games‌ Store from within Google Play, plus it is required to allow third-party app stores to distribute Google Play apps, unless developers opt out of providing their apps through the alternative app stores.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFurther, Google can no longer require developers to use Google Pay Billing for apps that are sold through the Google Play Store, which means that app developers will be able to offer alternative payment methods that do not give Google a cut of app sales.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopers will also be able to link to alternative installation options in their apps, and will be able to let customers know about other ways to make purchases. Google is prohibited from offering carriers and device makers a financial incentive to preinstall the Play Store, and it is not able to offer developers money to launch their apps exclusively on the Play Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle can, however, charge a fee for \"reasonable measures\" that are implemented to preserve user safety and security related to apps and app stores downloaded through Google Play.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Epic Games‌ sued Google alongside Apple back in 2020, but the ‌Epic Games‌ v. Google lawsuit went differently from the ‌Epic Games‌ v. Apple lawsuit. While Apple won and was not declared a monopolist, Google lost to ‌Epic Games‌. Late last year, a nine-member jury <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/epic-wins-antitrust-trial-against-google/\">ruled in Epic Games' favor</a>, and said that Google had abused its power by charging developers unreasonable fees and operating an app store monopoly. While Google said that changes to the Play Store would be a hardship due to the time and money required, the judge overseeing the case was not swayed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle has to keep these changes in place for three years, starting on November 1, 2024. Google plans to appeal the ruling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle is still facing <em>another</em> ‌Epic Games‌ lawsuit, which was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/epic-games-sues-samsung-google/\">filed last week</a>. ‌Epic Games‌ accused Google and Samsung of colluding to prevent sideloading on Galaxy devices through the Auto Blocker safety feature, though ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney has confirmed that there is as of now no proof that the two companies worked together to limit sideloading on Samsung smartphones.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/google-alternative-app-store-support-android/\">Google Ordered to Support Alternative App Stores and Payment Methods in Play Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-ordered-to-support-alternative-app-stores-and-payment-methods-in-play-store.2439464/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0e4ce0a69f5b952f0ca199a37444413bc1de7af38856fdf4165ceb90c0dc79cd","category":"Apple"}
