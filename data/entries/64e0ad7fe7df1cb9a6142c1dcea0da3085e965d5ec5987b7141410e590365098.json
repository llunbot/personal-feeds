In February, the Biden administration ordered federal agencies to remove TikTok from government devices, and dozens of state governments have since passed similar bans on the app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTikTok has been in the cross-hairs of U.S. regulators for years, going back to the Trump administration's failed attempt to bar the app from U.S. app stores in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/28/judge-temporarily-blocks-us-tiktok-ban/\">September 2020</a>. Concerns over the app have heightened in recent months after both Republicans and Democrats called for officials to impose stricter data collection restrictions or ban the app from the U.S. entirely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn August 2022, ByteDance submitted a plan detailing how it plans to prevent the Chinese government from having access to data on U.S. users, and how it will offer the U.S. government oversight of the platform. However, discussions between TikTok and Washington on the issue have reportedly stalled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn related developments, TikTok is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64975672\">set to be banned</a> on phones used by British government ministers and civil servants, following a review by the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Center. Canada, Belgium, and the European Commission have already barred the app from government phones.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/\">TikTok</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/16/tiktok-us-ban-unless-china-sells-stake/\">TikTok Could Face US Ban Unless Chinese Owners Sell Stake</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-could-face-us-ban-unless-chinese-owners-sell-stake.2383859/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"64e0ad7fe7df1cb9a6142c1dcea0da3085e965d5ec5987b7141410e590365098","category":"Apple"}
