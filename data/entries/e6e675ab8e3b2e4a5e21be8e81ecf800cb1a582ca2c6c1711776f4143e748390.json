We mostly scan. That‚Äôs a reliable strategy to quickly find what we need in times when we‚Äôre confronted with more information than we can handle. But scanning also means that we often <strong>skip key details</strong>. This is not only inefficient but can also be very damaging to your business.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs explore how users read ‚Äî or scan ‚Äî on the web and how we can <strong>prevent harmful scanning patterns</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<p>This article is <strong>part of our ongoing series</strong> on <a href=\"/category/design-patterns\">design patterns</a>.

Users start at the top left, read a few lines, and then start to scan vertically. But it isn‚Äôt the only scanning pattern on the web. Being aware of different patterns is the first step to helping users better <strong>navigate your content</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/f-shape-pattern-how-users-read/1-different-scanning-patterns.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>Different patterns describe how users scan content on the web. The F-shape pattern is probably the best-known one.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/\">F-Pattern</a></strong><br />Users first read horizontally, then read less and less until they start scanning vertically. The first lines of text and the first words on each line receive more attention. It also applies to LTR-interfaces, but the F is flipped.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/layer-cake-pattern-scanning/\">Layer-Cake Pattern</a></strong><br />Users scan consistently across headings, with deliberate jumps into body text in between. Most effective way to scan pages and find key content details.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/love-at-first-sight-pattern/\">Love-at-First-Sight Pattern</a></strong><br />Users are often ‚Äúsatisficers,‚Äù searching for what‚Äôs good enough, not exhaustive enough. In search results, they often fixate on a single result.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/lawn-mower-pattern/\">Lawn-Mower Pattern</a></strong><br />In tables, users start in the top left cell, move to the right until the end of the row, and then drop down to the next row, moving in the same pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Spotted Pattern</strong><br />Skipping big chunks of text and focusing on patterns. Often happens in search when users look for specific words, shapes, links, dates, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Marking Pattern</strong><br />Eyes focus in one place as the mouse scrolls or a finger swipes. Common on mobile more than on desktop.</li>\n<li><strong>Bypassing Pattern</strong><br />Users deliberately skip the first words of the line when multiple lines start with the same word.</li>\n<li><strong>Commitment Pattern</strong><br />Reading the entire content, word by word. Happens when users are highly motivated and interested. Common for older adults.</li>\n</ul>\nF-Shape Scanning And The Lack Of Rhythm\n<p>On the web, we often argue about the fold, and while it does indeed exist, <a href=\"https://www.chrbutler.com/the-rhythm-of-your-screen\">it really doesn‚Äôt matter</a>. As Christopher Butler said, ‚Äú<strong>length is not the problem</strong> ‚Äî lack of rhythm is.‚Äù</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/f-shape-pattern-how-users-read/2-fold-user-attention.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>A designer‚Äôs main job is to <strong>direct attention intentionally</strong>. Scanning is partial attention. Reading is focused attention. A screen without intentional rhythm will lose attention as it is being scanned. One with <strong>controlled rhythm</strong> will not only retain attention, it will deepen it.</p>\n<p>Think of F-shape scanning as a <strong>user‚Äôs fallback behavior</strong> if the design doesn‚Äôt guide them through the content well enough. So prevent it whenever you can. At least, give users anchors to move to <em>E-shape scanning</em>, and at best, direct their attention to relevant sections with <strong>Layer-Cake scanning</strong>.</p>\nDirect Attention And Provide Anchors\n<p>Good formatting can <strong>reduce the impact of scanning</strong>. To structure scanning and guide a user‚Äôs view, add headings and subheadings. For engagement, alternate sizes, spacing, and patterns. For landing pages, alternate points of interest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/horizontal-attention-leans-left/\">Users spend 80% of the time viewing the left half of a page</a>. So, as you structure your content, keep in mind that horizontal attention leans left. That‚Äôs also where you might want to position navigation to aid wayfinding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/f-shape-pattern-how-users-read/3-user-attention-left-part-screen.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Generally, it‚Äôs a good idea to visually group small chunks of related content. To offer anchors, consider <strong>front-loading headings with keywords</strong> and key points ‚Äî it will help users quickly make sense of what awaits them. Adding useful visuals can also give users points to anchor to.</p>\n<p>Another way to guide users through the page is by adding <strong>few but noticeable accents</strong> to guide attention. You will need visible, well-structured headings and subheadings that stand out from the other content on the page. In fact, adding <strong>subheadings</strong> throughout the page might be the best strategy to help users find information faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Data-heavy content</strong> such as large, complex tables require some extra attention and care. To help users keep their position as they move across the table, keep headers floating. They provide an anchor no matter where your user‚Äôs eyes are focusing and make it easier to look around and compare data.</p>\nKey Takeaways\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Users spend 80% of time viewing the left half</strong> of a page.</li>\n<li>They read horizontally, then skip to content below.</li>\n<li><strong>Scanning is often inefficient</strong> as users miss large chunks of content and skip key details.</li>\n<li><strong>Good formatting</strong> reduces the impact of F-scanning.</li>\n<li><strong>Add heading and subheadings</strong> for structured scanning.</li>\n<li><strong>Show keywords and key points</strong> early in your headings to improve scanning.</li>\n<li>For engagement, <strong>alternate sizes, spacing, patterns</strong>.</li>\n<li>For landing pages, <strong>alternate points of interest</strong>.</li>\n<li>Visually group small <strong>chunks of related content</strong>.</li>\n<li>Keep <strong>headers floating</strong> in large, complex data tables.</li>\n<li>Add <strong>useful visuals</strong> to give users points to anchor to.</li>\n<li>Horizontal <strong>attention leans left</strong>: favor top/left navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/\">How People Read Online</a>, by Kate Moran</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/layer-cake-pattern-scanning/\">Layer-Cake Pattern of Scanning</a>, by Kara Pernice</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/horizontal-attention-leans-left/\">Horizontal Attention Leans Left</a>, by Therese B.
