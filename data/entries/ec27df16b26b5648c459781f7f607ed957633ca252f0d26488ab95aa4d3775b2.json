{"title":"Apple Dedicates Homepage to the Leader the U.S. Is Celebrating Today","link":"https://www.apple.com/","date":1737387593000,"content":"\n<p>Interesting selection of Martin Luther King Jr. quotes they’ve chosen for the homepage (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/apple.com-mlk-2025.pdf\">PDF archive for posterity</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li>“The function of education is to teach one to think intensively\nand to think critically.”</li>\n<li>“You must decide to speak for yourself; nobody else can speak\nfor you.”</li>\n<li>“We cannot preserve self without being concerned about\npreserving other selves.”</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Read into those quotes what you will, given today’s other national significance. I think there’s an implied message here, but it’s subtle. I’ll pick a different quote from King, one that I believe better speaks to the current moment:</p>\n\n<p>“The great majority of Americans are suspended between these opposing attitudes. They are uneasy with injustice but unwilling yet to pay a significant price to eradicate it.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ec27df16b26b5648c459781f7f607ed957633ca252f0d26488ab95aa4d3775b2","category":"Tech"}
