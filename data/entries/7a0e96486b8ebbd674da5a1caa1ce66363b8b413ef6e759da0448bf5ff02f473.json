That number might not be as high if your phone had a stunt double. It sounds ridiculous, but that’s what the <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features&amp;utm_term=scsf-608589&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002XOqWIAW&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">NanoPhone</a> brings to the table. This tiny phone works just like a regular smartphone, but but it’s durable, a fraction of the size, and a fraction of the price. Get one while they’re on sale for $89.97 instead of $299. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NanoPhone runs on Android 10, so you can still use the same apps you rely on every day. Stay connected abroad, or stream your favorite shows on the road, all without the worry that an untimely accident is going to ruin your month. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5MP rear camera and 2MP front camera are great for snapping clear photos, while GPS support and long battery life make it reliable when you need it most. So you can still get great vacation photos and navigate like a pro, but you don’t have to bring your brand-new iPhone into the wild with you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until January 12 at 11:59 p.m. PT, you can get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features&amp;utm_term=scsf-608589&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002XOqWIAW&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">NanoPhone</a> on sale for just $89.97.
