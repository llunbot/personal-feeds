It’s been a spectacular year on the racing stage, too – one we’ll all remember. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want all cyclists and cycling photographers to be a part of the Awards – to share your images, your moments, and your love of cycling from behind the lens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://form.typeform.com/to/r271Oaej\"><strong>Entries are open now</strong></a> for amateurs and professionals alike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You’re making a difference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mark Gunter Photographer of the Year Awards were established in the memory of Mark Gunter, a beloved Australian cycling photographer who died tragically young from oesophageal cancer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Awards will always be about making a difference – and this year, all entry fees raised are once again being donated to two important causes: cancer research and <a href=\"https://www.markgunter.com.au/2021/12/2021-young-cyclist-assistance-nominations-open\">Young Cyclists Assistance</a>. Entries are $25AUD (~US$17.50/€15.50), and you can submit up to three images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re proud to support Tour de Cure and one young cyclist – or maybe two if we raise more – who need a little financial help to take the next step in their cycling journey. The judge this year will be past recipient, Sarah Gigante.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every entry makes a difference, and we can’t thank you enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The purpose of the awards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before you enter the Awards, a note from Leeanne Gatien, Mark Gunter’s wife, the driving force behind the Awards. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>A little reminder of why we exist – to help others, to bring the cycling community together and to inspire others. And – for my son Lucas to share in Mark’s love of cycling and photography.</em></p><p><em><br />I’m so proud that this year Lucas joined the fight to raise money for cancer research by riding 100km for Tour de Kids and raised over AU$1,500.<br /></em></p><p><em>We’ve lost so many people to cancer and, sadly, it will continue. May your photos inspire others to get out, enjoy our natural environment and enter this year’s #markgunterphotoawards2021.</em></p><cite>Leeanne Gatien</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year images can be entered into one of two categories: Professional and Amateur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo has generously offered up some fantastic prizes for the top three Amateur winners in support of the competition, as they have for many years now:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1st Place: Wahoo KICKR</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Wahoo-Kickr-650x433.png\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2nd Place: Wahoo ELEMNT ROAM</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Wahoo-Roam-650x433.png\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3rd Place: Wahoo ELEMNT RIVAL</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wahoo_elemnt_rival_stealth_grey_wf140bk_frontleft_simpledigital_1.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re glad to confirm that we will continue to recognise the work of the Professional category by awarding the perpetual trophy for the winner, and medallions for the podium placers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/trophy-mgpa.jpg\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Judging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we’re thrilled to welcome <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jojoharper_/?hl=en\">Jojo Harper</a>, Albert Gallego Rabert (aka <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brazodehierro/?hl=en\">Brazo de Hierro</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jstartt/?hl=en\">James Startt</a> as our judges to adjudicate the competition.
