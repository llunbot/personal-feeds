But if the latest rumor is accurate, iPadOS 17 will feature the following options for iPads:\r<br />\n<ul><li>Lock Screen widgets</li>\r<br />\n<li>Wallpaper types such as Photo Shuffle, Emoji, and Weather</li>\r<br />\n<li>Photo tints and styles</li>\r<br />\n<li>Wallpaper depth effect</li>\r<br />\n<li>Clock style customization</li>\r<br />\n<li>Lock Screens linked to Focus Modes</li>\r<br />\n<li>Wallpapers gallery</li></ul>On Tuesday, a separate rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/ios-17-lock-screen-apple-music-rumors/\">claimed</a> that iOS 17 will bring new Lock Screen font size options to iPhones, as well as a button to share custom Lock Screen designs with other iPhone users. Leaker @analyst941 claims iPadOS 17 will also share \"tuned up\" Lock Screen customizations new to iOS 17, which could be a reference to the same tweaks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe anonymous source behind this rumor leaked accurate information about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/31/iphone-14-pro-camera-cutout-indicators/\">iPhone 14 Pro's Dynamic Island on the <em>MacRumors</em> Forums</a> before the device was announced last year. The same tipster leaked alleged details about new solid-state buttons coming on the iPhone 15 Pro models, but they have since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/analyst941/status/1649640818834124802?s=20\">withdrawn the claim and now agree with other sources</a> that the new buttons have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/\">pushed back to next year's Pro models</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, @analyst941 earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/ios-17-rumored-features/\">claimed</a> several other new features could be coming to the iPhone with iOS 17, including improvements to Search, the Dynamic Island, Control Center, and more. However, they do not have a long-term track record with rumors yet, so there is no guarantee the latest information they shared will prove to be accurate.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-16-lock-screen/\">iOS 16 Lock Screen Guide: Widgets, Customization Options and More</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple is expected to preview iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 during the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">WWDC 2023 keynote on June 5</a>.
