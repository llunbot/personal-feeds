As of yesterday, tough new US Treasury Department rules concerning the sourcing of electric vehicle batteries went into effect; as a result, most of the battery and plug-in hybrid EVs that were eligible for the Internal Revenue Service's clean vehicle tax credit until Sunday have now lost that eligibility.</p>\n<p>Under the federal government's previous program to incentivize the adoption of plug-in vehicles, it offered a tax credit, up to $7,500, based on the battery capacity of a BEV or PHEV, and once a car maker sold more than 200,000 plug-in vehicles, it lost eligibility for the tax credit—Only Tesla and General Motors reached this threshold.</p>\n<p>Changes came as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and went into effect at the start of 2023.
