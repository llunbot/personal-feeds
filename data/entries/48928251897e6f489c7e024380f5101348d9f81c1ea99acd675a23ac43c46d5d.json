Particularly \"astonishing,\" the letter said, was Nvidia's dominance in the market for GPU accelerator chips, which are at the heart of today's leading AI. Groups urged Kanter to probe Nvidia's business practices to ensure that rivals aren't permanently blocked from competing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040556#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040556&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"48928251897e6f489c7e024380f5101348d9f81c1ea99acd675a23ac43c46d5d","category":"Tech"}
