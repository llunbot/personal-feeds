{"title":"3D-printed Titanium Makes the POC Elicit Ti Sunglasses 1g Lighter","link":"https://bikerumor.com/poc-elicit-3d-printed-titanium-sunglasses/","date":1686078388000,"content":"<p>POC recently announced its “lightest sunglasses ever,” a titanium wire rig that beats its predecessor on the scale by one gram. Yes, just one gram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the Elicit Ti is technically the lightest sunglass POC has ever built. The wire earpieces are a “truss” design. Using titanium salvaged from used medical instruments under claims of sustainability, the company has officially defeated its previous lightest sunglass, the Elicit, by one gram — 23 to 22g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The savings represent <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/poc-elicit-clarity-are-their-lightest-ever-cycling-sunglasses-at-23-grams/\" target=\"_blank\">two years of progress</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1619eed7-795d-41d9-b5be-ab5c6a452106.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1619eed7-795d-41d9-b5be-ab5c6a452106.gif\" alt=\"a gif of a titanium manufacturing process\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/biking/budget-road-bike-blueprint-century\" target=\"_blank\">admittedly low-tech</a>, but the Swedish brand layers claims of curation onto the sunglasses in a way that’s so saccharine, so naked, there is no way not to lampoon it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a “perfect balance of rigidity and weight,” POC “creates a unique product with optimal stiffness, comfort, and balance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a rear triangle. It’s a pair of sunglasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-31-at-9.11.55-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-31-at-9.11.55-AM-800x483.png\" alt=\"poc elicit ti\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-31-at-9.11.55-AM-800x483.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-31-at-9.11.55-AM-297x179.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-31-at-9.11.55-AM-120x72.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-31-at-9.11.55-AM-768x464.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-31-at-9.11.55-AM.png 1196w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Team EF Education-EasyPost tested the Elicit Ti at the Giro d’Italia, and landed one rider in the top 50. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclists at large, though, responded avidly to the glasses. The special model was limited to just 365 pairs, and was sold out as of this writing (at $400 MSRP). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://na.pocsports.com/products/elicit-ti?variant=44111706357926\" target=\"_blank\">pocsports.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/poc-elicit-3d-printed-titanium-sunglasses/\">3D-printed Titanium Makes the POC Elicit Ti Sunglasses 1g Lighter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5c52954963e4b59dae65f6076139a650fde92f90942f46398f238c65f8c70f13","category":"Cycling"}
