The design consists of a big shackle and toughened crossbar with the lock mechanism built in. It has been around for years, and it’s really just a supersized padlock.</p>\n<p>The benefits are the strength for its size and relative portability. The downsides are the slightly awkward shape if you want to lock more of your bike into it. You’ll want to add in an accessory cable or second lock to cover everything.</p>\n<h4>Litelock X1</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Litelok X-1 bike lock\" title=\"Litelok X-1 bike lock - 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rated to Sold Secure’s highest standard, the X1 is nigh-on unbreakable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£150 / $179.99 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>1,600g</li>\n<li><strong>Shackle diameter: </strong>16mm</li>\n<li><strong>Size: </strong>210mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rating: </strong>Sold Secure Diamond</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Litelok X1 bike lock is nearly indestructible.

With a torsional resistance that’s 1,000Nm higher than its nearest rival, and tensile resistance that would handle a couple of vans pulling on each end, it’s impressive.</p>\n<p>Weather resistance is impeccable as is its resilience against picking. Under bolt cropping, it’s in the top three of all the locks we tested. If you prize your bike, have somewhere to store your lock when not using it, or want something tough for home use, then the Extreme is perfect.</p>\n<p>The high price is the only thing that holds it back from a full five-star review.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h4>Abus Granit X-Plus 540</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"lock-test-02-abus-granitx-1507036565705-4y7xt98ldafr-8d27070\" title=\"lock-test-02-abus-granitx-1507036565705-4y7xt98ldafr-8d27070\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Abus Granit X–Plus 540 is about as chunky as it gets.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £95 / $121 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 1,460g</li>\n<li><strong>Shackle diameter:</strong> 13mm (square)</li>\n<li><strong>Size: </strong>230mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rating:</strong> Sold Secure Gold</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The X-Plus 540 is one of the cleverest D-lock designs ever, with its patented square-profile shackle that resists torsional attacks better than most, taking a massive 1,750Nm of pressure.</p>\n<p>The state-of-the-art lock mechanism beat our lock picker, and has great resistance to bolt cropping (146kN) that far outweighs its relatively light weight.</p>\n<p>The quality of the materials and the build meant this one outlasted our corrosion test. The EaZy KF bracket took the full 200 hours of abuse. In cutting tests, it stripped the standard saw blade, and took more than two minutes of cutting with tungsten.

The New York scores with its resistance to bolt cropping, sawing (best on test), tensile (best on test) and torsional resistance (runner-up).</p>\n<p>With only its middling performance against the angle grinder going against it, the New York is a tough D-lock built the classic Kryptonite way.

It makes carrying easy thanks to the two built-in prongs that are designed to slip into your jeans pocket, or behind a belt. These ergonomic touches add a little extra to what is a solid-performing little lock.</p>\n<p>It’s built to last with excellent weather protection, and it’s a tough cookie when it comes to sawing, twisting and grinding. Only a lowly performance on the tensile (pull) test gave any cause for concern, but being able to withstand 28kN is more than enough to see off most compact, portable bottle jacks easily.</p>\n<p>The relatively shallow shackle is bolstered by a big 85mm width, so even with its compact size our tester was still able to safely get it through the frame and back wheel of their bike.

A standard blade sawed through the cables in 52 seconds and just 15 with a tungsten blade.</p>\n<p>The Litelok took a massive amount of abuse (222.5kN) from the bolt cropper.

But they’re a good additional lock if you’re leaving your bike locked up outside for extended periods of time.</p>\n<h4>Hiplok Homie</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"lock-test-12-hiplock-homie-1507040135247-5ro9nlh85yjs-cd6305d\" title=\"lock-test-12-hiplock-homie-1507040135247-5ro9nlh85yjs-cd6305d\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Hiplok Homie Chain Lock is ideal for home use.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £109.99 / $103 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 4,200g</li>\n<li><strong>Link size:</strong> 10mm round links</li>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> 150cm</li>\n<li><strong>Rating:</strong> Sold Secure Gold</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Homie, at 1.5m long, is designed to thread through multiple bikes, and as the name suggests, is for home use.</p>\n<p>The individual links are made from hardened steel, as is the shackle to protect the cylinder lock.</p>\n<p>When using the Homie, be careful not to drop it onto a frame tube because that 4.2kg of weight will cause some damage.</p>\n<p>The Homie is well protected against corrosion and hammer tests didn’t affect it either.

Armed with the right tools and knowledge, someone who really wants to steal your bike will be able to, no matter what you lock it up with.</p>\n<p>Whether your pride and joy is one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">best road bikes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a>, it’s unwise to ever leave it unattended outside – even secured by the best bike lock. The temptation could be too much to a thief.</p>\n<p>What you can do is deter the bike thief looking for an easy steal. With that in mind, one of the best bits of advice we can give you, after many years of busting and picking locks in our tests, is to use two locks of different types and brands.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Litelok X-1 bike lock\" title=\"Litelok X-1 bike lock - 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Stability when carried on the bike is essential.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If a thief is adept at picking a certain type of lock and has the tools to do so, it’s less likely they will also have the tools or the knowledge to pick a completely different type.</p>\n<p>Two budget locks that are wildly different in style and key/lock-cylinder types are sometimes better than just one expensive lock. Here’s a breakdown of all the key lock lingo that you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key:</strong> There are various types of keys, but all work a lock mechanism by moving pins or discs into alignment to allow the lock plug to be turned and open the lock</li>\n<li><strong>Shackle:</strong> We know the shackle as the D-shaped part of a D-lock/U-lock or padlock. It shackles two things together. In our case, it’s our bikes to something sturdy</li>\n<li><strong>Links:</strong> Chains are made up of links; hoops joined together. The smaller the internal diameter of the links the better, as this gives less space for a lever that can be used to break the link to be inserted</li>\n<li><strong>Protection:</strong> Nobody wants a bare metal lock clattering against their frame. A cloth or sponge cover is handy to keep your pride and joy looking nice and to prevent the lock from corroding</li>\n<li><strong>Lock barrel:</strong> Manufacturers will centre the lock mechanism in the barrel. Check the weight of the barrel because if it’s heavy that’s a sure sign it’s armoured</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple keys:</strong> Multiple keys are essential, with manufacturers such as OnGuard offering up to five with a lock. Keep one at home, one at work and one on your keyring</li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Check the action of the mechanism because locks spend most of their lives outdoors, so corrosion can be a problem. Use a light lube or water repellent (GT-85 or WD-40) liberally and top up periodically</li>\n<li><strong>Warranty:</strong> An extended warranty is always good. It’s not going to cover you against theft but it should be a sign that the lock won’t fall apart or seize up on you</li>\n<li><strong>Anti-theft guarantee:</strong> This guarantee is a form of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/compare-best-bicycle-insurance/\">insurance</a> pioneered by Kryptonite. It does bump up the price, but definitely adds peace of mind into the package</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we tested the bike locks</h2>\n\n<p>Over the two decades that we’ve been putting together our intensive and independent lock tests, we’ve always used a combination of manual and power tools, and force and finesse to try to break locks.</p>\n<p>Back in 2017, we used the facilities of Germany’s biggest security manufacturer, Abus, and more importantly its state-of-the-art test labs.</p>\n<p>We devised a full-on torture chamber of tests that fully simulated each and every way a lock can be attacked and broken. For this, we needed multiple models from each manufacturer, so thank you to those who took up the challenge and supplied test samples willingly.</p>\n<p>With nine tests on a total of 29 different models (seven of which are reviewed in this article), that’s 261 separate tests, and a total of in excess of £11,000 worth of locks tested to destruction.</p>\n<h3>Bracket test</h3>\n<p>Some of the locks come with a handy bracket to fit to your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/whats-the-best-bike-for-commuting/\">commuter bike</a>. We tested the brackets fixed to a bike that’s attached to a treadmill, with bumps and lumps to simulate road conditions. This ‘rattle’ test runs for a total of 200 hours, which is plenty of time to see if the bracket is up to the job of carrying your lock safely.</p>\n<h3>Corrosion test</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Image showing d-lock bike locks hanging from a bar in a tank where they are being put through a corrosion test\" title=\"lock-test-open6-1507036565783-agqn6w89p6bo-1508275646006-1upd1gq0ud9dw-6822a45\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Our corrosion test replicated a year-long hard life outdoors.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>One of each lock was subjected to 168 hours in a climate chamber to ISO 9227 standards. The time is equivalent to around 10 to 12 months of outdoor use in a salty-air environment, such as living on the coast. Over the 168 hours, temperature and humidity fluctuate to further simulate real-world conditions.</p>\n<h3>Freeze and hammer test</h3>\n<p>This test simulates the use of a plumber’s freeze spray, which chills the metal. The theory is it’ll make metal more brittle when struck with a hammer. Our test lab consists of a chiller cabinet that freezes the lock down to -40°C. It’s then struck with a weight simulating a full-force sledgehammer blow multiple times from 1m and 2m.</p>\n<h3>Saw test</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"670\" height=\"446\" alt=\"Locks were subjected to a standard saw blade and a tungsten item\" title=\"lock-test-open5-1507036565780-629vetubprid-1508275646006-1a5cdaj6lfyez-ac0714f\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Locks were subjected to a standard saw blade and a tungsten item.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>Our test machine is an articulated saw. Each lock was cut first with a fresh, standard steel blade. If it survived that test, it was then cut with a high-quality, precision tungsten blade in the same saw.</p>\n<h3>Bolt crop test</h3>\n<p>The bolt cropper is perhaps the favourite tool of the modern bike thief. Short, concealable bolt croppers are available for very little cash and can get through most budget locks with little fuss. Higher-standard locks are much tougher, and those that cross over into motorcycle security are stronger still.</p>\n<p>Our bolt-cropping rig has to be capable of out-performing hand-operated bolt croppers, so the one we’ve used is a hydraulic jaw that cuts like a bolt cropper, but is capable of applying in excess of 250 kiloNewtons of pressure. That’s around the equivalent of a 1.5m-long set of bolt croppers operated by a couple of contestants from World’s Strongest Man.</p>\n<h3>Tensile pull test</h3>\n<p>This pulling rig had to simulate the bottle jack approach to breaking locks. A small hydraulic bottle uses a jack to push apart the two sections of lock, breaking the mechanism and causing the lock to fail. Our hydraulic test rig does the same by pulling on both parts simultaneously. This rig is capable of more than seven tonnes of pulling power, while your average bottle jack can perform to around three.</p>\n<h3>Torsion test</h3>\n<p>The good-old torsion attack, or crowbar to you and me, is a very effective method, but the downside is it usually leaves the bike being stolen with significant damage.</p>\n<p>Our test rig can torsionally twist a lock to massive pressures, the equivalent of using a crowbar of more than 1.5m and one of those world’s strongest men doing the crowing.</p>\n<h3>Picking test</h3>\n<p>Picking locks is a learnable art and with many ‘picks’ available online we are seeing a rise in bikes being stolen this way. We used a resident expert armed with an inexpensive homemade pick to try to open the locks on test.</p>\n<h3>Grinder test</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sparks flew as the angle grinder was introduced\" title=\"lock-test-open3-1507036565735-1v2v46wbtd1d3-1508275574148-d0ocfs479gp2-5d11b71\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’ve got the full lowdown on lock performance after rigorous testing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>Hand-held powerful battery-operated angle grinders are a fast and effective way to cut through metal. However, they do generate a lot of noise and sparks, so if you park your bike in a high traffic area, and not hidden out of sight, you’re less likely to see this method of attack being used in broad daylight.</p>\n<p>For our test, we used an off-the-shelf unit, with multiple batteries and a constant cycle of recharging, along with a fresh grinding disc for each test, so that each lock had the exact same conditions to record the time it took to cut through.</p>\n<h2>How to lock a bike</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"How to lock a bike\" title=\"How to lock a bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Looping the lock through the frame and the front wheel is a good way to stop any thieves from making off with your wheel, and reduce leverage space.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s nothing worse than coming back to where you left your bike to find that someone has stolen it.</p>\n<p>Investing in one of the best bike locks is an ideal first step to stopping this from happening, but there are also other things to bear in mind when locking your bike up to make sure it stays safe.</p>\n<p>Firstly, you always want to lock your bike to a secure anchor point, such as a bike stand and avoid locking it to things like posts where a thief could simply lift the bike and lock off the top.</p>\n<p>Choosing a location where there are plenty of people around is good too, as it will (hopefully) give thieves less time to break a lock before someone intervenes.</p>\n<p>A good tip is to also use a second lock, or cable, to secure your wheels because it is relatively easy for a thief to remove these and make off with them.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Litelok X1 and X3 D-locks for road bikes\" title=\"Litelok - lightest locks news - X1 and X3\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Avoid using two locks from the same company.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Litelok</i></span></div>\n<p>If you do use a second lock, it’s a good idea to get one that’s a different make to your first one. this is because some thieves might be adept at picking one brand and not another, or have a particular tool that could cut through one type of lock but not another.</p>\n<p>If someone does want to try and break your lock, you want to make it difficult for them. Keep the locks off the ground so thieves can’t use the leverage to prise the lock open, and fit the lock tightly around the bike to also reduce the amount of leverage required to break it.</p>\n<p>You can read more tips in our article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-lock-a-bike/\">how to lock a bike properly</a>.</p>\n<p>Keeping a bike inside is obviously one of the safest ways to keep it safe and we have an article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/improve-your-bike-shed-security-whatever-your-budget/\">how to improve your bike shed security</a>.</p>\n<h2>Where to put a bike lock while riding</h2>\n<p>There are several places you can put a lock while riding your bike.</p>\n<p>Many of the best bike locks will come with a mount. These are intended to attach to your bike frame. It’s a good idea to use the mount to hold the lock in the front triangle of the bike.</p>\n<p>If your bike’s front triangle is obstructed by bottle cages and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a>, you can affix the mount to another part of your bike, but make sure it doesn’t interfere with any moving parts or limit manoeuvrability.</p>\n<p>You can always carry a bike lock in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-pannier-bags/\">pannier bag</a> or rucksack.
