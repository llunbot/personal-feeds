The speech was given <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwstKnhWs6k\">at Web Summit 2021</a> in Lisbon, Portugal, and it expands on earlier, similar statements <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/apples-tim-cook-sideloading-is-not-in-the-best-interests-of-the-user/\">from Apple CEO Tim Cook</a>.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is actively discussing the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is intended to regulate big tech platforms to ensure a fair playing ground. Companies like Apple could face fines of up to 10 percent of their global revenue.</p>\n<p>In its current proposed form, the DMA would force Apple to begin allowing sideloading on the iPhone or face such fines. Federighi called the DMA out specifically in his speech, briefly voicing support for it overall but singling out the sideloading provision in almost apocalyptic terms.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810396#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810396&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"401f9f9e1a7a8de5316ed0a1105a0c55afcb06f3b4418dde89295592f995c9d1","category":"Tech"}
