It seems like every couple of months, the brand drops something <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-3d-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-fits-more-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">3D-printed from Titanium</a> or some other slick upgrade simply intended to make your bike perform better. From <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-launches-elettrico-micro-ultimate-electric-pumps-u-s-misses-out-due-to-tariffs/\" target=\"_blank\">electric inflators</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-stripchip-ultimate-chain-wax-system-makes-chain-waxing-easier-than-ever/\" target=\"_blank\">chain waxing systems</a> to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-plans-to-pay-sponsored-racers-bonus-if-they-flat-with-new-ultimate-sealant/\" target=\"_blank\">tire sealant</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-aero-socks-get-taller-more-colorful-plus-new-schradero-chucks/\" target=\"_blank\">Aero socks</a>, the self-proclaimed “<em>leader in marginal gains</em>” continues to make products that may, in fact, provide marginal gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Silca Synergetic Race Grease</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest product in this pursuit of performance is <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66154X1653891xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilca.cc%2Fproducts%2Fsynergetic-race-grease\" target=\"_blank\">Synergetic Race Grease</a>. This new grease combines elements of other recent Silca tech innovations, like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-synergetic-wet-lube-promises-to-redefine-how-fast-chain-oil-can-be/\" target=\"_blank\">Synergetic Chain Lubricant</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-speedchip-endurancechip-chain-wax-faster-or-more-durable/\" target=\"_blank\">SpeedChip</a> wax, to create a low-viscosity workshop grease. According to Silca, the same synthetic wax technology from SpeedChip is used to thicken their Synergetic Lube into a grease that includes the “<em>low friction, nanoscale WS2 additive package used in both</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silca claims this new grease “<em>represents a new echelon of lubrication combining the low-friction properties of oil-based lubricants, with the pressure capabilities and wear resistance of thicker greases</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-front.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"930\" height=\"1395\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-front.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the front of the tube of Silca Synergetic Race Grease\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-front.webp 930w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-front-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-front-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-front-768x1152.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Front of the grease tube makes the claims</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-rear.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"844\" height=\"1266\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-rear.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the back of the tube of Silca Synergetic Race Grease\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-rear.webp 844w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-rear-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-rear-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silca-Synergetic-Race-Grease-tube-rear-768x1152.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Back of the tube tells the story</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Claimed Benefits of Synergetic Race Grease</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Up to 50% Reduction in Friction:</strong> Improves mechanical efficiency in bearings and bushings</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Up to 90% Reduction in Wear:</strong> Extends the operational life of precision components</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extreme Load Stability:</strong> Resists displacement under heavy use, extending required maintenance intervals</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Low Friction Characteristics</strong>: Optimized for both sliding and rotational surfaces</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Torque Control:</strong> Enables consistent clamping forces without over-tightening when used as assembly grease   </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Formulation Purity:</strong> Free of unnecessary dyes or additives that could compromise interface integrity </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Made in the USA</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand doesn’t specify which products they were comparing Synergetic Race Grease to when calculating the friction and wear reduction percentages listed above, so we’d have to assume some standard multi-purpose synthetic cycling grease. Those are bold claims, though. And realistically, even if it’s just half that, it may potentially provide tangible benefits in efficiency and longevity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its new Synergetic Race Grease, Silca also closes the loop and allows brand loyalists and marginal gains enthusiasts to use Silca products for everything from bike builds to regular cleaning &amp; maintenance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66154X1653891xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilca.cc%2Fproducts%2Fsynergetic-race-grease\" target=\"_blank\">Silca Synergetic Race Grease</a> comes in a 100cc tube (3.38oz/95.82g). It retails for $25 / 30€ and is available now through Silca’s website now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://silca.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Silca.cc</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-launches-new-synergetic-race-grease/\">Silca’s Synergetic Race Grease Turns Wax Lube Into Grease to Keep Your Bearings Spinning</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ab8bf1ebe80ab55fa91e9b74d025d3afab26ef3997b44fe228f33a926a5895f3","category":"Cycling"}
