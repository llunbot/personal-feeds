As XPLR is 1x-specific, if Roglič wanted to use that cassette, he needed to switch to a single-chainring by default. SRAM offers 38t to 46t chainrings for XPLR as standard, though we don’t know what size chainring Roglič opted for in Italy.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, stage 19 represented a brutal day in the Dolomites, with more than 5,400m of ascent over the 183km parcours, and three climbs going above 2,000m in elevation.</p>\n<div>But big days in the mountain are par for the course in a Grand Tour – and we never see riders reach for a cassette as big as Roglič’s on stage 19 – so why else might the Slovenian have switched to his XPLR-equipped bike?</div>\n<h2>A test ahead of stage 20?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Stage 20 profile\" title=\"Stage 20 profile\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Stage 20 of the 2023 Giro d’Italia looks brutal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RCS Sport</i></span></div>\n<p>With that in mind, it’s possible Roglič had more pragmatic reasons for switching to the unusual setup.</p>\n<p>Stage 20 of this year’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/giro-ditalia/\">Giro d’Italia</a> is an 18.6km individual time trial. After a flat opening half, the final 9.8km of the stage ascends 1,050m with gradients kicking up as steep as 22 per cent.</p>\n<p>We expect many teams will swap to a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">climbing bike</a> at the base of the climb.</p>\n<p>It’s possible Roglič wanted to trial the super-low gearing of his 1x setup in a – relatively – low-pressure setting ahead of using it in the penultimate stage of this year’s race. It’s there that the 10-44t cassette may come to the fore.</p>\n<p>Roglič finished stage 19 in fourth place, knocking three seconds off of Geraint Thomas’ GC (Ineos Grenadiers) lead, and goes into the time trial 26 seconds behind the race leader.</p>\n<h2>A 1x renaissance?</h2>\n<p>Though they’ve become very common in time trials, it’s fair to say 1x road bike drivetrains have seen mixed success.</p>\n<p>Aqua Blue Sport raced exclusively on 1x drivetrains until the team folded in 2018, with some riders specifically blaming the team’s downfall on its early adoption of single-ring drivetrains.</p>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wout van Aert to race on 1x at Milan-San Remo\" title=\"Wout van Aert to race on 1x at Milan-San Remo\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wout van Aert to raced on 1x at Milan-San Remo.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wout van Aert / Instagram</i></span></div>\n<p>However, 2023 has seen something of a renaissance for 1x drivetrains. As we’ve already mentioned, Roglič’s teammate, Wout van Aert, lined up for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/wout-van-aert-1x/\">Milan-San Remo onboard a single ring Cervélo S5</a>.</p>\n<p>Other riders have also experimented with 1x drivetrains. Victor Campenaerts’ (Lotto–Dstny) raced the Opening Weekend of the Spring Classics on a 1x Ridley Noah Fast, though he paired that with a 2-speed Classified internal gear hub.</p>\n<p>While we think <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/1x-on-road-bikes/\">an all-out 1x drivetrain takeover is unlikely</a>, it’s clear some teams and riders feel a single-ring setup offers advantages in certain scenarios.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8c58549a1715531313d7c378ae32fd489834275ed3ed22e7f0c9b4fadb5339a1","category":"Cycling"}
