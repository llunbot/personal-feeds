Now, Nintendo-watchers are pointing to a fleeting mention of \"Switch 2 Edition games\" as a major hint that such enhancements are in the works for at least some original Switch games.</p>\n<p>The completely new reference to \"Switch 2 Edition games\" comes from <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/\">a Nintendo webpage</a> discussing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/\">yesterday's newly announced Virtual Game Cards</a> digital lending feature. In the fine print at the bottom of that page, Nintendo notes that \"Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games <em>and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</em> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system [emphasis added].\"</p>\n<p>The specific wording differentiating these \"Switch 2 Edition\" games from \"Switch 2 exclusives\" suggests a new category of game that is compatible with the original Switch but able to run with enhancements on the Switch 2. But it's currently unclear what Switch games will get \"Switch 2 Edition\" releases or how much developer work (if any) will be needed to create those new versions.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendo-hints-at-enhanced-switch-2-edition-games-for-new-console/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendo-hints-at-enhanced-switch-2-edition-games-for-new-console/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30df3c0a0125e9feaaed4024b4eb595f60430b95eb66b54c78fa239287a5e127","category":"Tech"}
