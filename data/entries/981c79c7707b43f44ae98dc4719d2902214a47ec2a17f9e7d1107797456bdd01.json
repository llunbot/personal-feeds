At least 16 people have been hospitalized, eight have lost vision, and four have had their eyeballs surgically removed (enucleation). One person has died, which was reported earlier.</p>\n<p>The agency first released <a href=\"https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00485.asp\">a health alert</a> on the outbreak February 1. At that point, the outbreak had sickened 55 people in 12 states, with the one death reported in a Washington patient. In an update emailed to Ars on February 22, the CDC said the case count had reached 58, with five cases of vision loss and one enucleation.</p>\n<p>The continued rise in cases and severe outcomes highlights the challenge of fighting the germ behind the outbreak, which is an extensively drug-resistant form of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. It has the unwieldy name of Verona Integron-mediated Metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and Guiana-Extended Spectrum-β-Lactamase (GES)-producing carbapenem-resistant <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>—or VIM-GES-CRPA, for short.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924459#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924459&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"981c79c7707b43f44ae98dc4719d2902214a47ec2a17f9e7d1107797456bdd01","category":"Tech"}
