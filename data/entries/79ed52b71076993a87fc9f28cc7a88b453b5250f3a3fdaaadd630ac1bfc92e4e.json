So quiet are electric vehicles, in fact, that <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/14/2016-28804/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-minimum-sound-requirements-for-hybrid-and-electric-vehicles\">federal vehicle safety regulations</a> require EVs (and hybrids) to make a certain amount of noise at lower speeds to warn vulnerable road users like blind or visually impaired pedestrians of their presence.</p>\n<p>Almost all of those cars end up sounding like a choir of depressed angels, a phrase memorably coined by either Richard Porter or Jonny Smith on the <em>Smith and Sniff</em> podcast. That's not the case with the forthcoming electric Dodge Charger, however. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/dodge-debuts-the-2024-electric-charger-daytona-with-670-horsepower/\">When it first broke cover in March</a>, we learned that the electric Charger would feature something called a \"Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust\" to give it some aural character. Now, thanks to the video from Dodge embedded here, we can all hear what that sounds like in practice:</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n        Dodge knows that emotion is a big part of muscle car sales, so it's made the electric Charger sound very emotional.    </div>\n        <figcaption>\n        <div>Dodge knows that emotion is a big part of muscle car sales, so it's made the electric Charger sound very emotional. </div>\n    </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p>The Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust—<a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/features/what-is-the-fratzog-logo/\">the name refers</a> to a Dodge logo—<a href=\"https://moparinsiders.com/how-does-dodges-fratzonic-chambered-exhaust-work/\">combines</a> various chambers underneath the Charger's body with some woofers and mid-range speakers, all driven by a dedicated 600 W amplifier. The system is also designed to transmit vibrations into the chassis through elastomeric bushings, mimicking an internal combustion engine and its motor mounts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042189#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042189&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
