It was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/\">rumored</a> that Apple might apply similar limitations to the USB-C port on iPhone 15 models, but this report confirms that is not the case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with iPads and Macs with USB-C ports, the report said all existing USB cables, chargers, and accessories will work normally with the iPhone 15 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs the report notes, it is still possible that Apple will launch a \"Made for iPhone\" certification program for iPhone accessories with a USB-C port, but it appears that uncertified accessories will work just fine with the devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models are equipped with a USB-C port, but there are differences in data transfer speeds. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-port-limited-to-lightning-speeds/\">limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds</a> of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to Lightning, while the iPhone 15 Pro models support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/\">accepting pre-orders</a> for all four iPhone 15 models earlier today. The devices launch on Friday, September 22.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-usb-c-port-completely-standard/\">iPhone 15 Models Have 'Completely Standard' USB-C Port Without Restrictions on Accessories</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-have-completely-standard-usb-c-port-without-restrictions-on-accessories.2401964/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6fc8eff470c28aebfd9372475e22b058c98c8ab01cff58c28ab3da6917b8ed81","category":"Apple"}
