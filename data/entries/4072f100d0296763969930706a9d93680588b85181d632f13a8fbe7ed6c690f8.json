Claude 3 Sonnet is two times faster and has the same level of intelligence as Anthropic’s highest-performing models, Claude 2 and Claude 2.1. My favorite characteristic is that Sonnet is better at producing JSON outputs, making it simpler for developers to build applications. It also offers vision capabilities. You can learn more about this foundation model (FM) in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-sonnet-foundation-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\">the post that Channy wrote</a> early last week.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS re:Post</strong> – Launched last week! <a href=\"https://repost.aws/articles/ARdenvsn6VQbOf1K1IruVeFg\" target=\"_blank\">AWS re:Post Live</a> is a weekly <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/aws\" target=\"_blank\">Twitch livestream</a> show that provides a way for the community to reach out to experts, ask questions, and improve their skills. The show livestreams every Monday at 11 AM PT.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/cloudwatch-metric-streams-streaming-daily-metrics/\" target=\"_blank\">Now streams daily metrics on CloudWatch metric streams</a>. You can use metric streams to send a stream of near real-time metrics to a destination of your choice.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/amazon-ec2-c7gd-m7gd-r7gd-metal-instances/\" target=\"_blank\">Announced the general availability of new metal instances, C7gd, M7gd, and R7gd</a>. These instances have up to 3.8 TB of local NVMe-based SSD block-level storage and are built on top of the AWS Nitro System.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS WAF</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/aws-waf-rate-based-rules-configurable-time-windows/\" target=\"_blank\">Now supports configurable evaluation time windows for request aggregation with rate-based rules</a>. Previously, AWS WAF was fixed to a 5-minute window when aggregating and evaluating the rules. Now you can select windows of 1, 2, 5 or 10 minutes, depending on your application use case.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Partners</strong> – Last week, we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/aws-generative-ai-competency-partners/\" target=\"_blank\">announced the AWS Generative AI Competency Partners.</a> This new specialization features AWS Partners that have shown technical proficiency and a track record of successful projects with generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered by AWS.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\" target=\"_blank\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What’s New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span><br /> Some other updates and news that you may have missed:</p> \n<p>One of the articles that caught my attention recently <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/comparing-design-approaches-for-building-serverless-microservices/\" target=\"_blank\">compares different design approaches for building serverless microservices</a>. This article, written by Luca Mezzalira and Matt Diamond, compares the three most common designs for serverless workloads and explains the benefits and challenges of using one over the other.</p> \n<p>And if you are interested in the serverless space, you shouldn’t miss the <a href=\"https://serverlessland.com/office-hours\" target=\"_blank\">Serverless Office Hours</a>, which airs live every Tuesday at 10 AM PT.
