The original MSRP was $329 and it’s usually on sale for $249, but today you can get it even cheaper: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6/\">Amazon has slashed the raining stock of the 64GB iPad to $224</a>, a savings of over $100 and the best price we’ve ever seen. The 256GB model is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G96TFF7/\">also on sale for $119 off</a> bringing the price down to $360.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9th-gen iPad has a 10.2-inch display, an A13 chip, and a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage. It’s the only iPad you can buy with a Home button and a Lightning port and is great for kids and students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know how much stock Amazon has, so if you want a great tablet at a great price, go grab it right now.</p>\n\n\n<span>The 9th-gen iPad is down to $224.</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6/\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7aadb24045bc807aa0add7c5379da45cc576dc79fea9192919dfbeae1f5d2c9a","category":"Apple"}
