When it’s chugging away, inflating your tire, it is borderline obnoxiously loud. But, now you don’t have to hold it to make it work. And it feels so much better than blasting one-time use CO2 cartridges. Plus, it’s actually smaller &amp; lighter than the CO2 setup I would have carried.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, let’s get to the details…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator pump</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, on a trail bike tire's presta valve\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_press-onto-presta-valve-and-let-it-go-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Muc-Off already had a mini battery-powered electric inflator, but they wanted to make it better. Higher power, bigger battery, improved usability. From a form factor standpoint, it is mostly the same as the AirMach inflator that Muc-Off debuted<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/muc-off-airmach-electric-mini-bike-tire-inflator/\" target=\"_blank\"> just last autumn</a>, just a tiny bit bigger. But functionally, it’s so much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key update is that it now includes an LED display, which seems like an absolute minimum requirement in hindsight. That means that it displays real-time tire pressure and battery level status. But more importantly, that lets you preset your desired air pressure, so it stops automatically. That means you can set it, press it onto your valve stem, they let go so you don’t always need to lean over with your ear right next to this little guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, pre-adjust pressure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_pre-adjust-pressure-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the new display and auto cutoff functions, the updated Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator can now pump your tires up to 120psi, a 20% improvement. It also now has a 50% bigger 450mAh battery inside. That means that it is now rated to fill up to 4 (road) tires on a single charge. Then, it takes just 30 minutes to recharge via USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, 142g actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_142g-actual-weight-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To fit that extra power, it is now about 7cm x 7cm x 3.5cm, counting its soft cover and pink valve chuck, and it weighs 142g. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, all alloy construction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_all-alloy-construction-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This little electric pump has a full aluminum body (no cheap plastic bits) but comes covered with a silicone sleeve which you need to not burn your fingers as it gets quite hot pumping tires up to high pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It features a knurled alloy head in classic Muc-Off magenta. And this new Pro version also includes an air hose extender that you need to use on plastic valves and TPU tubes to prevent melting them. It also comes with a ball inflation needle and a nozzle for pumping up other inflatables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions with the Muc-Off AirMach Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, lighter &amp; smaller than CO2 setup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_snaller-abd-lighter-than-CO2-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when I got a hold of the new Muc-Off AirMach Pro inflator, I was pretty psyched that this tiny thing was going to be the end of mini-pumps and CO2 for me. But then I wondered where I would carry it. The body is just 7x5x3.5cm, but the chuck extends that out a couple extra centimeters, making it an oddly boxy form factor to carry on the bike. It’s smaller than 2 CO2 cartridges and an inflator, and lighter (92g for that 25g MTB can, 61g for the road 16g one &amp; 25g for the inflator) but a less flexible shape to pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, fits in teh palm of my hand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_palm-sized-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It fits easily in hand, and in a bigger hydration pack or any bikepacking-type bag. But it kinda made me rethink how I packed any small saddlebag. And there’s no real good on-bike strap/hostler mounting solution, nor will it fit easily in some internal frame storage setups. I settled on putting it in a frame pack or the versatile Restrap <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/restrap-tool-pouch-carries-all-your-spares-in-heavy-duty-mini-saddlebag-first-rides/\" target=\"_blank\">Tool Pouch</a>, which is plenty big enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_set-it-and-forget-it.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_set-it-and-forget-it.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, press it on an let it inflate\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_set-it-and-forget-it.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_set-it-and-forget-it-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_set-it-and-forget-it-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_set-it-and-forget-it-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_set-it-and-forget-it-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I turned it on and realized that I wouldn’t throw away my mini-pump. This thing is louder than my iPhone blasting Master of Puppets at full volume. Luckily, I can set the pressure, set it on my valve, and run away somewhere quieter while it inflates. But you seriously can’t have a trailside chat with your riding buddies while this is chugging away.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ongoing AirMach Pro Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_dialing-in-low-pressures.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_dialing-in-low-pressures.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, adjustable low-pressure range\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_dialing-in-low-pressures.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_dialing-in-low-pressures-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_dialing-in-low-pressures-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_dialing-in-low-pressures-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_dialing-in-low-pressures-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, it does its job really well. And I don’t get tired pumping tires. I even managed to seat and set up a couple of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/continental-terra-adventure-review-all-new-gravel-tire-shifts-focus-for-mtb-inspired-off-road-racing/\" target=\"_blank\">new gravel tires</a> tubeless with it on a single charge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the simple precision of the gauge, so I used it quite a bit for late season fat biking where every single psi makes a big difference when you are searching for grip in soft snow and mud. Now, with wet loamy and sometimes muddy trails after the snow has gone, I’m fine-tuning trail bike tire pressures to hunt grip in changing conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, fat bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_wet-snowy-fat-biking-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s so easy to set the pressure I want, pop the Muc-Off AirMach Pro onto the valve, and let it do its thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for number of tire inflations on a single charge… I had no problem pumping two 45mm gravel tires from no air to 35psi with at least 1/3 of battery remaining. I also pumped two 2.4″ 29er trail tires up to 24psi with a bit of power remaining. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, that means it easily replaces two CO2 cartridges. And I don’t end up with an empty metal cartridge to recycle or dispose of after I’m done. A quick recharge and it’s ready to go again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It obviously won’t replace a mini-pump that works for as many flat tires as you can imagine, or for longer adventure rides. But for everyday riding as a backup, this is my new go-to!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator – Pricing &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents.webp\" alt=\"Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator tire pump Review, contents \n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Muc-Off-AirMach-Electric-Mini-Pro-Inflator-pump_contents-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Muc-Off AirMach Electric Mini Pro Inflator sells for £100 / $140 / 115€ and goes <a href=\"https://muc-off.com/products/airmach-electric-mini-inflator-pro\" target=\"_blank\">on sale today</a>.
