Today's story features another EV designed and built by students, this time from the Technical University of Munich, and they took a lot longer to set the record.</p>\n<p>The car, called muc22, looks more conventional than the Swiss speedster, if only a little. The diminutive coupe in this case was built for efficiency, and in a six-day test at Munich airport, it set a new distance record on a single charge (for a non-solar EV): 1,599 miles (2,574 km), with less battery capacity than many plug-in hybrids—just 15.5 kWh.</p>\n<p>The specs for muc22 are extreme, but they're on the far other side of the scale compared to something like a Pininfarina Battista hypercar. For one thing, the streamlined EV has a top speed of just 26 mph (42 km/h) and weighs just 374 lbs (170 kg) without a driver. The airflow-optimized shape has faired-in rear wheels and a drag coefficient of just 0.159; more importantly, though, it has a pretty tiny frontal area (it's only 39.4 inches/1,000 mm tall and 47.2 inches/1,200 mm wide).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968385#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968385&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
