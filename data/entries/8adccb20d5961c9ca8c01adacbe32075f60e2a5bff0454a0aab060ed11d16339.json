The ChatGPT maker plans to update its business partners and investors through regular meetings instead of board representation. The development comes as regulators in the EU and US increase their scrutiny of Big Tech's investments in AI startups.</p>\n\n<p>Axios reports that on Tuesday, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, Keith Dolliver, sent a letter to OpenAI stating that the tech giant's board role was \"no longer necessary\" given the \"significant progress\" made by the newly formed board. Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/sam-altman-officially-back-as-openai-ceo-we-didnt-lose-a-single-employee/\">accepted a non-voting position on OpenAI's board</a> in November following the ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>\n<p>Last week, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/apple-to-get-openai-board-observer-role-as-part-of-ai-agreement?srnd=undefined\">reported</a> that Apple's Phil Schiller, who leads the App Store and Apple Events, might join OpenAI's board in an observer role as part of an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/apple-and-openai-currently-have-the-most-misunderstood-partnership-in-tech/\">AI deal</a>. However, the Financial Times now reports that Apple will not take up such a position, citingÂ a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036094#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036094&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8adccb20d5961c9ca8c01adacbe32075f60e2a5bff0454a0aab060ed11d16339","category":"Tech"}
