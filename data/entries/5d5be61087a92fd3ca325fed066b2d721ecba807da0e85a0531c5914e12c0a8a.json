It introduced a major new redesign, it was the first version of macOS to run on Apple's own in-house processors in addition to Intel's, and it was the first version of macOS in nearly 20 years to change the version number. Coming off that, this year's release was bound to feel a little small.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to Monterey, macOS version 12.0.</p>\n<p>Monterey feels of a piece with maintenance-mode macOS updates like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/09/os-x-10-11-el-capitan-the-ars-technica-review/\">El Capitan</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/macos-10-12-sierra-the-ars-technica-review/\">Sierra</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/macos-10-13-high-sierra-the-ars-technica-review/\">High Sierra</a>—change the default wallpaper, and in day-to-day use you can easily forget that you've upgraded from Big Sur at all. It's not that there aren't any new features here—it's just that improving any operating system as mature as macOS involves a lot of tinkering around the edges.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806212#p3\">Read 154 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806212&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d5be61087a92fd3ca325fed066b2d721ecba807da0e85a0531c5914e12c0a8a","category":"Tech"}
