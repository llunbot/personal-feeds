Gurman says that we can \"expect more from Apple in June.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman made the same comment about Prosser's mockups in his Power On discord channel. \"He either has very old screenshots or hasn't seen the real thing,\" wrote Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsser shared mockups that are supposedly based on the \"real deal version\" of ‌iOS 19‌ that he has seen, but the images feature a limited number of design changes. The Messages app mockup, for example, shows slight changes to the navigation buttons and a more rounded keyboard, while the Lock Screen has few changes beyond updates to translucency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsser said that apps, menus, settings, and more will have a more rounded aesthetic with glass-like styling modeled after visionOS, which we've also heard from Gurman and other sources.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his video, Prosser downplayed the changes and said that there are no signs of significant new additions beyond the minor design tweaks he demoed, but Gurman previously said that Apple's update will \"fundamentally change\" the look of the operating system, marking the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/\">biggest design refresh</a> to iOS since iOS 7.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has not provided specific details on the changes that Apple is planning to make, but he has said that Apple will update the style of icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons, with a look that is \"loosely based\" on the Vision Pro interface.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/gurman-ios-19-mockups-not-accurate/\">Gurman: Jon Prosser's iOS 19 Mockups 'Aren't Representative' of Redesign</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-jon-prossers-ios-19-mockups-arent-representative-of-redesign.2454062/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"04da8beaed1dc326500f154149a15fb75b5146507b33bf6c0078002fe940ebfd","category":"Apple"}
