According to the report, Apple is reviewing a launch timeframe for the device between 2026 and 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Apple is also actively developing an OLED iPad mini, so there remains uncertainty within Apple about the nature and specifications of the foldable. Speculation reportedly remains rife in the industry around whether it will be a foldable iPhone or foldable iPad model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung Display and LG Display have reportedly already been sending samples of 7-inch and 8-inch foldable panels to Apple since last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmong the panel companies, Samsung is said to be more active in developing Apple foldable panels than LG, and is the more likely primary supplier of a foldable panel if Apple decides on a 2026 release. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple, Samsung Display, and LG Display are also said to have \"different ideas\" about the ultra-thin glass material, foldable panel cover window, and the hinge concept, which is at the core of the product's mechanism. These differences reportedly involve contrasting judgements concerning product durability and reliability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce mass production is decided, Samsung is expected to create the foldable panel in the 6th generation A3 or A4 OLED line that it uses to make OLED panels for Apple's iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the report, Apple is also working on a larger 20.5-inch foldable product that is expected to be released later than the 7- to 8-inch device. The larger foldable has been rumored before by both <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/\">The Elec</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Bloomberg</a></em>, and Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/bigger-ipad-pro-could-be-foldable/\">Ross Young</a>.
