{"title":"Sketchy Rumor Claims iPhone 16 Pre-Orders Could Begin on a Thursday Instead of Usual Friday","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/iphone-16-pre-orders-thursday-rumor/","date":1724855421000,"content":"Apple's annual iPhone event is scheduled to take place <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/\">on Monday, September 9</a>. Typically, this would suggest that iPhone 16 pre-orders would begin on Friday, September 13, but <a href=\"https://www.macerkopf.de/2024/08/27/iphone-16-vorverkaufsstart-moeglicherweise-am-12-september/\">German blog <em>Macerkopf</em></a> this week claimed it heard that the pre-orders could instead begin on Thursday, September 12. The report did not elaborate on the source of this information, nor did it provide a reason for this potential change, so skepticism is warranted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg\" width=\"3532\" height=\"1986\" />\r<br />\nIt is worth noting that Apple's annual iPhone event most often takes place on a Tuesday, but the upcoming event on September 9 will be the first-ever iPhone event to be held on a Monday. It is unclear if the event being held one day earlier than expected has any relation to pre-orders potentially starting one day earlier as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, Apple will reveal when iPhone 16 pre-orders will actually begin during its event. Will it be a Thursday or a Friday?
