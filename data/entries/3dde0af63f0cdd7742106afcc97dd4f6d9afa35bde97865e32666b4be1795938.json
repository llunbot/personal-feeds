The remaining $200 million will continue funding DC fast chargers along designated highway corridors.</p>\n<p>The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, which administers the federal funding, called out a $15 million project to install chargers at 53 sites in Milwaukee and a $3.9 million project to install publicly accessible chargers on the Sioux Reservation in North Dakota as examples of the latest awards.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045600#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045600&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
