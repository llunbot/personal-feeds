{"title":"SD Card Slot in New MacBook Pros Supports UHS-II With Speeds Up to 250 MB/s [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-reader-speed/","date":1634821800000,"content":"Apple has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1450431284547833862?s=20\">confirmed to <em>The Verge</em>'s Dan Seifert</a> that the SD card slot built into the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models supports UHS-II, and while this could theoretically allow for read and write speeds of up to 312MB/s with USH-II SD cards, Apple has since confirmed that the reader supports up to 250MB/s of data transfer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-ports-hdmi-sd.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people had hoped that the SD card slot would support UHS-III with read and write speeds up to 624 MB/s, but this is not the case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers can take advantage of the SD card slot for additional storage space, with UHS-II-compliant SD cards <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=uhs-ii\">available in capacities such as 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB</a>. The return of the SD card slot will be particularly useful for professional users like photographers and video producers, allowing them to quickly transfer files without needing to use an adapter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe SD card slot is one of three ports that returned to the new MacBook Pro models after being removed in 2016, alongside an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macbook-pro-hdmi-2-0-port/\">HDMI 2.0 port</a> and MagSafe. The notebooks also have three Thunderbolt 4 ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/2021-macbook-pro-ports.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the expanded connectivity, key features of the new MacBook Pro models include Apple's next-generation M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, mini-LED displays with ProMotion for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, up to 10 hours longer battery life per charge, full-size physical function keys instead of a Touch Bar, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pro models have been available to order since Monday and will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, October 26. Pricing starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch model and at $2,499 for the 16-inch model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> The SD card slot on the new MacBook Pros supports up to 250MB/s of data transfer with UHS-II SD cards and up to 90MB/s with UHS-I SD cards, according to information shared by Apple after this story was published.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.
