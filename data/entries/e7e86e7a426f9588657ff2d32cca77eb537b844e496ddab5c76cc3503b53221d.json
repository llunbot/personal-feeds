This year, it takes place on Friday 24 November.</p>\n<p>It’s followed by Cyber Monday on 27 November, but over the last few years we’ve seen retailers start their deals weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>Fewer people will be wanting to hit the shops this year, so brands are likely to take advantage of this and share their best offers online rather than in-store.</p>\n<p>Whether bike lights are on your wishlist or you know a cycling enthusiast who needs some, you’ll find the best bike light Black Friday deals right here.</p>\n\n<h2>Are bike lights deals on Black Friday worth waiting for?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CatEye Sync Core front light for road cycling - beam shot\" title=\"cat eye\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’ll be shining a light on the best Black Friday cycling deals this week.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Last year, we saw huge reductions on bike light prices from brands including Light &amp; Motion, Guee, Exposure and Blackburn.</p>\n<p>There were big opportunities not only to save on single bike lights, but also on sets.
