[…]</p>\n\n<p>Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main\nwide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike\nAndroid phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then\n“pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is\nsticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since\n2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and\nfeatures 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve\nseen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an\nƒ/1.5 aperture.</p>\n\n<p>All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a\nmassive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with\nsome tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography,\nthe low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I came away super impressed with the low light performance of the 13 Pro, too.</p>\n\n<p>Bohn makes an important point in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review\">his corresponding review of the 13 and 13 Mini</a> too: because the camera bumps are all new sizes, cases for the iPhone 13 won’t fit the 13 Pro, nor vice-versa.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/21/bohn-iphone-13-pro\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"75b35f28d4f97d7b867cac6d725c97a74c3dc0a2587dbf5e55f14bb7b74c79ea","category":"Tech"}
