Apple is also working on smart glasses that include cameras, microphones, and integrated AI, much like the Ray-Bans from Meta. The glasses are also expected by 2027, according to Gurman. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is developing a new chip for the smart glasses, and it is said to be based on chips that are used in the Apple Watch, so there's likely to be AI feature crossover across the devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe cameras could be infrared sensors. In a June 2024 blog post, Apple supply chain analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said Apple planned to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/\">mass produce new AirPods with infrared cameras by 2026</a>. The infrared cameras could potentially enable \"in-air gesture control\" as well, allowing for device interaction with hand movements, according to Kuo. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven Kuo's 2026 mass production timeframe, we could potentially see the new AirPods with infrared cameras launch in 2026 or 2027.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/airpods-apple-watch-tiny-ai-cameras-in-2027/\">AirPods and Apple Watch Models to Get Tiny AI Cameras in 2027</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-and-apple-watch-models-to-get-tiny-ai-cameras-in-2027.2456907/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e61dea2732ad93bb98356f63d0589a368d7016696bdad68e7e407049b655d079","category":"Apple"}
