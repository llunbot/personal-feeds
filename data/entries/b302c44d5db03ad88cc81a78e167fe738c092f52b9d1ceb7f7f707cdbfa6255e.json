Sure, it’s still hot outside for most of our readers in the Northern Hemisphere at the moment. But #crossiscoming and so eventually will come cooler weather and shorter days. You may not be ready to give up riding outside just yet, but it still could be a good time to plan for late-season and off-season training…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wahoo KICKR price drops; indoor training is more affordable</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT-full-bike-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT-full-bike-.jpeg\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR BIKE SHIFT full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT-full-bike-.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT-full-bike--297x203.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT-full-bike--800x547.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT-full-bike--120x82.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT-full-bike--768x525.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, smart Wahoo KICKR trainers are still not cheap. But now we’re not talking about $200 off a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-kickr-rollr-update-virtual-riding-with-no-power-meter/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Rollr</a>, $300 off a sixth-generation <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/updated-wahoo-kickr-v6-indoor-cycle-trainer-kickr-bike-2-wifi/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr V6</a>, $300 off the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-drops-kickr-move-and-kickr-bike-shift-just-in-time-for-trainer-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Move</a>, $500 off the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-drops-kickr-move-and-kickr-bike-shift-just-in-time-for-trainer-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Bike Shift</a>, and $200 off the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-kickr-bike-trainer-copies-your-real-bike-for-perfect-fit-feel-smart-indoor-training/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickr Bike</a>. Those are solid savings if you were already on the fence about whether to upgrade your indoor training setup or not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while savings like this often would only come after new models are introduced, our super secret industry-insider rumors suggest that Wahoo does not have any big new indoor trainers launching for the rest of the year. So, these are still going to be the top of the KICKR line, at least through this coming winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>     Then, read the full savings Press Release breakdown below:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h4><em><strong>(London, Wednesday 4th September 2024) – </strong></em></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>As<strong> </strong>part of its ongoing commitment to increasing customer value for money, <strong>Wahoo Fitness</strong>, the leading fitness technology company for endurance athletes – announces a significant price reduction across its popular <strong>KICKR</strong> indoor training products.  In addition, Wahoo will also bring the <strong>KICKR CORE Zwift One</strong> and <strong>Zwift Cog &amp; Click</strong> to retail for the first time.
