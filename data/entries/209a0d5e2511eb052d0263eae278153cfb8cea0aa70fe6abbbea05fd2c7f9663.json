While they aren’t exactly “new”, it appears that Öhlins made notable updates across all models to improve their performance and make them the best versions yet. Let’s see what’s new.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Öhlins TTXAir Shocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX2Air-1.webp\"><img width=\"622\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX2Air-1.webp\" alt=\"Ohlins TTX2Air m.2 shock studio image\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX2Air-1.webp 622w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX2Air-1-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX2Air-1-80x120.webp 80w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1Air-m2-TM-3-1.webp\"><img width=\"597\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1Air-m2-TM-3-1.webp\" alt=\"Ohlins TTX1Air m.2 shock studio image\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1Air-m2-TM-3-1.webp 597w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1Air-m2-TM-3-1-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1Air-m2-TM-3-1-80x120.webp 80w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The TTX2Air m.2 (left) and the TTX1Air m.2 (right). (all photos/Öhlins)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Öhlins’ trail, enduro, and eMTB air shocks, the TTX1Air and TTX2Air, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ohlins-ttx-air-shocks-add-single-or-dual-air-options-for-more-trail-enduro-emtb-tuning/\">have been around for some time</a>. Both underwent internal and external overhauls and are adding m.2 to the model name to denote the latest version. The primary goal of the update was to reduce friction and enhance sensitivity to give these air-sprung shocks a more coil-like feel. This was achieved by using new seals and introducing a bladder system. Öhlins says, “Riders will experience increased comfort and improved rear-wheel control, thanks to the enhanced ground contact.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Öhlins claims the pedaling platform of the new TTXAir m.2 provides improved support when powering up difficult climbs. If that’s not enough, they also added compatibility with remote lockout systems. According to Öhlins, it is compatible with the Öhlins 3-Mode Remote, Scott TwinLoc, and Orbea Squidlock, as well as any remote that pulls 7.5 mm of cable per click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, Öhlins says air volume adjustment should be easier than ever thanks to a redesigned spacer system. Likewise, making adjustments to stroke length no longer involves removing the end-eye, which should make it more user-friendly and less time-consuming. Speaking of user-friendly, external updates include a redesigned adjustment knob that aims to make tuning easier and more intuitive. A redesigned end-eye should make it compatible with more frames, and refreshed graphics intend to give it a modern, but still very Öhlins, look. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2.webp\" alt=\"remote compatible switch on the TTX1Air m.2 shock.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Remote compatible switch on the TTX1Air m.2.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4.webp\" alt=\"new adjustment knob on the Ohlins TTX1Air m.2 shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TTX1airTM-4-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Redesigned adjustment knob for easier tuning.</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>TTXAir m.2 Details</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The TTX1Air m.2 has a single-can design that is best suited to linear linkage designs and more compact frames. The TTX2Air m.2 uses a double can design with positive and negative chambers and a larger air volume. Both versions of the TTXAir shocks retail for $745, although a 4% Tariff surcharge is being added in the US, bringing the total up to $774.80.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>TTX1Air – single-can design</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TTX2Air – double-can design</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TTX compression valve technology</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjustable HSC, LSC, and rebound damping</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TTX1Air m.2 is available in 165×45, 185×55, 190×45, and 210×55 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TTX1Air m.2 weight: 390 g (190×45 mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TTX2Air m.2 is available in 185×55, 205×65, 210×55, and 230×65 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TTX2Air m.2 weight: not listed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stroke length can be reduced by up to 7.5 mm in 2.5 mm increments</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Öhlins RXF38 and DH38</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38m3.webp\"><img width=\"624\" height=\"936\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38m3.webp\" alt=\"studio image of the Ohlins RXF39=8 m.2 fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38m3.webp 624w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38m3-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38m3-80x120.webp 80w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DH38m.2-34.webp\"><img width=\"604\" height=\"906\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DH38m.2-34.webp\" alt=\"Studio image if the Ohlins DH38 m.3 fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DH38m.2-34.webp 604w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DH38m.2-34-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DH38m.2-34-80x120.webp 80w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Mug shots of the new RXF38 m.3 (left) and the DH38 m.2 (right). </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ohlins-rxf38-air-sprung-single-crown-fork-packing-dh-internals-ready-for-aftermarket/\">single-crown RXF38</a> and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ohlins-dh38-m-1-enhances-control-w-updated-air-spring-damper-new-low-friction-fluid/\">dual-crown DH38</a> have put in a few years as the beefiest forks in the Öhlins lineup. While they come in different packages, both forks are built around Öhlins’ TTX18 damping cartridge and received similar internal and external updates. Öhlins TTX18 damping technology has already proven itself on the world stage as it was raced by the 2024 Overall World Cup Downhill Champion, Loic Bruni. That’s a strong foundation for both models, which clearly already worked well enough, for SuperBruni anyway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than complete overhauls, the internal updates to both the RFX38 and DH38 appear to be subtle refinements aimed at improving comfort, sensitivity, and bottom-out control. Öhlins added a bottom-out “spring booster” to add progressiveness, and they claim to have further optimized the system for use with volume spacers. This should make it easier for riders to avoid harsh bottom-outs and to dial in the ride feel through adjustments to air volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Externally, the stanchions have been given a slippery new surface treatment which Öhlins claims “improves small-bump sensitivity and overall ride smoothness,” and “reduces wear and enhances long-term performance.” The lowers have been updated with a shiny gloss black finish and similar bold new graphics to the TTXAir shock mentioned above. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14.webp\"><img width=\"907\" height=\"605\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the Ohlins RXF38 m.3 single crown enduro fork.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14.webp 907w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/RXF38-m3-14-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With 38 mm standchions and travel between 160 and 180 mm, the single-crown RXF38 m.3 is made for longer travel enduro bikes.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RXF38 m.3 Details</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The new RXF38 m.3 is Öhlins’ long-travel single-crown fork aimed at enduro, e-MTB, and aggressive trail riders.
