There’s a strip of this fabric up the outer side of each leg and extending over the hip, which is where you often experience most damage in a fall.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9951/altura-endurance-bibshorts-photos#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/altura_endurance_shorts_4.jpg?itok=yNPI89nX\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>7</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Fortunately, I never got to see how effective the fabric was, but even if you don’t have a spill, the anti-abrasion properties are handy if you’re riding off-road through brambles and past tree branches. It could potentially increase the longevity of your shorts.</p>\n<p>Other nice details include a mesh section with welded seams across the stomach area and on the front of the leg grippers. Inside these you get both a silicone strip and a deep array of silicone dots on the outer side and top of the leg, to make sure that the hems stay exactly where you’ve put them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.altura.co.uk/products/detail/AL31MENDBS/mens-endurance-bibshorts/?ng=146\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Altura Endurance bibshorts now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>All the seams in the lower body and legs are flatlocked too, a nice touch so that there’s minimal risk of chafing and irritation on a longer ride.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9951/altura-endurance-bibshorts-photos#6\"><p><span>Image 7 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/altura_endurance_shorts_7.jpg?itok=eOdzRAK8\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 7 of </span>7</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>As with many cycling shorts from a wide range of brands, the pad in the Altura Endurance bibshorts is from Italian company Elastic Interface.</p>\n<p>It’s not quite as thick or as dense as some, with the section under the sitbones being made of 70kg/m3 that's 11mm thick. If you like a thinner pad it’s fine, but higher priced bibshorts tend to have thicker, denser pads than this. Altura reckons the pad is good for rides of over eight hours though.</p>\n<p>Often brands try to make the straps on bibshorts as thin and airy as possible, but those on the Altura Endurance shorts are made of a double layer of stretchy fabric, again suggesting that they’re not engineered for the hottest conditions.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9696/joss-lowden-to-officially-attempt-hour-record-in-september\">Joss Lowden to officially attempt Hour Record in September</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/7339/filippo-ganna-sets-incredible-new-individual-pursuit-world-record\">Filippo Ganna sets incredible new individual pursuit World Record</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9999/ribble-ultra-road-launch-all-new-aero-bike-with-unique-bars\">Ribble Ultra Road launch: all-new aero bike with unique bars</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThey’re comfortable enough despite this, though, and ventilation at the back is better than most, as the straps continue as separate entities down to the main body, just linked up with a cross-strip at the top. Since this is an area that tends to get sweaty, the extra airflow is welcome and does increase comfort.</p>\n<p>Reflectives are fairly limited – particularly for Altura – with small grey reflective Altura lettering across the rear, a printed-on dark reflective strip on the rear of both legs and an Altura logo on the right leg.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.altura.co.uk/products/detail/AL31MENDBS/mens-endurance-bibshorts/?ng=146\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Altura Endurance bibshorts now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Strangely there are also reflective tabs just below the start of the bibs at the front, where no-one is likely to see them unless you’re riding at night with your jersey open – maybe something that Beaumont does when riding an extra-long leg in the tropics? </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9951/altura-endurance-bibshorts-photos\">Altura Endurance bibshorts photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>2 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9951%2Faltura-endurance-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Altura%20Endurance%20bibshorts%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9951%2Faltura-endurance-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Altura%20Endurance%20bibshorts%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9951%2Faltura-endurance-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Altura%20Endurance%20bibshorts%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9951%2Faltura-endurance-bibshorts-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9951/altura-endurance-bibshorts-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/altura_endurance_shorts_1.jpg?itok=7cqDI1He\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bibshorts\">Bibshorts</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1271ff7c939ba034fb2935c7194b83ff439ef10df3ff59e4e6aace486867c6d7","category":"Cycling"}
