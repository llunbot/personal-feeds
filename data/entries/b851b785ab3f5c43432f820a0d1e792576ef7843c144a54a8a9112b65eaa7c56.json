This <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmacbook-pro-13-3-laptop-apple-m2-chip-24gb-memory-1tb-ssd-silver%2F6382795.p%3FskuId%3D6382795&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2338711-1-0-0\">13-inch powerhouse with 1TB of storage and 24GB of RAM is $500 off</a>, available for $1,599 right now in what might be the best deal you’ll ever see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supercharged by the still-great M2 chip, this discounted <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmacbook-pro-13-3-laptop-apple-m2-chip-24gb-memory-1tb-ssd-silver%2F6382795.p%3FskuId%3D6382795&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2338711-1-0-0\">MacBook Pro</a> features an 8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU. Whether you want to use the laptop for work, play, or edit videos for your YouTube channel, you’ll be more than able to handle everything. And since it has a fan, it can reach longer sustained speeds versus the M2 MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 24GB of unified memory, multitasking is a breeze. Switch between a million Chrome tabs, video edit, play games, and listen to music like it’s nothing. You won’t even have to worry about the laptop overheating when you’re busy, because the MacBook Pro features a great active cooling system that will handle everything with ease. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can we also discuss that gorgeous screen? The 13.3-inch Liquid Retina display delivers crisp and clear images and fantastic colors, and since it has 500 nits of brightness, you can even use it out in bright light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, the coolest feature wasn’t even mentioned yet. Remember the Touch Bar? Well, this is one of the last few models to have one. When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/791082/13-inch-macbook-pro-m2-review.html\">reviewed this 13-inch MacBook Pro M2</a>, we enjoyed the Touch Bar, as well as the speed and graphics boost provided by the chip and the sustained performance vs the MacBook Air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, with a $500 discount and seeing how cool (and useful) the Touch Bar is, our advice is to hurry up and buy one before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmacbook-pro-13-3-laptop-apple-m2-chip-24gb-memory-1tb-ssd-silver%2F6382795.p%3FskuId%3D6382795&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2338711-7-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Save $500 on the M2 MacBook Pro with 24GB Memory and 1TB storage</a></p>\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b851b785ab3f5c43432f820a0d1e792576ef7843c144a54a8a9112b65eaa7c56","category":"Apple"}
