Perhaps you'd like a snazzy dead wolf spider to use as a biodegradable robotic gripper? How about a \"smart toilet\" that analyzes your urine stream and fecal deposits while taking a picture of your anus for good measure? These and other unusual research endeavors were honored tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2022 recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that time of year again, when the serious and the silly convergeâ€”for science.</p>\n<p>Established in 1991, the Ig Nobels are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/the-serious-science-of-the-ig-nobel-prizes-will-make-you-laugh-then-think/\">a good-natured parody</a> of the Nobel Prizes; they honor \"achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think.\" The unapologetically campy awards ceremony features miniature operas, scientific demos, and the 24/7 lectures whereby experts must explain their work twice: once in 24 seconds and the second in just seven words. Acceptance speeches are limited to 60 seconds. And as the motto implies, the research being honored might seem ridiculous at first glance, but that doesn't mean it's devoid of scientific merit.</p>\n<p>Viewers can tune in for the usual 24/7 lectures, as well as the premiere of a \"non-opera\" featuring various songs about water, in keeping with the evening's theme. In the weeks following the ceremony, the winners will also give free public talks, which will be posted on the Improbable Research website.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965450#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965450&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d4a83e19aae4f4d5cebf3685cacbd3dba43bab8fe7233d87bf062d827ed7a62","category":"Tech"}
