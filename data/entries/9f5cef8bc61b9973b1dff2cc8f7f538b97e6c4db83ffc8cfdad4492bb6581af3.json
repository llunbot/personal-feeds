With this latest 0.6 preview, Geekbench ML now supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. This means you’ll be able to see how machine learning-powered tasks run on your desktop, laptop, or even a server — whether it has new AI-specific hardware or not. And, as always, our models and data sets are identical across all supported platforms, making scores comparable.</blockquote>With new and improved frameworks, Geekbench ML supports faster performance on the latest hardware using more up-to-date models including for Core ML on iOS and macOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew workloads for Geekbench ML include Depth Estimation to reflect capabilities related to software-assisted portrait mode photo effects, Style Transfer to measure the ability to transform one image into the style of another one, and Image Super-Resolution to assess AI-driven image upscaling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/geekbench-ml-mac.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1041\" />\r<br />\nGeekbench ML 0.6 is still a preview release that Primate Labs will continue to tweak based on results and feedback, so scores from version 0.6 can't be directly compared to those from the previous 0.5 release.
