{"title":"Brave Browser Says Goodbye to Google As Default Search Engine, Replaces With 'Privacy-Preserving' Brave Search","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/brave-search-replacing-google-default-engine/","date":1634716225000,"content":"The increasingly popular privacy-focused browser Brave is officially saying goodbye to Google as its default search engine, replacing the world's most popular search engine in favor of \"Brave Search,\" the company announced in a <a href=\"https://brave.com/search-and-web-discovery/\">blog post</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/brave-search-beta.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBrave Search is Brave's answer to customers wanting a \"privacy-preserving\" search engine, and it's built using Brave's own \"independent index, and doesn't track users, their searches, or their clicks.\" Brave users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada will automatically have Brave Search set as their default search engine in the address bar instead of Google. Brave Search is also replacing other default browsers, such as Qwant in France and DuckDuckGo in Germany. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote> Today's Brave desktop browser update (version 1.31), as well as the Brave Android app (version 1.31)* and the Brave iOS app (version 1.32) all automatically offer Brave Search as the default for new users in these five countries, with fully localized versions in non-English geographies. Brave users can easily choose a different search option if they prefer by managing their search engine settings. Brave Search is also available in any other browser atÂ search.brave.com.</blockquote>Users in all countries will still be able to revert their default search engine back to Google or DuckDuckGo, but Brave is hoping the majority won't. Brave Search does not display any ads in its current form, but the company announced plans this week to change that. Brave says that the free version of its search engine will \"soon be ad-supported,\" with the company planning to offer a premium ad-free plan later down the line.
