The newest model gets a high-pivot placement, which means it should absorb bumps better. It’s more affordable than the Pivot though, costing $6,000 for the top-spec model.</p>\n<p>Arguably SRAM’s latest launch stole the limelight somewhat, with its brand-new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-rockshox-zipp-xplr/\">gravel-specific SRAM and RockShox XPLR range</a> that’s designed to make gravel riding faster and more fun. Be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rockshox-xplr/\">initial ride impressions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still in the world of gravel, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-bianchi-impulso-pro/\">Bianchi announced the Impulso Pro</a>. Although the new bike looks good, it left us asking whether it could do with a little more tyre clearance.</p>\n<p>We’ve also covered off a load of product reviews this week with brakes from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/formula-cura-disc-brake-review/\">Formula</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/shimano-bl-mt501-mt520-disc-brake-review/\">Shimano</a> and listed our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-mountain-bike-grips/\">best mountain bike grips</a>.</p>\n<p>There have been reviews of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/road-cycling-shorts/jersey-and-bib-shorts/velocio-womens-luxe-bib-short-review/\">Velocio’s Women’s LUXE bib shorts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/road-cycling-shorts/jersey-and-bib-shorts/dhb-moda-womens-classic-bib-shorts-review/\">dhb’s Modas</a> and <a href=\"http://bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-giant-tcr-advanced-2-review/\">Giant’s long-standing TCR</a> too. This time, it was the Advanced model, which is made from carbon and costs just a pinch under £2k.</p>\n<p>Finally, for those looking to relax and improve their flexibility, strength and mobility on the bike we’ve got <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/8-stretches-to-improve-your-flexibility-and-cycling-performance/\">eight yoga poses for cyclists</a>.</p>\n<h2>Topeak Ninja Master+ Cage SK with Topeak Ninja Master+ Toolbox T11</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Topeak-Ninja-Master-Cage-SK-and-Topeak-Toolbox-T11-with-Ninja-Master-Accessories-6-36dc54c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ninja Master Cage SK and Ninja Master Accessories Topeak Toolbox look like the ultimate on-bike storage solution.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Topeak-Ninja-Master-Cage-SK-and-Topeak-Toolbox-T11-with-Ninja-Master-Accessories-5-38eff10.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The tool box is rotated to the side to make accessing the tools easier.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nRemember when the best way to carry around a day’s worth of supplies for a ride was in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hydration-packs/\">hydration pack</a>?
