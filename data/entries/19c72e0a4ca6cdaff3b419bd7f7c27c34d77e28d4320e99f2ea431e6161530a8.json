Like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshibbett/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Ibbet</a> who I first rode with 9 years ago when I was <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hunt-38-carbon-wide-disc-wheels-one-ride-review-plus-updated-graphics/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced to Hunt wheels</a>, soon after he had won the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unsupported-racing-from-flanders-to-istanbul-3rd-annual-transcontinental-race-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Transcontinental</a>. Well now Hunt’s Beyond brand manager, Josh shared his green <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mason-iso-29-27-5-steel-bikepacking-bike-heads-off-road-in-search-of-adventure/\" target=\"_blank\">Mason InSearchOf</a> adventure bike for these close-up shots of the new wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heart of the Proven Dynamo wheels is of course the also-proven SON 28 front dynamo hub generator. It’s the benchmark dynamo for any modern disc brake wheel build. And it’s especially been developed for efficiency and high power output at slower MTB speeds. So you can count on plenty of light, even when you resort to hike-a-biking.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Hunt Proven Carbon XC Dynamo ultra-distance mountain bike racing wheels, 180 POE hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hunt-Proven-Carbon-XC-Dynamo-ultra-distance-mountain-bike-racing-wheels_photos-by-Maty-Podrouzek_Josh-Ibbet-Mason-InSearchOf_fast-180POE-hub-internals-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels are hand-built by Hunt, starting out with their standard Proven Race XC MTB rims, but with additional 3k weave carbon reinforcement around the spoke holes for even more durability.
