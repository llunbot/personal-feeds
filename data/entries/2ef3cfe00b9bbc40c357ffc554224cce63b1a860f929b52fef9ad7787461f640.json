LG's \"RDE\" OLED material set will apparently be used in the upcoming 11- and 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models, while a next-generation MacBook, slated to launch in 2027, will adopt LG's subsequent \"RDG\" OLED material set.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHistorically, LG Display's initial \"RD\" series material set was indiscriminately applied to both IT products and vehicles, but with \"RDE\" and subsequent sets, LG aims to demarcate its OLED materials, ensuring specialized applications for different industries. This means that future OLED Apple devices will have access to an OLED materials set that is tailored for its unique requirements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe OLED panels designed for upcoming ‌iPad Pro‌ and MacBook models features a two-stack tandem structure, which consists of two light-emitting layers stacked together. The two-stack OLED design can generate the same brightness levels as its single-stack counterparts, but with significantly reduced power consumption and extended lifespan. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> currently uses a single stack OLED display with one light-emitting layer.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg-display/\">LG Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/oled-ipad-and-macbook-specialized-materials/\">OLED iPad and MacBook Rumored to Feature Specialized Display Materials</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-ipad-and-macbook-rumored-to-feature-specialized-display-materials.2408513/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2ef3cfe00b9bbc40c357ffc554224cce63b1a860f929b52fef9ad7787461f640","category":"Apple"}
