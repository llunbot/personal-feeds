According to a new report from <em><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/COVID-slows-Apple-and-Google-production-shift-away-from-China\">Nikkei Asia</a></em>, Apple has had to begin mass producing the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ in China rather than Vietnam because of disruptions related to COVID-19 outbreaks.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple will start mass-producing its latest AirPods earphones in China instead of in Vietnam as previously planned, two people familiar with the situation said. The company still hopes to move around 20% of new AirPods production to Vietnam later, they said. </blockquote>Apple's plan to bring some MacBook and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> production to Vietnam has also been put on hold due to stricter border control measures in China and Vietnam, which has resulted in a lack of engineering resources and an incomplete supply chain, according to the report. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the problems is said to be the need for so-called \"new product introductions,\" where companies and suppliers work together to develop and produce a completely new product. This has been especially difficult in Vietnam due to the lack of engineers able to work on ‌AirPods‌ 3 and other new devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the height of U.S.-China trade tensions two years ago, Apple, Google, and Amazon all initiated moves to shift some production to Vietnam. Google had intended to produce the Pixel 5 range there early last year, but the smartphones ended up being made in China. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon is facing delays in the production of smart doorbells, security cameras, and smart speakers, as assembly lines in the northern part of the country coped with a surge in local COVID cases and tougher infection prevention measures.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to an IDC analyst quoted in the report, any setback for Vietnam is likely to be temporary, as the country has already established itself as a key alternative manufacturing location outside of China.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's forthcoming third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are expected to adopt a form factor similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌AirPods‌ were initially rumored to be launching in the first half of 2021, but in March, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <em>DigiTimes</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/airpods-3-production-rumor/\">said</a> that they're not expected until <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">later in the year</a>, with mass production to begin in the third quarter, which means the new version will likely launch in September alongside new iPhones.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vietnam/\">Vietnam</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/18/apple-airpods-3-mass-produced-china-not-vietnam/\">Apple Producing AirPods 3 in China Instead of Vietnam Due to Pandemic Disruption</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-producing-airpods-3-in-china-instead-of-vietnam-due-to-pandemic-disruption.2307906/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yh8GsIot2JI:OtBz1gINkFE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yh8GsIot2JI:OtBz1gINkFE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/yh8GsIot2JI\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"24236d78830a35fee9639c36bab513cbddf66b41d4aa27a5a9fc422df1f52644","category":"Apple"}
