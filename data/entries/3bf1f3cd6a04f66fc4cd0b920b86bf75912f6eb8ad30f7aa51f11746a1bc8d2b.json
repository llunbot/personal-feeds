But Marvel Studios just dropped a one-minute teaser for the film, which will kick off the MCU's Phase Six this summer.</p>\n<p>Marvel Comics' \"First Family\" hasn't been seen on the big screen since 2015's disastrous reboot of the moderately successful films from the 2000s. Per the official premise:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> introduces Marvel’s First Family—Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ben Grimm/The Thing as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner). And if Galactus’ plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren’t bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pedro Pascal plays Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic; Vanessa Kirby plays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman; Joseph Quinn plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch; and Ebon Moss-Bachrach plays Ben Grimm/The Thing. His Thing appearance is a combination of motion capture and CGI rather than heavy prosthetics, and director Matt Shakman consulted scientists and drew inspiration from desert rocks for the character's design. The cast also includes Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Natasha Lyonne, and Sarah Niles in as-yet-undisclosed roles, and the character of Mole Man is expected to appear.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/marvels-first-family-faces-galactus-in-fantastic-four-first-steps-teaser/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/marvels-first-family-faces-galactus-in-fantastic-four-first-steps-teaser/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3bf1f3cd6a04f66fc4cd0b920b86bf75912f6eb8ad30f7aa51f11746a1bc8d2b","category":"Tech"}
