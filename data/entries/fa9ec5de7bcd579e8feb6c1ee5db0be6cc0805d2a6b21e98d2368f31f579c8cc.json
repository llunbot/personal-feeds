If your application relies on ingesting customer data, you’ve probably built a CSV importer from scratch, and you probably didn’t like it. Flatfile is the turnkey solution.</p>\n\n<p>Flatfile, the data onboarding platform, makes sense of the jumbled data your users import, and transforms it into the format your app relies on. You can quickly deploy Flatfile into any environment and upgrade your customers’ data onboarding experience in minutes.</p>\n\n<p>No building a custom data importer. No complex import scripts. No need to build new features into an aging, in-house data importer. <a href=\"https://flatfile.com/product/portal/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=daring-fireball-sponsorship-display_q3-2021-portal-promotion-week-1&amp;utm_content=sponsored-ad&amp;utm_term=cta#get-started\">Get started today</a> if you’re ready to never build a CSV importer again.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/19/flatfile-portal\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fa9ec5de7bcd579e8feb6c1ee5db0be6cc0805d2a6b21e98d2368f31f579c8cc","category":"Tech"}
