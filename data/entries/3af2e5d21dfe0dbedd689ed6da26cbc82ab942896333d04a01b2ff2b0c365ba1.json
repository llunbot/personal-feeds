Worldwide, only 9 percent of plastic waste <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-produced-recycling-waste-ocean-trash-debris-environment\">actually gets recycled</a>. In the United States, the rate is now <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2022-05-plastic-recycled.html\">5 percent</a>. Most used plastic is landfilled, incinerated, or winds up drifting around the environment.</p>\n<p>Now, an alarming new <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772416623000803\">study</a> has found that even when plastic makes it to a recycling center, it can still end up splintering into smaller bits that contaminate the air and water. This pilot study focused on a single new facility where plastics are sorted, shredded, and melted down into pellets. Along the way, the plastic is washed several times, sloughing off microplastic particles—fragments smaller than 5 millimeters—into the plant’s wastewater.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937358#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937358&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3af2e5d21dfe0dbedd689ed6da26cbc82ab942896333d04a01b2ff2b0c365ba1","category":"Tech"}
