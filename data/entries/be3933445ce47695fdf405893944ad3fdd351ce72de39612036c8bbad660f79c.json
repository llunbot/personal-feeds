Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>SAVANNAH, Georgia—Hyundai's massive new Metaplant factory in Georgia is actually painted a subtle shade of green, not white, but you'd need someone to point that out to you. It's a shining example of the latest in car manufacturing—bright lights and white walls inside, knee-saving wooden floors on the production line, recaptured waste energy and solar—you name it. Hyundai even uses dog-like robots to check some welds. The vast facility is responsible for North American production of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/\">the electric Ioniq 5</a> and, now, the all-new Ioniq 9 SUV as well.</p>\n<p>That Hyundai would make a three-row SUV with its class-leading electric powertrain was a no-brainer. The E-GMP platform, with its 800 V powertrain, was designed for medium to large EVs, after all. In 2021 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/hyundai-hints-at-ioniq-7-with-its-latest-concept-ev-seven/\">it debuted the Seven concept</a>, which explored the idea of a living room on wheels. I'm not sure why the nameplate skipped a couple of digits, but the production Ioniq 9 tries to keep as true to that theme as possible within the confines of real life.</p>\n<p>Although they look quite different from one another, a common design language called \"parametric pixels\" ties together the Ioniq 9 with its smaller siblings the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Ioniq 5 SUV</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/the-2023-hyundai-ioniq-6-a-streamlined-look-equals-serious-range/\">Ioniq 6 sedan</a>. Creases catch the light even with the matte-gold paint of our test car, like the line ahead of the rear wheels that calls back to the collar on a traditional Korean garment. As ever, there are some other wonderful names for the design language: my favorite is \"aerosthetic lounge,\" but when you look at the images, also think of words like \"teutonic,\" \"boat tail,\" and \"integrated.\" When you hear the shape was inspired by a pebble, it makes sense that the drag coefficient is a slippery 0.27.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/2025-hyundai-ioniq-9-first-drive-efficient-for-a-big-one/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/2025-hyundai-ioniq-9-first-drive-efficient-for-a-big-one/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
