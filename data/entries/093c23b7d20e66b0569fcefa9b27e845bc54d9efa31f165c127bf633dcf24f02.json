{"title":"Due","link":"https://www.dueapp.com/","date":1735513200000,"content":"\n<p>My thanks to Junjie for sponsoring last week at DF to promote Due, their excellent reminder app for the Mac, iPhone, and iPad. I first linked to Due back in 2010, writing <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/22/due\">this short post</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve been trying this $3 app for a few days and digging it — a\nconvenient, low-friction way to set short-term reminders and\ntimers. Sort of like <a href=\"https://sabi.net/nriley/software/\">Pester</a> but for iPhone. Focused and\nthoughtful design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A lot of apps have come and gone since then. But Due has thrived. I never would have expected it when I penned the short blurb above, but here we are at the very end of 2024 and I’ve been relying upon Due for 14 years and counting. I started using it then and haven’t stopped. Due has long held a permanent position on my iPhone’s first home screen. And for several years now, Due has been available, with seamless iCloud syncing, on the Mac.</p>\n\n<p>You might ask why use Due instead of Apple Reminders. For me the answer is simple. Due’s conception and presentation of “reminders” works for me and my way of thinking in a way that Apple Reminders does not. I have tons of to-do items in Reminders. But for a certain type of recurring and one-off tasks that I want to be reminded about at a certain time, they go in Due.</p>\n\n<p>For example, our trash gets picked up on Monday and Thursday mornings. So I have recurring Due reminders to take out the trash every Sunday and Wednesday night. I don’t want these in my calendar. I just want them in Due, and Due makes sure I see notifications at 9:00pm every trash night. Due’s intuitive snoozing options make it easy to postpone one of these by a day during weeks when trash pickup is delayed by a holiday. I also keep my reminders related to Daring Fireball’s weekly sponsors in Due — posting the new sponsor’s ad at the start of the week, and writing my thank-you post at the end of the week — which reminders were quite meta this week.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out, that brief blurb I wrote about Due 14 years ago was meaningful to the success of Due. Reading <a href=\"https://www.dueapp.com/blog/three-sentence-review.html\">Junjie’s remembrance about that post</a> made me sit up a bit straighter, I’ll admit. I’ll accept some small measure of credit for discovering Due back then, but Due is so good, so distinctively original and useful, that I firmly believe its success was inevitable. <a href=\"https://www.dueapp.com/\">Go check it out</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/29/due\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"093c23b7d20e66b0569fcefa9b27e845bc54d9efa31f165c127bf633dcf24f02","category":"Tech"}
