The transition will apparently be relatively fast, mirroring the transition to the Lightning connector following its introduction in 2012.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"They're going to need to do a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> Duo with USB-C,\" Gurman said, and Apple \"certainly can update the ‌MagSafe‌ battery pack\" to add USB-C. It is not entirely clear if these refreshed accessories will be introduced at Apple's \"Wonderlust\" event on Tuesday, September 12.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also mused that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/apple-discontinues-apple-watch-dock/\">now-discontinued</a> Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Dock could be reintroduced with a USB-C port. Although Apple needs to refresh a large selection of its cables and accessories relatively quickly, he is \"not expecting any curveballs or any brand new types of accessories\" to be announced at the ‌iPhone 15‌ Apple event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, Gurman explained that a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> is in development, but it is likely not yet ready to be introduced. The next-generation battery pack involves a new concept that allows users to \"daisy-chain\" multiple battery packs together by stacking them and wirelessly charge multiple devices at the same time. For example, it will be possible to charge two iPhones at the same time, with one placed on either side of the battery pack. It will also, of course, feature a USB-C port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said that he does not think the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> with a USB-C port on the charging case, due to be announced next week, will be marketed as \"third-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌.\" The third-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ will be a more significant update launching next year or early 2025, Gurman claimed.
