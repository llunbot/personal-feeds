However, shock and absorption, width and surface texture are three things to bear in mind when considering which mountain bike grips to get.</p>\n<p>You might be happy with a relatively thin and firm grip if you’re riding cross-country, but you’ll likely want something with a bit more cushioning and a grippier surface if you’re heading downhill.</p>\n<p>Length of grip is another thing to consider. If you have large hands or run a wide handlebar, you might appreciate longer grips, but if space on your bar is limited you might want to go for a shorter grip.</p>\n<p>Most of the grips here are lock-on grips that have clamps. These are good because they stay in place and don’t move around, as other clamps can.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, read on to find out about the best grips our expert testers have got their hands on.</p>\n<h2>Best mountain bike grips in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Gusset S2 (Extra Soft Compound)</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Best mountain bike grips\" title=\"Best mountain bike grips\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The soft compound of these grips means they absorb impacts well, but it does wear down quickly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £18 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 131mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 32mm</li>\n</ul><p>Your hands drop neatly into place on the S2s, as the Extra Soft rubber sags a little under your weight.

The ‘traction ridges’ stop your hands slipping on flat landings. Plus, the super-soft rubber compound helps damp trail chatter and vibration when things get rough.</p>\n<p>The large twin lockrings won’t be to everyone’s taste, though. They sit taller than the rest of the grip and, if you’re used to hanging your hands off the end of the bar, you may find the outer ring a little intrusive under the meaty outer edge of your palm, especially on bigger impacts.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2>Also consider…</h2>\n<p>The following mountain bike grips scored fewer than four out of five stars when our reviewers tested them, but they might just tick the right boxes for you.</p>\n<h3>All Mountain Style Cero</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"All Mountain Style Cero mountain bike grips\" title=\"Best MTB Grips - All Mountain Style Cero\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The half-waffle pattern underneath adds extra purchase for your fingers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price: </strong>£27/$33/€30 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 132mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 30mm</li>\n</ul><p>All Mountain’s Style Cero grips use a comfortable rubber compound that aids in damping trail vibrations and adds mechanical grip when wearing gloves.</p>\n<p>A slight outboard flange helps keep your hands centred on the grips, while the half-waffle underside keeps your fingers in place.</p>\n<p>While the knurled pattern adds to the grip, it’s certainly not as effective as others we have tested.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Deity Knuckleduster</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Best mountain bike grips\" title=\"Best mountain bike grips\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Knuckledusters have a 32mm diameter, making them suitable for larger hands.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price: </strong>£19/$22/AU$40 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 132mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 32mm</li>\n</ul><p>The Knuckledusters are new-school grips that combine a single lockring with an internal conical sleeve, to give a solid hold on the bar while still allowing you to use its full width.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the waffle design on the underside, the upper mushroom pattern provides decent comfort.
