Which seemed like an intriguing but odd notion… until this month, when the same leaker revealed <em>why</em> this is slated to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple, Gurman claims in the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-04/apple-intelligence-early-preview-in-call-recording-safari-summaries-new-siri-lzfk2949\" target=\"_blank\">latest edition</a> of his Power On newsletter, is redesigning the SE in plastic as part of an effort to make the product “more kid-friendly.” Aside from potential impacts on cost and durability, the plastic material “could allow for a better array of colors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s an appealing prospect. In the past, Apple has occasionally used cheaper versions of its products as a testing ground for brighter, more vivid color palettes: notably the “unapologetically plastic” iPhone 5c, which came in emerald green, sapphire blue, coral red, and a glorious bright yellow, and the later and similarly vivid <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232091/iphone-xr-review.html\">iPhone XR</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this principle has never been applied to the Apple Watch, despite the presence of a budget-focused SE model since 2020. The SE comes in Midnight, Starlight, and silver, with no fun alternative finishes to choose from. Perhaps this is because the iPhones 5c and XR were felt to be unsuccessful (particularly the former), or perhaps Apple wanted to maintain the Apple Watch’s premium, classy image. Whatever the reason, it looks like the plan is about to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE was introduced in 2020 alongside the Series 6 as a lower-cost alternative starting at $279. Compared to that model, the SE was missing several sensors (ECG, blood-oxygen) and didn’t have newer features such as the always-on display and U1 ultra-wideband chip. It received a minor update in 2022 with a newer processor and a lower $249 starting price, and it still lacks many of the newer Apple Watch features, including a larger display, temperature sensor, and double-tap gesture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news and rumors as we get closer to the launch this fall, including the third-gen Apple Watch SE, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch 2024</a> superguide.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f7db985e964ea628d5fa85e90c99ee59958ed81ffa8c43580db0d85272b3cf4c","category":"Apple"}
