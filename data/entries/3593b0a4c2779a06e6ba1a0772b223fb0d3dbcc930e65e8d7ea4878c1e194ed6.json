Even if you’re only a few millimeters short. That’s why modern posts often brag about their low “stack,” which is the combined height of their saddle-clamp and wiper-seal hardware. But no matter how low the stack, it’s still possible that a 150 mm post will simply put you too high, even with it slammed flush against the seatpost clamp. Or maybe you just <i>can’t</i> slam your post because your frame’s seat tube has a bend or other interruption. These problems are especially common on medium and small frames, and arguably, it’s the medium and small riders who can benefit the most from getting the maximum amount of drop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-53.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-53.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-53.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-53.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-53.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Johns-Black-Cat-Project-Swami-Rigid-29er-64.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Thankfully, a few dropper brands have started integrating the ability to fine-tune a post’s total travel with spacers that prevent it from reaching full extension. Say you’d be 10 mm too high with a 150 mm post. With this feature, you can make your own custom 140 mm model. Much better than settling for 120. So, we put together a list of our favorite customizable travel dropper posts, outlining their pros and cons and listing all their dimensions so you can get a post that’s tailor-made for you.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-3.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-3.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75 150w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-3.jpg?resize=768,768&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"866\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-2.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-2.jpg?resize=768,665&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"866\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-1.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/custom-travel-dropper-post-1.jpg?resize=768,665&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<h3>Measure once, cut never</h3>\n<p>You may already know your extension length and your frame’s maximum insertion depth, but if not, that’s a good place to start the process of picking a dropper post. Extension length is simple enough. Just measure from the center of your saddle rails, along the seatpost, down to the top of the frame. As for insertion depth, it may be as simple as measuring the total length of the frame’s seat tube, but maybe not. Even on a traditionally shaped hardtail frame, there could be a water bottle mount blocking it halfway down, or the seat tube may bend or taper slightly. The best way is to insert a fixed post into the frame until it stops. That’s your maximum insertion depth. Aside from your post diameter, which should be printed on your current post, the only other thing you’ll need to check is that your frame is compatible with internally-routed droppers. We couldn’t find any externally-routed customizable-dropper posts. Now, armed with that knowledge, let’s dive into the options.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/04-oneup-v3-custom-length-dropper.png?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/04-oneup-v3-custom-length-dropper.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/04-oneup-v3-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/04-oneup-v3-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/04-oneup-v3-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.oneupcomponents.com/products/dropper-post-v3\" target=\"_blank\">OneUp V3</a></h3>\n<p>Anyone struggling to fit a long enough dropper post should start their search at OneUp. The British Columbia-based brand’s claim to fame has long been their industry-leading low stack and short insertion depth. But with the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/oneup-v3-dropper-post-review/\" target=\"_blank\">introduction of the V3 post early this year</a>, they’ve added industry-leading weight numbers, as well as noticeably smoother bushings and seals. OneUp also offers the widest range of lengths, from 90 to 240 mm. Travel is adjusted by inserting one or two sets of the included brass pins, dropping the travel by 10 or 20 mm. The adjustment can be done tool-free, though a strap wrench is recommended. It’s worth mentioning the previous generation V2, with impressive stats of its own, but the closeout pricing indicates the V3 will be taking over soon.</p>\n<h3>Dimensions:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1867\" height=\"920\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-13-at-3.08.09-PM.png?fit=1200,920&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-13-at-3.08.09-PM.png?w=1867&amp;quality=75 1867w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-13-at-3.08.09-PM.png?resize=1200,591&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-13-at-3.08.09-PM.png?resize=768,378&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-13-at-3.08.09-PM.png?resize=1536,757&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>10 mm or 20 mm travel reduction</li>\n<li>Available in 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 mm lengths (30.9 and 31.6 diameter)</li>\n<li>27.2 diameter: (90 and 120 mm lengths)</li>\n<li>34.9 diameter: (120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 mm lengths)</li>\n<li>Newly redesigned nitrogen-charged non-user-serviceable cartridge</li>\n<li>Without Remote: $269.99</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Class-leading low stack, depth, and weight</li>\n<li>Advanced, name-brand bushings and seals</li>\n<li>Improved bushing overlap in the longest posts</li>\n<li>Newly fortified anti-wobble components</li>\n<li>Nitrogen-charged return spring</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-adjustable air return spring</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/02-bike-yoke-revive-custom-length-dropper.png?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/02-bike-yoke-revive-custom-length-dropper.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/02-bike-yoke-revive-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/02-bike-yoke-revive-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/02-bike-yoke-revive-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://bikeyoke.com/en/revive/rev\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Yoke Revive 2.0</a></h3>\n<p>Bike Yoke got their start making aftermarket linkage components to augment the Specialized Stumpjumper. Well, from nerdy beginnings came a nerdy dropper post: The mechanism inside the Revive does not rely on an internal floating piston (IFP) to accommodate for the change in oil-chamber volume (check out our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/why-to-do-bicycle-suspension-service/\" target=\"_blank\">suspension-service story</a> to learn about IFPs). Instead, Bike Yoke uses a twin-tube system that mixes oil and air, which is more friction-free but can invite air bubbles into places they aren’t wanted. That’s where the Revive’s “Reset” function comes in. If the post ever feels spongy, you hold a toggle at the top of the post while compressing it to purge any unwanted air. This system allows for an incredibly light-action smooth-feeling dropper that happens to be 100% user serviceable. And of course, it’s travel-adjustable. You have to do some significant disassembly, though there are no special tools required. Adjustments can be made in five-millimeter increments, up to 20 mm. Bike Yoke’s posts are made in Germany, and the long-travel Revive takes the title of most expensive on this list, but their reputation speaks for itself.</p>\n<h3>Dimensions:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"841\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-125.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-125.jpg?w=841&amp;quality=75 841w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-125.jpg?resize=768,517&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"841\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-160.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-160.jpg?w=841&amp;quality=75 841w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-160.jpg?resize=768,517&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"841\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-185.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-185.jpg?w=841&amp;quality=75 841w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-185.jpg?resize=768,517&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"841\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-213.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-213.jpg?w=841&amp;quality=75 841w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-custom-dropper-post-213.jpg?resize=768,517&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>5 mm – 20 mm travel reduction</li>\n<li>Available in 125, 160, 185, and 213 mm lengths (30.9, 31.6, and 34.9 diameters)</li>\n<li>“Revive” function to manually bleed air bubbles</li>\n<li>Fully user serviceable cartridge</li>\n<li>Made in Germany</li>\n<li>Without remote: $350 (125 and 160 mm); $390 (185 mm); $440 (213 mm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Smooth, low-friction action</li>\n<li>Reset function allows for simple internals and smooth action</li>\n<li>Fully user serviceable, down to the hydraulic system</li>\n<li>Bushing and wiper service is no more complicated than cartridge-based posts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not cheap</li>\n<li>Travel adjust requires full disassembly</li>\n<li>Bike Yoke offers no customization at purchase</li>\n<li>No dedicated US Bike Yoke headquarters</li>\n<li>27.2 option limited to 80 mm travel</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/05-bike-yoke-divine-custom-length-dropper.png?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/05-bike-yoke-divine-custom-length-dropper.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/05-bike-yoke-divine-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/05-bike-yoke-divine-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/05-bike-yoke-divine-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://bikeyoke.com/en/divine/div\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Yoke Divine</a></h3>\n<p>Though the Revive is Bike Yoke’s flagship dropper, the Divine is not to be overlooked. It also features a fully user-serviceable twin-tube mechanism for the oil chamber, similar to the Revive. But instead of requiring an external toggle, the Divine’s air-bleed function happens automatically whenever the post is completely compressed. Bike Yoke claims this system isn’t quite as low-friction as what’s inside the Revive, but it still promises to make for easier oil flow and lighter, smoother action than a traditional IFP-equipped cartridge. The Revive offers more travel options than the Divine, which stops at 185 mm, but the Divine can be fine-tuned in the same way. It’s also slightly more affordable, which may be why some bike brands even spec the Divine as their OEM dropper.</p>\n<h3>Dimensions:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"841\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-125.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-125.jpg?w=841&amp;quality=75 841w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-125.jpg?resize=768,517&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"841\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-160.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-160.jpg?w=841&amp;quality=75 841w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-160.jpg?resize=768,517&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"841\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-185.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-185.jpg?w=841&amp;quality=75 841w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Bikeyoke-divine-custom-dropper-185.jpg?resize=768,517&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>5 mm – 20 mm travel reduction</li>\n<li>Available in 125, 160, and 185 mm (30.9 and 31.6)</li>\n<li>Self-bleeding system</li>\n<li>Fully user serviceable cartridge</li>\n<li>Made in Germany</li>\n<li>Without remote: $270 (125 and 160 mm); $300 (185 mm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of the smoothness advantages of the Revive, without the need for an external toggle</li>\n<li>Fully user serviceable, down to the hydraulic system</li>\n<li>Bushing and wiper service is no more complicated than cartridge-based posts</li>\n<li>More affordable than the Revive</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not cheap</li>\n<li>Travel adjust requires full disassembly</li>\n<li>Bike Yoke offers no customization at purchase</li>\n<li>No dedicated US Bike Yoke headquarters</li>\n<li>No 27.2 diameter option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/01-wolf-tooth-resolve-custom-length-dropper-post.png?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/01-wolf-tooth-resolve-custom-length-dropper-post.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/01-wolf-tooth-resolve-custom-length-dropper-post.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/01-wolf-tooth-resolve-custom-length-dropper-post.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/01-wolf-tooth-resolve-custom-length-dropper-post.png?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/resolve-dropper-post?variant=39704655527971&amp;currency=USD&amp;glCountry=US&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAzoeuBhDqARIsAMdH14HhmLzfaQv40fsmLGEkc1m5NLh8CsDaNSpSQjSvBPXTYxjEMNm7WikaApPqEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth Components Resolve</a></h3>\n<p>These Minnesota makers take a careful, deliberate approach to every product they put out, from drivetrain essentials to storage accessories. But perhaps the most impressive link in their drop-down menu is the Resolve dropper post. Over its year and a half on the market, the Resolve has proven to be one of the best-feeling, most reliable posts you can buy. That’s thanks, in part, due to its use of a twin-tube mechanism, similar to Bike Yoke, but only using a self-bleeding approach. And being from Minnesota, Wolf Tooth ensures the Resolve will still function in extreme cold, where many droppers will slow to a crawl. Also, its stack height is only bested by OneUp, and only by two millimeters. You can reduce the Resolve’s travel in five-millimeter increments, up to 50 mm. Wolf Tooth can ship your post with your chosen reducers pre-installed, which frankly, we recommend. Spacer installation is far from tool-free on the Resolve. But that gets us to one of its perks: Consistent with Wolf Tooth’s “right to repair” doctrine, you can rebuild the Resolve down to the last small part, while most droppers run on an impenetrable cartridge. You can get any individual piece of this post, straight from Wolf Tooth. A real bennie of buying a product that’s assembled in the US.</p>\n<h3>Dimensions:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"792\" height=\"612\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/wolf-tooth-resolve-dropper-custom-dimensions.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/wolf-tooth-resolve-dropper-custom-dimensions.jpg?w=792&amp;quality=75 792w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/wolf-tooth-resolve-dropper-custom-dimensions.jpg?resize=768,593&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>5 mm – 50 mm travel reduction</li>\n<li>Available in 125, 160, and 200 mm lengths (30.9 and 31.6 diameters)</li>\n<li>Assembled in Minnesota</li>\n<li>Without remote: $349.95 (125 mm) $364.95 (160 mm) $379.95 (200 mm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(Nearly) class-leading length and weight</li>\n<li>Fully user serviceable, down to the hydraulic system</li>\n<li>Custom travel lengths can be requested at purchase</li>\n<li>Every part is available individually (including lower tube if you ever need a different diameter)</li>\n<li>Smooth, consistent action thanks to advanced, self-bleeding internals.</li>\n<li>Bushing and wiper service is no more complicated than cartridge-based posts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not cheap, though not bad for US-made</li>\n<li>Travel adjustment requires special tools and full disassembly</li>\n<li>No 27.2 or 34.9 mm diameter option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/08-pnw-loam-custom-length-dropper-post.png?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/08-pnw-loam-custom-length-dropper-post.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/08-pnw-loam-custom-length-dropper-post.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/08-pnw-loam-custom-length-dropper-post.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/08-pnw-loam-custom-length-dropper-post.png?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/collections/shop-all-droppers/products/loam-dropper-post\" target=\"_blank\">PNW Loam</a></h3>\n<p>Running on a traditional sealed cartridge, PNW droppers are much more familiar than Wolf Tooth or Bike Yoke. They’re also much more affordable. Though there’s no real standout innovations to speak of, the PNW Loam dropper is a reliable aftermarket option for any cost-conscious buyer looking to step up (or step into) their dropper-post game. Plus, its cartridge features adjustable air pressure for fine-tuning of return speed, something the OneUp dropper abandoned in its V3 model. As for adjusting <i>travel,</i> PNW has the most user-friendly approach so far. There are no tools required, and not even any added parts. You simply remove the dust wiper and re-orient a stepped bushing that allows you to limit how far the post will extend. It can be done in five-millimeter increments, from five to 25 mm. The Loam also has the added perk of a rubberized collar that makes removal of the dust wiper easier, and can be swapped out to fit your bike’s color motif.</p>\n<h3>Dimensions:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1469\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/PNW-loam-dropper-custom-dimensions.png?fit=1200,613&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/PNW-loam-dropper-custom-dimensions.png?w=1469&amp;quality=75 1469w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/PNW-loam-dropper-custom-dimensions.png?resize=1200,501&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/PNW-loam-dropper-custom-dimensions.png?resize=768,320&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>5 – 25 mm travel reduction</li>\n<li>Available in 125, 150, 175 and 200 mm lengths (30.9, 31.6, and 34.9 diameters)</li>\n<li>Travel reduction requires no tools and no additional parts</li>\n<li>Non-user-serviceable internal cartridge with adjustable air spring</li>\n<li>$209 (without remote)</li>\n<li>$5 upcharge for colored options</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent balance of quality and affordability</li>\n<li>Easy travel adjustment</li>\n<li>Rare 200 mm option at this price point</li>\n<li>Adjustable cartridge air pressure</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No 27.2 option</li>\n<li>Few unique selling features aside from the impressive price</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1257\" height=\"838\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/07-pnw-rainier-custom-length-dropper.png?fit=1200,838&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/07-pnw-rainier-custom-length-dropper.png?w=1257&amp;quality=75 1257w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/07-pnw-rainier-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/07-pnw-rainier-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/collections/shop-all-droppers/products/rainier-dropper-post-gen-3\" target=\"_blank\">PNW Rainier Gen 3</a></h3>\n<p>In many ways, this is just a slightly more affordable version of PNW’s Loam dropper. <i>Very</i> slightly, in fact, but hey, twenty bucks is twenty bucks (or thirty if you’re shopping for a 125 mm post).

Its cartridge also doesn’t feature the adjustable air pressure that the Loam’s does, though the post does feature the same tool-free travel adjustment. One thing that the Rainier <i>does</i> have that the Loam doesn’t is a 27.2 option.

It’s not just that 9point8 was one of the first brands to offer a 200 mm post, or that they were one of the first to offer adjustable travel. What really sets the Fall Line apart is what makes it tick. While all the other posts on this list rely on oil flowing in and out of sealed chambers for them to move or stop, 9point8 posts rely on simple friction. Inside the upper tube, but fixed to the lower tube, is a fluid-filled flexible bladder that, when at rest, is forcing its outer walls against the upper tube’s inner walls. It’s like a rock climber working their way up a crack by inserting and twisting their forefeet. When you pull the remote lever, the bladder walls contract and allow the post to move. The advantage of this system is that it will almost never catastrophically fail on you. Something would have to go very wrong for that expanding mechanism to stop holding onto the upper tube. Even if you lose all air pressure, you can still move the post by hand and it’ll stay wherever you let go of the remote. Plus, you can lift your bike by the saddle with the post compressed without damaging it. The <i>disadvantage</i> is that it requires pretty regular disassembly, cleaning and regreasing to keep the compressions and returns running smooth and quick. After all, it’s a friction-based system. It doesn’t take long for friction to become a problem. Equally high-maintenance is the travel adjustment, which requires some special tools and fiddly disassembly. This is truly a tinkerer’s dropper post. Probably the longest-running model on this list, the Fall Line harkens back to an era when dropper posts were time bombs with short fuses, and inside them were black boxes you simply had to trust. If you’re not the trusting type, and you’re ok getting your hands dirty, the Fall Line may be for you.</p>\n<h3>Dimensions:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1970\" height=\"1484\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/9point8-fall-line-custom-dropper-dimensions.jpeg?fit=1200,1484&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/9point8-fall-line-custom-dropper-dimensions.jpeg?w=1970&amp;quality=75 1970w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/9point8-fall-line-custom-dropper-dimensions.jpeg?resize=1200,904&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/9point8-fall-line-custom-dropper-dimensions.jpeg?resize=768,579&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/9point8-fall-line-custom-dropper-dimensions.jpeg?resize=1536,1157&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>4 – 24 mm (or more) travel reduction</li>\n<li>Available in 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200 mm lengths (30.9 and 31.6 diameters)</li>\n<li>34.9 mm diameter: 125, 150, 175, 200 mm only</li>\n<li>25 mm rear-offset saddle clamp available at purchase</li>\n<li>Adjustable air return spring</li>\n<li>Without remote: $324 (75 – 150 mm) $344 (175 – 200 mm)</li>\n<li>Made in Canada</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Friction-based mechanism unlikely to ever fail</li>\n<li>Fully user serviceable</li>\n<li>Posts are made-to-order and individually tested</li>\n<li>Customization, including travel length, can be requested at purchase</li>\n<li>Adjustable air pressure</li>\n<li>Wide range of travel options</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>May develop slow or sticky action quickly</li>\n<li>Travel adjustment is time-consuming and requires special tools</li>\n<li>Complex disassembly prevents easy access for cleaning and greasing of bushings</li>\n<li>No 27.2 option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/06-9point8-fall-line-r-custom-length-dropper.png?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/06-9point8-fall-line-r-custom-length-dropper.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/06-9point8-fall-line-r-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/06-9point8-fall-line-r-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/06-9point8-fall-line-r-custom-length-dropper.png?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://9point8.ca/products/fall-line-r-dropper-seatpost\">9point8 Fall Line R</a></h3>\n<p>This is essentially the same as the original Fall Line, but in a lighter-weight package.
