Is it victories? Is it panache? Is it toughness? Is it technique? Are you born with it? Do you have to earn it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A true Flandrien is a person of steel, who never gives up and eats pain for breakfast. Now, thanks to Cycling in Flanders, you can prove yourself worthy of the crown by completing the Flandrien Challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scattered across Belgium’s cycling heartland are a great number of iconic and challenging bergs and cobbled sectors, hallowed names that over the years have shaped the outcome  of Classics such as the Tour of Flanders, Gent-Wevelgem and Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, yet all of them close enough to each other that they can be joined up into a couple of rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To complete the Flandrien Challenge you must complete 59 of Flanders’ most iconic segments in just 72 hours. Succeed and you will receive your own personalised stone on the wall of fame at the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen in Oudenaarde – the heart of the Tour of Flanders – and you’ll become a true Flandrien.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-scaled.webp\" alt=\"cyclist going up cobbled hill to a chapel\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-scaled.webp 1707w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cycling-in-Flanders-c-Pas-Normal-7-1140x1710.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All the climbs and cobbles in question have their own official Strava segments, so it’s easy to know where they start and finish, and easy to prove you’ve ticked them all off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to complete the Challenge in a single 303km ride if you really want to pay homage to the Flandrien spirit, however Cycling in Flanders has pre-prepared routes for doing it in two, three or four days, provided it’s less than 72 hours between starting your first ride and finishing your final one. The two-day route has a 212km ride and a 185km ride; the three-day has a shorter 74.8km alongside 190km and 142km rides; and the four-day route is mostly under 100km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever you settle on, completing it is a massive achievement worthy of the Flandrien crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling in Flanders</a>, you can win a two-night stay for you and a ride partner in Oudenaarde, plus entry to the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen, bike hire and a return on Eurotunnel LeShuttle if you’re driving.
