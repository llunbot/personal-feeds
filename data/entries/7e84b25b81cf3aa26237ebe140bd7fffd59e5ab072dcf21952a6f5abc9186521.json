Just ask the \"safety driver\" of an Uber self-driving vehicle, which hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2018. According to authorities, the driver was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/police-uber-driver-was-streaming-hulu-just-before-fatal-self-driving-car-crash/\">watching <em>The Voice</em> on Hulu</a> just before the crash—and was then charged with negligent homicide.</p>\n<p>These kinds of cases are always tragic because they feel so easily avoidable, but they also happen with enough regularity that it's easy to tune them out. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving\">3,308 people were killed by distracted drivers in 2022 alone</a>—and \"texting is the most alarming distraction.\"</p>\n<p>That's why states continue to crack down on cell phone use while driving. A <a href=\"https://www.codot.gov/news/2024/october/new-2025-law-bans-holding-phones-while-driving\">Colorado law</a> that went into effect on January 1, for instance, bans a driver from using any mobile electronic device unless it is hands-free. Thirty US states now have such bans in place.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/girl-strangled-by-her-own-wheelchair-as-bus-monitor-sent-34-texts-checked-instagram/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/girl-strangled-by-her-own-wheelchair-as-bus-monitor-sent-34-texts-checked-instagram/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e84b25b81cf3aa26237ebe140bd7fffd59e5ab072dcf21952a6f5abc9186521","category":"Tech"}
