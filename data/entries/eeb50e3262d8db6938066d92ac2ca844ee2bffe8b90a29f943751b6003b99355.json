The state agency also urged AT&amp;T to upgrade copper facilities to fiber instead of trying to shut down the outdated portions of its network.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T asked the state to eliminate its Carrier of Last Resort (COLR) obligation, which requires it to provide landline telephone service to any potential customer in its service territory. A CPUC administrative law judge <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/california-rebuffs-att-says-it-must-keep-offering-landline-phone-service/\">recommended rejection</a> of the application last month, and the commission voted to dismiss AT&amp;T's application <a href=\"https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M533/K846/533846154.PDF\">with prejudice</a> on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\"Our vote to dismiss AT&amp;T's application made clear that we will protect customer access to basic telephone service... Our rules were designed to provide that assurance, and AT&amp;T's application did not follow our rules,\" Commissioner John Reynolds said in a <a href=\"https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M534/K132/534132863.PDF\">CPUC announcement</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032816#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032816&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eeb50e3262d8db6938066d92ac2ca844ee2bffe8b90a29f943751b6003b99355","category":"Tech"}
