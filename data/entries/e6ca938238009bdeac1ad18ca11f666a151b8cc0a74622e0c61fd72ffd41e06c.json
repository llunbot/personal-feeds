Fiscus wrote that, as the now-former medical director for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization programs at the Tennessee Department of Health, she is the 25th immunization director to leave their position amid the pandemic. With only 64 territorial immunization directors in the country, her firing brings the nationwide turnover in immunization directors to nearly 40 percent during the health crisis.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779998#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779998&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e6ca938238009bdeac1ad18ca11f666a151b8cc0a74622e0c61fd72ffd41e06c","category":"Tech"}
