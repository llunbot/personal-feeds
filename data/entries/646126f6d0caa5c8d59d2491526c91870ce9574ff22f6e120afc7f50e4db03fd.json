Great Britain’s Kye Whyte claimed the silver medal ahead of Colombia’s Carlos Alberto Ramirez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I can hardly believe it,” Kimmann told NOS TV. “I hit the official on Monday and thought the dream is over. I knew I am young and the track suits me. If I ever become Olympic champ it’s now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“After the training I took painkillers but then my stomach hurt. The delay helped me. I had to black out all the fuzz around me. I was so tired after the past days that I thought someone would pass me every time. I don’t believe it yet. I fought and it’s gold. Now I am going to phone my parents.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRykPAkBT4Q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRykPAkBT4Q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Niek Kimmann (@niekkimmann)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p><em>Kimmann’s training crash on Monday.</em></p>\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n<p>A notable omission from the final was reigning Olympic champion Connor Fields (USA) who crashed heavily in heat 3 of the semifinals and was rushed to hospital. The final heat of the women’s semifinal was also crash-marred with Australia’s Saya Sakakibara falling heavily and also needing medical attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great Britain’s Bethany Shriever went on to win gold in the women’s final, ahead of two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajón (Colombia), and Merel Smulders (Netherlands).</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/days-after-breaking-his-knee-in-a-collision-dutch-rider-takes-bmx-gold/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"646126f6d0caa5c8d59d2491526c91870ce9574ff22f6e120afc7f50e4db03fd","category":"Cycling"}
