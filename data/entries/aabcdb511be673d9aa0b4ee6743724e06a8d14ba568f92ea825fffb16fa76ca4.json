This is something we've heard before for this device, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-esim-only-in-more-countries-report/\">entire iPhone 17 lineup could be eSIM-only in more countries</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the 5.5mm measurement ends up being accurate, the \"iPhone 17 Air\" would become the thinnest iPhone ever, topping the current 6.9mm record set by the iPhone 6. It also means the device would be around 30% thinner than the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, and around 33% thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device measuring 5.5mm only at its \"thinnest point\" likely means it will have an ultra-thin chassis with a thicker rear camera bump. The device is expected to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">only a single 48-megapixel rear camera</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been conflicting rumors about the device's exact thinness, but several sources have agreed on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/\">around a 5mm</a> to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/\">mid-6mm range</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest 13-inch iPad Pro model measures <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/\">just 5.1mm thick</a>, so the \"iPhone 17 Air\" could be approaching that impressive territory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said the ultra-thin iPhone 17 model will enter mass production in the second half of 2025. The device is expected to launch in September alongside the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. There is no iPhone 17 Plus expected, with the \"iPhone 17 Air\" effectively set to become a replacement for the Plus model in this year's lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDue to its thin design, the \"iPhone 17 Air\" is expected to have some reduced specifications compared to the Pro models. In addition to the single rear camera, the device is rumored to have a standard A19 chip instead of the A19 Pro chip, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/\">only a single speaker</a>. However, Kuo believes Apple will still charge a \"high price\" for the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther rumored \"iPhone 17 Air\" specifications include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">a 6.6-inch display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">Apple-designed 5G modem</a>, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">New 'iPhone 17 Air' Rumors: Ultra-Thin 5.5mm Design, No SIM Card Slot</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-17-air-rumors-ultra-thin-5-5mm-design-no-sim-card-slot.2447140/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aabcdb511be673d9aa0b4ee6743724e06a8d14ba568f92ea825fffb16fa76ca4","category":"Apple"}
