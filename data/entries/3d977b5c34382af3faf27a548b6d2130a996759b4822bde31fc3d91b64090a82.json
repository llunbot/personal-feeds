Our goal is to understand how well users actually perceive the content that we present to them.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not only about finding pain points and things that cause confusion or hinder users from finding the right answer on a page but also about if our content <strong>clearly and precisely articulates</strong> what we actually want to communicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is <strong>part of our ongoing series</strong> on <a href=\"/category/ux\">UX</a>. You can find more details on <strong>design patterns and UX strategy</strong> in <a href=\"https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/\">Smart Interface Design Patterns</a> 🍣 — with live UX training coming up soon. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhZ3el3n-u0\">Free preview</a>.</p>\n\nBanana Testing\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/how-to-test-and-measure-content-in-ux/banana-testing-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>A great way to test how well your design matches a user’s <strong>mental model</strong> is Banana Testing. We replace all key actions with the word “Banana,” then ask users to suggest what each action could prompt.</p>\n\n<p>Not only does it tell you if key actions are <strong>understood immediately</strong> and if they are in the right place but also if your icons are helpful and if interactive elements such as links or buttons are perceived as such.</p>\n\nContent Heatmapping\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/how-to-test-and-measure-content-in-ux/heatmapping-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>One reliable technique to assess content is <a href=\"https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/02/a-simple-technique-for-evaluating-content/\">content heatmapping</a>. The way we would use it is by giving participants a task, then asking them to <strong>highlight things that are clear or confusing</strong>. We could define any other dimensions or style lenses as well: e.g., phrases that bring more confidence and less confidence.</p>\n\n<p>Then we map all highlights into a <strong>heatmap</strong> to identify patterns and trends. You could run it with print-outs in person, but it could also happen in Figjam or in Miro remotely — as long as your tool of choice has a highlighter feature.</p>\n\nRun Moderated Testing Sessions\n\n<p>These little techniques above help you discover content issues, but they <strong>don’t tell you what is missing</strong> in the content and what doubts, concerns, and issues users have with it. For that, we need to uncover user needs in more detail.</p>\n\n<p>Too often, users say that a page is “<strong>clear and well-organized</strong>,” but when you ask them specific questions, you notice that their understanding is vastly different from what you were trying to bring into spotlight.</p>\n\n<p>Such insights rarely surface in unmoderated sessions — it’s much more effective to <strong>observe behavior</strong> and ask questions on the spot, be it in person or remote.</p>\n\nTest Concepts, Not Words\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/how-to-test-and-measure-content-in-ux/concept-testing-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Before testing, we need to know what we want to learn. First, write up a plan with goals, customers, questions, script. Don’t tweak words alone — broader is better. In the session, avoid speaking aloud as it’s usually not how people consume content. <strong>Ask questions and wait silently</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>After the task is completed, ask users to explain the product, flow, and concepts to you. But: don’t ask them what they like, prefer, feel, or think. And whenever possible, <strong>avoid the word “content”</strong> in testing as users often perceive it differently.</p>\n\nChoosing The Right Way To Test\n\n<p>There are plenty of different tests that you could use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Banana test</strong> 🍌<br />Replace key actions with “bananas,” ask to explain.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloze test</strong> 🕳️<br />Remove words from your copy, ask users to fill in the blanks.</li>\n<li><strong>Reaction cards</strong> 🤔<br />Write up emotions on 25 cards, ask users to choose.</li>\n<li><strong>Card sorting</strong> 🃏<br />Ask users to group topics into meaningful categories.</li>\n<li><strong>Highlighting</strong> 🖍️<br />Ask users to highlight helpful or confusing words.</li>\n<li><strong>Competitive testing</strong> 🥊<br />Ask users to explain competitors’ pages.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When choosing the right way to test, consider the following guidelines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do users understand?</strong><br />Interviews, highlighting, Cloze test</li>\n<li><strong>Do we match the mental model?</strong><br />Banana testing, Cloze test</li>\n<li><strong>What word works best?</strong><br />Card sorting, A/B testing, tree testing</li>\n<li><strong>Why doesn’t it work?</strong><br />Interviews, highlighting, walkthroughs</li>\n<li><strong>Do we know user needs?</strong><br />Competitive testing, process mapping</li>\n</ul>\n\nWrapping Up\n\n<p>In many tasks, there is rarely anything more impactful than the careful selection of words on a page. However, it’s not only the words alone that are being used but the <strong>voice and tone</strong> that you choose to communicate with customers.</p>\n\n<p>Use the techniques above to test and measure how well people perceive content but also check how they perceive the <strong>end-to-end experience</strong> on the site.</p>\n\n<p>Quite often, the right words used incorrectly on a key page can convey a wrong message or provide a suboptimal experience. Even though the rest of the product might perform remarkably well, <strong>if a user is blocked</strong> on a critical page, they will be gone before you even blink.</p>\n\nUseful Resources\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://contentdesign.intuit.com/foundations/content-testing/\">Practical Guide To Content Testing</a>, by Intuit</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/testing-content-websites/\">How To Test Content With Users</a>, by Kate Moran</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@jsaito/5-fun-ways-to-test-words-f132af5a8456\">Five Fun Ways To Test Words</a>, by John Saito</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/02/a-simple-technique-for-evaluating-content/\">A Simple Technique For Evaluating Content</a>, by Pete Gale</li>\n</ul>\n\nNew: How To Measure UX And Design Impact\n\n<p>Meet Measure UX &amp; Design Impact (8h), a new practical guide for designers and UX leads to measure and show your UX impact on business.
