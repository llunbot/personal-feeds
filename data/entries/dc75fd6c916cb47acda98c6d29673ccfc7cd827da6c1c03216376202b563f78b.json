Give it a watch below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYesterday, we reported that the new Mac mini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-modular-storage/\">features modular storage</a>, and YouTube channel dosdude1 has already opened up the base model and upgraded its storage capacity from 256GB to 1TB. The steps included removing the original NAND storage chips from the board with a heat gun, preparing the new NAND chips by reballing them, soldering the new NAND chips to the board, and restoring the Mac mini in DFU Mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile those steps are impractical for the average customer, the video proves that storage in the new Mac mini can technically be upgraded without having to pay for Apple's overpriced storage upgrade options when ordering the computer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/\">Teardown</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/09/more-teardown-and-storage-upgrade/\">New Mac Mini Videos: Best Teardown Yet and First DIY Storage Upgrade</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-mini-videos-best-teardown-yet-and-first-diy-storage-upgrade.2442447/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dc75fd6c916cb47acda98c6d29673ccfc7cd827da6c1c03216376202b563f78b","category":"Apple"}
