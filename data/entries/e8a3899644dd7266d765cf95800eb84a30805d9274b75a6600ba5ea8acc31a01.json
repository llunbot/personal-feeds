Gurman says he expects Apple to agree a deal with Google and Anthropic to offer their AI services through its devices, with the former expected to be announced when Apple Intelligence launches in the fall as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> previously reported that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-ai-privacy-concerns/\">turned down</a> an AI partnership with Facebook parent company Meta due to privacy concerns. Meanwhile, Apple is said to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-ai-partner-china/\">seeking partnerships for the Chinese market</a>, where ChatGPT and other similar AI services are not available. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/apple-intelligence-features-likely-paid-sub/\">Some Apple Intelligence Features Likely to Require Paid Subscription</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-apple-intelligence-features-likely-to-require-paid-subscription.2430439/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e8a3899644dd7266d765cf95800eb84a30805d9274b75a6600ba5ea8acc31a01","category":"Apple"}
