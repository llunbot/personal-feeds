SharePlay is designed to let users call their friends and family and interact by watching movies, watching TV, or listening to music together.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has added features like shared playlists and TV show syncing so everyone sees the same thing at the same time. SharePlay also has a built-in screen sharing feature, and Apple is still working out the bugs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPaired with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> 15.1 beta (which is invite only), iOS 15.1 adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, bringing Apple's speakers in line with iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌iPhone‌ users who have a health care provider or state record that uses SMART Health Cards can import their COVID-19 vaccination records into the Health app and can then add a vaccine card to the Wallet app. This is an opt-in feature that uses a global specification, but healthcare providers need to implement it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Smart Health Cards are or will be available to those in California, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties, as well those who were vaccinated at Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. Healthcare providers like electronic health record vendors like Epic and Cerner also support Smart Health Cards.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe update fixes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/ios-15-1-beta-2-unlock-with-apple-watch-fixed/\">an Unlock with Apple Watch bug</a> that prevented an authenticated Apple Watch from unlocking an ‌iPhone‌ when the user is wearing a mask. The feature was unable to be toggled on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a>, but after the iOS 15.1 update, it is once again functional.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/apple-seeds-ios-15-1-beta-3-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS and iPadOS 15.1 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-betas-of-ios-and-ipados-15-1-to-developers.2315686/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=i9zgbKc-dAM:SCcgfrdyLqM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=i9zgbKc-dAM:SCcgfrdyLqM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/i9zgbKc-dAM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7a04eec85fe9af6f4b43bcb37f1f80e4e3486e5cea17d360772fa7a4a17b9df","category":"Apple"}
