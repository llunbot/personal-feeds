The stolen records, which AT&amp;T says were “downloaded illegally from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform,” include every call and text record for every AT&amp;T cellular customer from May 1, 2022 to October 31, 2022 as well as a small subset of customers from January 2, 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company was clear that the <em>content</em> of calls and texts was not exposed. But the hackers have a record of every call or text made or received along with counts and call durations for some calls during those specific months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this affects more than just AT&amp;T customers—anyone who called or texted an AT&amp;T number (including landline service) during this time would show up as part of these records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer names and other personal information is not part of the data, but it is often not difficult to associate a name with a phone number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company says it has secured the access point and will contact all affected customers.
