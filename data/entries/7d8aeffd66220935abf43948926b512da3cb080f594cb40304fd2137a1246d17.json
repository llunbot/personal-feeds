Peeking over his shoulder, Petor was clicking a device in one hand and holding a blue and red rear derailleur in the other.</p>\n<p>The Ukraine-based manufacturer has been working on completing an entire drivetrain kit with a mountain bike and road bike shifter for its all-new CNC’d in house electronic derailleur. The finish is pristine and in the same class Garbaruk is known for, even on this prototype product, which was displayed on a bike we’ll showcase tomorrow.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Antidote-Pathseeker-Full-Suspension-Gravel-Bike-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Antidote-Pathseeker-Full-Suspension-Gravel-Bike-30.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Antidote-Pathseeker-Full-Suspension-Gravel-Bike-30.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Antidote-Pathseeker-Full-Suspension-Gravel-Bike-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Garbaruk-MTB-Shifter-and-Derailleur-2-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Garbaruk-MTB-Shifter-and-Derailleur-2-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Garbaruk-MTB-Shifter-and-Derailleur-2-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Garbaruk-MTB-Shifter-and-Derailleur-2-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>They are using their own BlueTooth-actuated servos with a proprietary battery interface. The shifter feels solid and actuates easily, while tucking on a 22.2 bar clamp right next to your brake levers. What’s nice about the system is the “click” of the shifter, which makes a pleasant sound and feels like an indexed shift. </p>\n<p>Garbaruk is working to bring the new MTB and road shifter along with the rear derailleur to market by the end of the year. The road shifter will be a button that fits into the side of a TRP brake lever. It will be available in all of the brand’s anodizing colors, which is also does in-house. What was perhaps the most impressive was the unit’s weight. It felt much lighter in hand than other market options. </p>\n<p>Pricing is to be determined but as with <a href=\"https://www.garbaruk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Garbaruk</a>‘s other products, it will be well worth the expense. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/garbaruk-prototype-electronic-rear-derailleur-shifter/\">Garbaruk Displays Prototype Electronic Rear Derailleur and Shifter at Bespoked UK</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7d8aeffd66220935abf43948926b512da3cb080f594cb40304fd2137a1246d17","category":"Cycling"}
