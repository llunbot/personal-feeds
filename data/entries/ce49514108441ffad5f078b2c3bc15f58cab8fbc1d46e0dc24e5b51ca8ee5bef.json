We hope the list sparks debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is a subjective list, although hard metrics such as total launches, tonnage to orbit, success rate, and more were all important factors in the decision. And our focus remains on what each company accomplished in 2023, not on what they might do in the future. Certainly there will be more reshuffling next year.</p>\n<h2>1. SpaceX (no change)</h2>\n<p>Only one rocket company approached a mind-boggling 100 launches this year. Only one company reused more than 90 percent of the rockets it launched in 2023. Only one company launched one million kilograms of cargo into orbit. And only one company debuted the (privately developed) largest and most powerful rocket ever seenâ€”Starship. And then launched it again just months later on a mostly successful flight.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991377#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991377&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce49514108441ffad5f078b2c3bc15f58cab8fbc1d46e0dc24e5b51ca8ee5bef","category":"Tech"}
