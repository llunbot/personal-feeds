{"title":"U.S. Treasury: All Silicon Valley Bank Depositors Will Have Access to All of Their Money Starting Tomorrow","link":"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1337","date":1678668682000,"content":"\n<p>The Department of the Treasury:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The following statement was released by Secretary of the Treasury\nJanet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and\nFDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg:</p>\n\n<p>Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy\nby strengthening public confidence in our banking system. This\nstep will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform\nits vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to\ncredit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes\nstrong and sustainable economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and\nthe Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary\nYellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its\nresolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a\nmanner that fully protects all depositors. Depositors will have\naccess to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses\nassociated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be\nborne by the taxpayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Taxpayers aren’t on the hook because SVB has assets greater than its deposits — they simply don’t have <em>liquid</em> assets to cover them. Sanity prevails. They say there are no atheists in a foxhole, but there are more of them than there are libertarians in a bank run.
