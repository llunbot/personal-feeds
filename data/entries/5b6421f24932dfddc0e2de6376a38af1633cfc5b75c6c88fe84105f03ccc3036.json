In a research note with Haitong International Securities on Tuesday, he said the modem will be manufactured by Apple's chipmaking partner TSMC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-iPhone-SE-4-5G-Modem-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThis information comes two months after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/kuo-iphone-se-4-oled-display/\">restarted development of a fourth-generation iPhone SE</a> with a 6.1-inch OLED display and an Apple-designed 5G modem. He said the modem would be built with TSMC's 4nm process and support sub-6GHz bands only, meaning that mmWave would not be supported initially.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said mass production of the fourth-generation iPhone SE would begin in the first half of 2024, and Qualcomm's CEO also anticipated a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/qualcomm-ceo-apple-5g-chip-2024/\">2024 timeframe for Apple's modem</a>, but Pu believes the device's launch has been delayed until 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current iPhone SE was released in March 2022 and is equipped with Qualcomm's custom Snapdragon X57 chip for sub-6GHz 5G. The 4.7-inch device is Apple's last iPhone with a Home button and Touch ID, but Face ID is likely for the new model, as Kuo said the device will have a similar design as the standard iPhone 14 model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple acquired the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/\">majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019 in an effort to design its own iPhone modem, a move that would reduce its dependance on Qualcomm. It's unclear if Apple's modem will offer any customer-facing benefits compared to Qualcomm's modems, such as faster 5G performance or improved power efficiency.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-se-5g-modem-2025-launch-rumor/\">New iPhone SE With Apple-Designed 5G Modem Said to Launch in 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-se-with-apple-designed-5g-modem-said-to-launch-in-2025.2386633/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5b6421f24932dfddc0e2de6376a38af1633cfc5b75c6c88fe84105f03ccc3036","category":"Apple"}
