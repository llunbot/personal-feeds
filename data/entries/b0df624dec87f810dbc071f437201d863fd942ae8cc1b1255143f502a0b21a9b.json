With iOS 18.1, 18.2, and 18.3, users have seen a host of tweaks and changes designed to enhance everything from the Mail app to Camera Control on the iPhone 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/50-New-iPhone-Features-Apple-Added-Since-iOS-18-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /> \r<br />\nBelow, we've listed 50 of the features and changes that have been rolled out through these recent updates. Keep reading to see if you picked up on them all. You can make sure your iPhone is running the latest iOS 18.3 update by going to Settings ➝ General ➝ Software Update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Reset Your Control Center</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/reset-control-center.jpg\" alt=\"control center\" width=\"4377\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\nWith iOS 18, Apple made the Control Center thoroughly customizable, but there's no way to roll back your changes if things get messy. Fortunately, iOS 18.1 introduced a simple way to start fresh. In Settings ➝ Control Center, you'll find an option to reset your Control Center to its default layout.

Choosing the Share Item Location option creates a link that lets someone view the location of a lost item when they open the link.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe link can be opened on a non-Apple device, so an iPhone or Mac is not required to provide someone with your item's location. Links expire after a week or when you're reunited with your lost item. More than 15 airlines offer the feature, which is integrated into each airline's customer service process for locating mishandled or delayed baggage, according to Apple. In addition to items equipped with an AirTag, the feature also works with third-party accessories and item trackers that support the Find My network.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Get Details About Places</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nOn iPhone 16 models, Visual Intelligence became available as of iOS 18.2.

Well, with iOS 18.3 installed, you'll be able to reveal these details with Camera Control's Visual Intelligence option, but in real time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>View Video Fullscreen in Photos</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/photos-ios-18-2-video-fullscreen-playback.jpeg\" alt=\"photos\" width=\"5386\" height=\"3030\" />\r<br />\nWhen iOS 18 was released in September, it brought a major redesign to the Photos app on the iPhone, but some of the updates received mixed feedback.

Previously, connecting your Mac through Personal Hotspot prevented the use of iPhone Mirroring.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Search Google for On-Camera Items</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-google-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nWith Visual Intelligence introduced for iPhone 16 models in iOS 18.2,  you can take a picture of any item that you see and tap on the \"Search\" option to use Google Image Search to find it on the web.

When Apple released iOS 16, however, it removed the control without explaining the reason, much to the dismay of many users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThankfully, Apple brought the control back as an option in iOS 18.2. You'll find a toggle in Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Audio &amp; Visual, labeled \"Always Show Volume Control\".

After controversy over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/apple-faces-criticism-new-notification-summaries/\">misleading summarized news headlines</a>, Apple in iOS 18.3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/ios-18-3-news-notifications-removed/\">rolled back</a> the feature's support for apps in the News and Entertainment category.

Introduced in iOS 18.2, the partnership allows Siri to handle complex requests by referring them to ChatGPT, such as generating images or creating text from scratch. With the Writing Tools feature, ChatGPT can produce and illustrate original content, expanding its capabilities beyond what Siri can currently offer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor instance, you can open a lengthy PDF and ask Siri to summarize information on a specific topic; Siri can then pass this request to ChatGPT to generate a comprehensive summary.

It requires Face ID authentication, ensuring your privacy is protected while providing insight into how AI is enhancing your iPhone experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Options in Writing Tools</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-intelligence-writing-tools-rewrite.jpg\" alt=\"notes\" width=\"4377\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\nWith successive point updates, Apple upgraded the Writing Tools feature to include options for more open-ended modifications. In iOS 18.1, Writing Tools can only adjust the tone to friendly, professional, or a simplified version. However, in iOS 18.2, users can specify the desired tone or content changes, such as incorporating more action words or transforming an email into a poem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Search Apple Music and Apple TV in Natural Language</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/ios-18-2-natural-language-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple in iOS 18.2 introduced a natural language search feature for Apple Music and Apple TV, making it easier to find what you're looking for. In the Apple TV app, you can use casual phrases to search for movies and shows. For example, you can type \"family-friendly movies,\" \"thrillers set in space,\" \"movies starring Ryan Gosling,\" or \"feel-good comedies\" to get tailored results.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Music app offers similar functionality, letting you search for songs and playlists by mood, genre, or activity. Try searches like \"upbeat workout songs,\" \"romantic ballads,\" \"90s pop hits,\" or \"songs to dance to\" to quickly discover music that fits your vibe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Test Your Hearing With AirPods Pro</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/AirPods-Pro-2-Hearing-Test-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\niOS 18.2 and later brought the AirPods Pro 2 hearing test feature to several more countries, including Cyprus, Czechia, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. This feature initially launched in the U.S. and just a few other countries with iOS 18.1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe hearing test takes about five minutes and helps adults determine if they might have hearing loss by assessing their ability to hear various sound frequencies. Once the test is complete, users receive a classification of their hearing and suggestions for next steps. For more details, Apple provides a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120991\">support document</a> explaining the feature in depth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Send Screen Content to ChatGPT</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/send-screen-content-chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"notes\" width=\"2760\" height=\"2760\" />\r<br />\nIn iOS 18.2 and later, you can ask ChatGPT a question about something on your screen, and Siri will offer to send a screenshot of it to ChatGPT or the full content as a file if it's a long document. You can use the Copy button at the top-right of the scrollable response window to copy the output to your clipboard. Alternatively, you can save useful responses by invoking Siri and saying \"Save this to my notes,\" which gives you a searchable archive of your conversations in Notes that persists after they end. This is especially useful if you aren't logged into ChatGPT and can't refer back to your account to see your chat history. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Perform Repeating Operations in Calculator</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple used its iOS 18.3 update as a chance to bring repeating operations back to the Calculator app. When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation. For example, if you tap in 10x10 and tap the equals sign to get a 100 result, if you hit equals again, it will multiply 100x10, and will continue multiplying by 10 every time you tap the equals symbol. It's a small but meaningful change that should make it easier to calculate compound interest. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Limit iPhone's Speaker Volume</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/maximum-volume-limit-ios-18-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nA feature introduced in iOS 18.2 lets you cap the maximum volume of your device's built-in speaker. It should be particularly useful if you're a parent or guardian and share your device with children, but it's also handy if you frequently find yourself in situations where sudden loud audio could be disruptive. The new \"Limit Maximum Volume\" option can be found in the Sound &amp; Haptics section of the Settings app, under the \"Volume Limit\" section.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Layer Voice Memo Recordings</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/ios-18-2-layered-voice-memos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\niOS 18.2 added layered Voice Memos recordings to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, making it easier for musicians to flesh out song ideas and experiment with new ideas. Users can layer a vocal track on top of an existing instrumental recording, with no headphones needed. Instrumental compositions can be played through the iPhone's speaker while vocals are recorded at the same time using the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ microphones. Apple says that this feature is powered by the A18 Pro chip and uses advanced processing and machine learning to isolate the vocal recording. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Battery Health Support for Third-Party Batteries</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-16-Battery-Life-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIn iOS 18.1, Apple began allowing iPhones to display battery health information for non-Apple batteries. Previously, when a third-party battery was installed, users would encounter a message indicating that the battery’s authenticity couldn't be verified, and the Battery Health feature would be disabled. But in iOS 18.1 and later, iPhones now provide battery health metrics for aftermarket batteries, accompanied by a notification stating that the data may not be entirely accurate due to the use of a non-genuine battery. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/50-iphone-features-added-ios-18-since-debut/\">50 iPhone Features Apple Added to iOS 18 Since September</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/50-iphone-features-apple-added-to-ios-18-since-september.2448397/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b0df624dec87f810dbc071f437201d863fd942ae8cc1b1255143f502a0b21a9b","category":"Apple"}
