But don't worry: Sonos is working on re-creating the problem—and has been doing so for <em>over two years.</em></p>\n<p>That's right. As an Ars reader helpfully pointed out, users have been openly complaining about their Arc startling them with a \"gunshot-esque\" or popping/cracking sound and then dropping audio until being power-cycled for years.

One user on Sonos' forum, going by William_61, described the Arc's sudden sound as much more of a blare than a pop.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960130#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960130&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c1411cf8a47403273fcfa6098f075c8a22dce1f3a42bd6461d7ee7030ff48e4c","category":"Tech"}
