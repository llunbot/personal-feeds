But his latest video is more than just mind-bending moves on a bike. It has that too, but more importantly, “Le Tour de Farm” is a tribute to his grandparents and their farm which was instrumental in developing his success on two wheels.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b162D2W2a7g?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p><strong>From Pat Smage:</strong></p><p><em><span dir=\"auto\">Growing up on this farm has made my life what it is today, and I am not even a farmer! Being able to ride bikes around the farm my whole life has led me all around the world to do just that.</span></em></p><p><em><span dir=\"auto\">While most of that is for motorcycles, it all started on bicycles. After losing my Grandpa Harold in 2017 and Grandma Joy this year, I felt like it was time for a tour of the farm, by bike of course.</span></em></p><p><em><span dir=\"auto\">While my Dad, brothers and I have done most of the trail, track, and trials area building, it was all thanks to my Grandparents who provided and let us turn their land into a playground for bikes. I am so thankful for that, and this video will always be a great reminder of how lucky I am to live here.</span></em></p><p><em><span dir=\"auto\">Huge thanks to my wife Hannah for doing so much filming for this! She put in a lot of time behind the camera and had plenty of patience for some of those tricky moves that took more than a few tries…</span></em></p><p><em><span dir=\"auto\">Thanks for watching! Also thanks to Ibis for providing the bike, PNW components for the parts to make it a little easier to ride, and POC Sports for the protection.</span></em></p><p><em><span dir=\"auto\">Videography and Photography: Hannah and Pat Smage</span></em></p><p><em><span dir=\"auto\">Edit: Pat Smage</span></em></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"89965e8f2ce3795ef718b4d4bf2d276ca7d389a4f8a451d6b94732f4b2f32268","category":"Cycling"}
