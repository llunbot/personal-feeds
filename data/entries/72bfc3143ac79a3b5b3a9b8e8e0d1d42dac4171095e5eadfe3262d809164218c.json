You can restore your apps, data, and settings from your most recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> backup, restore from a backup on your computer, or you can use device-to-device migration to transfer your data directly from your previous ‌iPhone‌ to your new one. This article shows you how to perform a wireless device-to-device migration.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-13-vs-iphone-12.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout doubt, device-to-device migration will be the most convenient option for most owners of a new ‌iPhone 13‌. It transfers over information like photos, app data, login credentials, device preferences and settings, and more. As with an ‌‌iCloud‌‌ backup, apps themselves are downloaded directly from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> rather than from your existing ‌‌iPhone‌‌. It may take a little longer than restoring from a backup, but the time saved from not having to log into all your apps again makes it worth the wait, which is why this process trumps the other transfer methods.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe following steps outline the Quick Start process that you can use to perform a wireless device-to-device migration. As always when transferring data between devices, make sure you have made a backup of your current ‌iPhone‌, just in case anything untoward happens during the migration process. \r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/back-up-iphone-ipad-on-mac/\">How to Back Up Your iPhone to a Mac</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/back-up-iphone-ipad-mac-macos-mojave-earlier/\">How to Back Up iPhone on Macs Running Mojave or Earlier</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/back-up-iphone-ipad-icloud/\">How to Back Up Your iPhone Using iCloud</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/back-up-iphone-ipad-windows-pc/\">How to Back Up Your iPhone to a Windows PC</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\nIt's also worth noting that if your current ‌iPhone‌ has an eSim plan, you'll be asked to \"Transfer Cellular Plan\" while setting up your ‌iPhone 13‌: You can either select the numbers you want to transfer or opt to Decide Later to complete the plan transfer after you've set up your ‌iPhone‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li>Plug both iPhones into a power outlet, turn on your new ‌iPhone 13‌ and place it near your current ‌iPhone‌, which needs to be running iOS 12.4 or later for the transfer to work. The Quick Start screen will appear on your current ‌iPhone‌ and offer the option of using your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> to set up your new device. Make sure that it's the ‌Apple ID‌ that you want to use, then tap Continue.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Hold up your current ‌iPhone‌ and center the camera's viewfinder over the animation that appears on your ‌iPhone 13‌. Wait for a message that says \"Finish on New ‌iPhone‌.\"\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/set-up-iphone-13.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>When prompted, enter your current passcode on your new ‌iPhone 13‌.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Follow the instructions to set up Face ID on your ‌iPhone 13‌.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap Transfer from ‌iPhone‌ to start transferring your data to your ‌iPhone 13‌. You should be given the choice of whether to transfer some additional settings, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, to your new ‌iPhone‌.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>If you have an Apple Watch paired to your current ‌iPhone‌, you'll be asked if you want to transfer your Apple Watch data and settings.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Keep the two iPhones near each other and plugged into power until the data migration process is finished.</li></ol>The amount of time that it takes to transfer data from one ‌‌iPhone‌‌ to another will vary based on what's on the existing ‌‌iPhone‌‌, but Apple provides a data transfer estimate on the main data transfer screen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the wireless network you're relying on is too slow, you can perform the data migration using a wired connection, but for that you'll need a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W2AM/A/lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter\">Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adaptor</a> and a Lightning to USB Cable. Connect the Camera Adaptor into your current ‌iPhone‌, then plug the Lightning to USB Cable into your ‌iPhone 13‌ and the other end into the adaptor. You'll then be able to follow the steps outlined above.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you plan to sell or trade in your old ‌iPhone‌ to get a bit of extra cash, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/erase-your-old-iphone-or-ipad/\">make sure to adequately erase everything on it</a> to get it ready for its next owner.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/transfer-current-iphone-data-to-iphone-13/\">Here's the Best Way to Transfer Data From Your Old iPhone to Your New iPhone 13</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-the-best-way-to-transfer-data-from-your-old-iphone-to-your-new-iphone-13.2313036/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8xOChcVkjew:rv0l-Ae73R0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8xOChcVkjew:rv0l-Ae73R0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/8xOChcVkjew\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"72bfc3143ac79a3b5b3a9b8e8e0d1d42dac4171095e5eadfe3262d809164218c","category":"Apple"}
