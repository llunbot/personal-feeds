In-store pickup may be one of the only ways to get a ‌‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ immediately as mail orders are already facing moderate delays of around one to two weeks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $99 in the United States, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ attaches magnetically to the back of the ‌iPhone 12 mini‌, ‌iPhone 12‌, ‌iPhone 12 Pro‌, or ‌iPhone 12 Pro Max‌, providing additional hours of battery life. Apple says the battery pack is able to wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> at up to 5W on the go, or at up to 15W when the battery pack is connected to a 20W or higher power adapter with a Lightning to USB-C cable.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/magsafe-battery-pack-available-for-in-store-pickup/\">MagSafe Battery Pack Now Available for Apple Store Pickup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magsafe-battery-pack-now-available-for-apple-store-pickup.2304843/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JyXc8dSK8Fk:ZNXcGiFJmAo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JyXc8dSK8Fk:ZNXcGiFJmAo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JyXc8dSK8Fk\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"45899f37408464623234e973502af73d3ed2f369843a95f0bfdbb8a7d3364771","category":"Apple"}
