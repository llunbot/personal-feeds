Apple says that it addressed a baseband security flaw that could allow an attacker \"in a privileged network position\" to intercept network traffic. Basically, a hacker that had access to cellular network infrastructure could potentially exploit the vulnerability for surveillance or to employ a man-in-the-middle attack.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe C1's baseband is used for signal processing, so it encodes and decodes data for communication between devices and networks, and processes calls, texts, and data connections. Apple addressed the vulnerability with improved state management, which could mean new validation checks to prevent attackers from exploiting weaknesses between operational states.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released the ‌iPhone 16e‌ earlier this year, and today's security update is notable because it marks the first security flaw discovered and addressed in the C1 modem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.5 also includes several other security fixes for vulnerabilities with image processing, call history, Bluetooth, file parsing, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, Notes, ProRes, WebKit, and more. None of the vulnerabilities fixed today were known to have been actively exploited, but it's still a good idea to update right away.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-ios-18-5-c1-security-fix/\">Apple's C1 Modem Gets First Security Update in iOS 18.5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-c1-modem-gets-first-security-update-in-ios-18-5.2456952/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cbfddfae7393b7fd4d1fc786526192482b91377d9ad14172affb2d9c896f1d0a","category":"Apple"}
