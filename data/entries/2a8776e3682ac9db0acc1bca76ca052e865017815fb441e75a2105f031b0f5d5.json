Unfortunately, the breed is particularly prone to getting overweight, and this tendency apparently is more severe in Labradors purpose-bred for service. To figure out the reasons behind this, researchers at Cambridge University investigated potential obesity genes in Labrador retrieversâ€™ DNA.</p>\n<p>It turned out increased obesity risk in Labradors was linked to the same genes and mechanisms that cause obesity in humans. These gene variants were more common in purpose-bred dogs we carefully selected, generation after generation, to maximize the results of the demanding training programs service animals must go through.</p>\n<p>We thought we were picking the smartest Labradors to become guide dogs. But we might have been picking the ones that just wanted the snacks given as rewards the most.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/have-we-accidentally-bred-some-dogs-for-obesity/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/have-we-accidentally-bred-some-dogs-for-obesity/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2a8776e3682ac9db0acc1bca76ca052e865017815fb441e75a2105f031b0f5d5","category":"Tech"}
