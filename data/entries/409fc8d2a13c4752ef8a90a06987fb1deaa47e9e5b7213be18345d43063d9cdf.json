Nintendo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1709418623566020975?\">announced overnight</a> that \"online play and other functionality that uses online communication\" on those consoles will stop working in \"early April 2024,\" just over a year after Nintendo <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/todays-the-last-day-to-buy-eshop-games-for-the-wii-u-and-3ds/\">shut off downloadable game purchases</a> on both platforms through the eShop.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/\">a brief FAQ</a>, Nintendo clarified that players will still be able to redownload purchased software and download game update data \"for the foreseeable future.\" Players will also still be able to transfer Pokémon off of a 3DS <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-ultra-moon-review-welcome-back-my-friends/\">using the Pokémon Bank system</a> after the planned shutdown. And software that uses the 3DS's <a href=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/alone-in-the-streetpass-crowd/\">unique Street Pass system</a> will also still work since it uses local wireless communication between systems without the need for a central server.</p>\n<p>While there are still some people using this now-classic Nintendo hardware online, spot tests suggest that the player numbers aren't huge these days. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKqnX9n7fz4\">GameXplain test from the beginning of 2023</a> found a handful of online players for <em>Mario Kart 8</em> and Call of Duty games on Wii U, for instance, but failed to find opponents for <em>Super Smash Bros. for Wii U</em> and <em>Mario Tennis Ultra Smash</em>. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz2sqX91BA0\">similar 3DS test by a YouTuber</a> in January found similarly mixed results, though 3DS launch titles like <em>Super Street Fighter 4</em> and <em>Steel Divers</em> still apparently had surprisingly strong online communities.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973150#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973150&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"409fc8d2a13c4752ef8a90a06987fb1deaa47e9e5b7213be18345d43063d9cdf","category":"Tech"}
