To a rider who spends almost all their time cutting about in winter-like conditions on steep, loamy hillsides, the two very different tread patterns of the Front and Rear tires initially seemed an odd pairing to me; the Front is very open and aggressive with large cornering lugs, while the rear is lower in profile with smaller lugs. That said, we did also get some dry, loose trail conditions during our time testing the Michelin Wild Enduro tires.

The cornering lugs aren’t <em>super stiff</em>, though.

A great test for the open and aggressive tread pattern of the Michelin Wild Enduro Front Tire. It is in these conditions where the tire excels, delivering unprecedented levels of cornering grip. As you put the tire on its edge, you can feel, and hear, the side knobs cut through the soft, top layer of greasy loam, biting the firmer terrain sitting just below the surface.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner.jpg\" alt=\"michelin wild enduro front tire review gum-x3d compound wet riding conditions bermed corner\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>I’ve had some really great rides on this tire, and I put that down to the confidence it gives me in wet and wintery trail conditions.

For me, the relatively firm cornering lugs don’t offer quite enough flex to be forgiving when you lean the bike over too far, or, let’s face it, with insufficient angulation technique. The grip is great and reliable up and to a point, until all of a sudden it is gone entirely; what I mean to say is, there’s very little warning that you’re approaching the edge of your grip, thus not much time to correct before the front wheel washes out.</p><p>Conclusion: The Michelin Wild Enduro GUM-X3D is a great tire for winter riding in the UK, offering often unfathomable levels of cornering grip in the sloppiest trail conditions. Bite is excellent under braking.</p><h3>Riding the Michelin Wild Enduro Rear&nbsp;</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound.jpg\" alt=\"michelin wild enduro rear tire review wet conditions\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124127/michelin-wild-enduro-rear-tire-review-gum-x-compound-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>The tread pattern of the Wild Enduro Rear, and my riding impressions of it thus far, leave me a little confused as to what the designers were going for with this pairing. While the Front and Rear tires are very good in their own right, for me at least, they don’t seem to complement each other on the trail.</p><p>Let’s be clear; wet weather riding is what I am most familiar and comfortable with, hence my delight at how well the Wild Enduro Front tire performs in soft, muddy conditions. I have to say, however, that the Rear tire is a little disappointing in those same conditions. While the Front tire is working hard cutting through mud and biting the terrain for front wheel grip in corners, the rear tire is having an absolute party out back.</p><figure id=\"attachment_269073\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-269073\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions.jpg\" alt=\"michelin wild enduro rear review testing wet conditions\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124144/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-riding-conditions-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-269073\">The Michelin Wild Enduro Rear Tire performs well in supportive bermed corners, but can get quite exciting on flatter corners or off camber sections of sloppy trails</figcaption></figure><p>And by party, I mean fish tailing. The smaller, lower profile centre-tread blocks and smaller cornering lugs do leave a lot to be desired on softer, wet terrain, to the point where they are often unable to cut through deep enough to find purchase, leaving the rear wheel sliding about, wildly. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a hell of a lot of fun, but may not give you that super clean, precise run you’re after.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review.jpg\" alt=\"michelin wild enduro rear\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03084416/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-tire-rear-review-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>It’s on dry hard pack trails where the Michelin Wild Enduro Rear Tire excels. The lower profile knobs result in a tire that actually feels pretty fast rolling. It provides sufficient grip under braking, without being so burly that you can’t make it slide a little when the trail demands it. I’m not talking about radical shralping (that particular skill isn’t in my repertoire), more simply locking the back wheel up and letting it slide around tighter turns.</p><p>Conclusion: The Michelin Wild Enduro Rear Tire may disappoint in slippery trail conditions, lacking sufficient bite for steep, wet, technical climbs, but it performs well on dry hard pack terrain.&nbsp;</p><h4>What about side wall support?</h4><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions.jpg\" alt=\"cornering michelin wild enduro tires wet trail conditions\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124138/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-cornering-wet-conditions-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>Michelin state that the Michelin Wild Enduro Tires we tested should not be ridden at pressures lower than 26.1 PSI. To be clear, I never run my tires anywhere near that, and I’m not about to start pumping them up firmer anytime soon. In the wet, I ran the Wild Enduro Front tire as low as 17 PSI with absolutely no adverse effects whatsoever.&nbsp;</p><p>Granted, you can get away with a lot on slower speed trails with soft terrain. But, to be fair, I didn’t put too much more air in for dry hard pack trails (20 PSI at most, so still well below the minimum recommended by the manufacturer). Still, I felt no adverse effects. Pushing the tires into hard pack bermed corners at speed, I never felt any vagueness or evidence of wallowing side walls. That said, it’s important you guys are aware that I weigh around 60 kg, and while I credit myself with some aggression in my riding style, I am certainly no Isabeau Courdurier.</p><p>I am pleased to report a complete absence of punctures during the month long testing period.
