The national network has been tracking the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 8-year-olds at a handful of sites since 2000, publishing estimates every two years. In 2000, ASD prevalence was 1 in 150, with white children from high-income communities having the highest rates of the developmental disability. In 2020, when the rate hit 1 in 36, it was the first year in which higher ASD rates were seen in underserved communities. That year, researchers also noted that the link between ASD and socioeconomic status evaporated in most of the network.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/autism-rate-rises-from-2-76-to-3-22-likely-due-to-better-testing-access/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/autism-rate-rises-from-2-76-to-3-22-likely-due-to-better-testing-access/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e717f2fb1b0b3a8841553e649d8c725c3944f15b279daac12d88507a858e1591","category":"Tech"}
