The first is Swippitt Link, a battery case for the iPhone. The second is a toaster-like device called the Swippitt Hub that houses and charges five batteries that work in the Link case. When you insert the Swippitt Link-encased iPhone into the Hub, the battery in the Link is swapped out with one of the charged batteries in the Hub. See the video below for a demonstration of how it works.</p>\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n<p>So to call Swippitt a “battery charger” isn’t accurate, though it does charge batteries, but just the ones for the Swippitt Link. It’s really a battery system, where the Hub swaps out batteries with the Link case, and then charges the swapped battery. Swapping out the battery takes only a few seconds–a lot faster than waiting for a fast charge via USB. The Hub holds five batteries and uses proprietary software to manage the batteries so that they’re ready to be swapped. Since it holds five batteries, a Hub can support up to five users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swippitt is compatible with the iPhone 14, 15, and 16 models, and the company says it will create new Link cases should Apple introduce new iPhones designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This charging convenience has a hefty price, starting at $450 for the Swippitt Hub which measures a sizeable 13.2 by 11.4 by 6.8 inches (335.6 by 288.7 by 172.5 mm), and $120 for the Swippitt Link case. The device starts shipping in June and the company is accepting pre-orders with a 30-percent discount during the Consumer Electronic Show this week.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Instant Power System</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$45 Swippitt Hub | $120 Swippitt Link\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.swippitt.com/products/swippitt-system\" target=\"_blank\">$570 at  Swippitt</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"93817990da898d466243c30f2705448b0a26176d83df86468abdb925987dc696","category":"Apple"}
