There are now three rumored features for the iPhone 17 Air that should contribute to the device having longer battery life than some might have expected, including the high-density battery calls, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-battery-life-promising/\">Apple's power-efficient C1 modem</a>, and the lack of an Ultra Wide camera <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-teardown/\">providing more internal space for a larger battery</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 Air in September. Kuo previously said the device will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">measure just 5.5mm</a> at its thinnest point.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/iphone-17-air-high-density-battery-rumor/\">'iPhone 17 Air' Rumored to Feature 'High-Density' Battery</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-rumored-to-feature-high-density-battery.2452214/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1da440cf4cfcc23b339f9695403f827e8b69fac31613d45b278c4f817a4a86d2","category":"Apple"}
