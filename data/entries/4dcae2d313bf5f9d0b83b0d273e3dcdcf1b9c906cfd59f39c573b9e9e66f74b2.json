There are no updates to the calipers, save for the Dark Polar anodized finish – it’s the lever bodies that are of concern here. Even then, there is no major functional update, only the more streamlined cockpit setup that results from the master cylinder positioning against the handlebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth mentioning though, is the fact that the pivot on the levers of the Stealth Ultimate and Stealth Silver brakes run on a bearing, while the Stealth Bronze levers pivot about a bushing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-bronze-stealth-brakes-clean-cockpit.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>All SRAM Stealth brake levers utilize the same MatchMaker X handlebar clamp system that Code, G2, Level, and DB8 currently use</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stealth Bronze brakes are the most affordable brakes in SRAM’s lineup that get a lever body positioned so neatly. Caliper and lever bodies are made of a forged aluminum, while the lever blades are stamped aluminum. Meanwhile the Silver Stealth and Ultimate Stealth brakes are made of lighter weight materials, especially the Ultimate which sees a carbon lever blade and titanium hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stealth update is not only beneficial for bikes where the cables are routed through the headset. SRAM ship the Stealth brakes with stem clips for use with stems that have a specified gap between the stem body and face-plate on the two lower bolts; these will help keep any rattling to a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-caliper-dark-polar-800x1008.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-caliper-dark-polar-800x1008.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-caliper-dark-polar-800x1008.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-caliper-dark-polar-800x1008.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-caliper-dark-polar-800x1008.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" alt src=\"https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-caliper-dark-polar-800x1008.jpg?ssl=1\" /></figure></div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-lever-dark-polar-800x503.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-lever-dark-polar-800x503.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-lever-dark-polar-800x503.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-lever-dark-polar-800x503.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-lever-dark-polar-800x503.jpg?strip=info&amp;w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" alt src=\"https://i2.wp.com/bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sram-code-bronze-stealth-lever-dark-polar-800x503.jpg?ssl=1\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The most powerful of the Bronze Stealth brakes launching today is the Code variety, a 4-piston brake utilizing Swing Link technology in the lever for a progressive braking feel.
