Regardless of what Phil says, many of us still have plenty of snow on the ground and cold temperatures in the forecast. Ornot is here with some new apparel to make the cold days good days on the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Magic Shell Jacket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_01.webp\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_01.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Magic Shell Jacket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_01.webp 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_01-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_01-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_01-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_02.webp\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_02.webp\" alt=\"Ornot Magic Shell Jacket open\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_02.webp 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_02-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_02-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MagicShell_Jacket_StoneBlue_02-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Polartec Power Shield fabric used on the Magic Shell is breathable enough for use as an everyday cycling jacket, while bonded and taped seams allow it to be called 99% wind and water proof.

Actually made in California, the soft and stretchy fabric allows easy layering from 55 to 32 degrees and has a two-way YKK zipper for temperature regulation on the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely breathable microporous hydrophobic membrane.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Perfect from 55 degrees to below freezing with appropriate layers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bonded and taped seams</li>\n\n\n\n<li>99% windproof and waterproof</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Updated 2-layer Cuff</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stretchy and Quiet – Doesn’t flap in the wind</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Constructed with bluesign®-approved materials, which conserve resources and protect the environment’s health, workers, and you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>YKK 2-way double zipper.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>255 grams (size small).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Size-specific rear pockets, secure zipper pocket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low-key reflective detailing on front and back.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PFAS Free DWR coating + bluesign®-approved fabric.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made in California!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MSRP: $285</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Merino Grid Jersey</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_03-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_03-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Ornot merino grid jersey\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_03-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_03-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_03-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_03-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_03-2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_04-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_04-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Ornot merino grid jersey back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_04-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_04-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_04-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_04-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Mens_MerinoGrid_Charcoal_04-2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ornot’s Merino Grid is made in the USA from deadstock Polartec Power Wool, with everything you love about extra-fine merino wool (antimicrobial, wicking, and keeping you warm even when wet). The grid structure helps trap air pockets to keep you warm under a layer, but it quickly breathes and dumps heat when worn alone. Bonus: Merino Wool is capable of wicking moisture in the vapor state, keeping you more comfortable and less sweaty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Merino wool interior – Naturally wicking, thermoregulating, and odor-resistant.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Durable abrasion-resistant face.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Constructed with bluesign®-approved materials that conserve resources and protect the environment’s health, workers, and you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Temp range from 45-60 degrees and is perfect for layering.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2-way YKK zipper.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3 rear pockets, secure zipper pocket, reflective details.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shape retention and 4-way stretch for all-day comfort.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>54% recycled poly, 38% wool, 8% spandex (merino wool is placed on the inside)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sewn by hand in the USA.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MSRP: $176.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Decadent Cap</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Decadent_Cap_Slate_02-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Decadent_Cap_Slate_02-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Ornot decadent cap\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Decadent_Cap_Slate_02-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Decadent_Cap_Slate_02-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Decadent_Cap_Slate_02-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Decadent_Cap_Slate_02-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ornot_Decadent_Cap_Slate_02-2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Made from domestically sourced Polartec Power Wool, this USA-made Merino Wool Blend fabric claims to be the softest fabric Ornot has ever used.

Made in the SF Bay Area with US-milled fabric weighing a scant 44 grams, this cap easily packs into your back pocket or handlebar Bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Designed and sewn in California.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made from Deadstock Fabric Milled in the USA</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Naturally odor resistant</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flatlock stitching</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Small brim to keep the rain out of your eyes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fold-down / Flip-up ear flaps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Temp range 30-50</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One size fits most heads. 21.5″-24.5″</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Constructed with bluesign®-approved materials that conserve resources and protect the environment’s health, workers, and you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>44 grams</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MSRP: $54.00</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ornot-deep-winter-drop-new-magic-shell-jacket-grid-merino-jersey-amp-decadent-cap/\">Ornot Deep Winter Drop: New Magic Shell Jacket, Grid Merino Jersey &amp; Decadent Cap</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8817f39f90d11f8268990bc8d640a6b7c675956f3a93e782cf7e99497bb5beae","category":"Cycling"}
