This actual president\ncannot. He did not reason himself into his preoccupation with\ntariffs and can neither reason nor speak coherently about them.\nThere is no grand plan or strategic vision, no matter what his\nadvisers claim — only the impulsive actions of a mad king,\nuntethered from any responsibility to the nation or its people.\nFor as much as the president’s apologists would like us to believe\notherwise, Trump’s tariffs are not a policy as we traditionally\nunderstand it. What they are is an instantiation of his psyche: a\nconcrete expression of his zero-sum worldview. [...]</p>\n\n<p>You could even say that this need to dominate — this overwhelming\ndrive to show mastery — is constitutive of Trump’s self. There\nmust be a loser, or else there is no Trump. [...] The upshot of\nthis understanding of Trump’s personality is that there is no\npoint at which he can be satisfied. He will always want more: more\nsupplicants to obey his next command, more displays of his power\nand authority and more opportunities to trample over those who\ndon’t belong in his America.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s no point to this other than a vain attempt to get every other country in the world to come begging to Donald Trump for mercy. Which isn’t going to happen.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/13/jamelle-bouie-on-trumps-tariff-obsession\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8b22d9c300ff12f465be817787cb53c2c406531f6738e163dbd6204d499fc145","category":"Tech"}
