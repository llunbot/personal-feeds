Blogging is a hustle and the incentives for hyperbole and\nbreathlessness are endless. That makes most people easy to ignore.\nBut Kevin — who had a whole career in the normal-person rat race\nbefore he started this — sweated the details. He had a serious\nmind for facts and numbers and he knew how to work with data. His\nposts were always overflowing with numbers and charts and levels\nof detail and nitty gritty I couldn’t pile into my brain because I\nwas too scattered and unfocused. When he said something, you had\nto take it seriously. When he disagreed with you, you knew it was\ntime to re-check your work. Kevin was almost all signal and very\nlittle noise. That was his defining mark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/marshall-drum\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c0a569c1475c207f6b61ff1622ce50d5f127c0a705b1aa6f65385d8a86576ec1","category":"Tech"}
