We hope you'll come to love it. Ars Technica is a little more than 26 years old, yet this is only our ninth site relaunch (number eight was rolled out way back in 2016!).</p>\n<p>We think the Ars experience gets better with each iteration, and this time around, we've brought a ton of behind-the-scenes improvements aimed squarely at making the site faster, more readable, and more customizable. We've added responsive design, larger text, and more viewing options. We've also added the highly requested \"Most Read\" box so you can find our hottest stories at a glance. And if you're a subscriber, you can now hide certain topics that we coverâ€”and never see those stories again.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/welcome-to-our-latest-design-update-ars-9-0/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/welcome-to-our-latest-design-update-ars-9-0/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ken Fisher","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"47234f22fdd74422d1e3a23f01eafbe6d9a9d485530594e0520eee679f67310b","category":"Tech"}
