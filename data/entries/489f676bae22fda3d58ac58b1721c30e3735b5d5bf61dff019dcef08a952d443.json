On Wednesday, engineers rolled a full-scale New Glenn rocket, partially made up of flight hardware, to a launch pad in Florida for ground testing.</p>\n<p>The first New Glenn launch is almost certainly at least six months away, and it may not even happen this year. In the last few years, observers inside and outside the space industry have become accustomed to the nearly annual ritual of another New Glenn launch delay. New Glenn's inaugural flight has been delayed from 2020 until 2021, then 2022, and for now, is slated for later this year.</p>\n<p>But it feels different now. Blue Origin is obviously moving closer to finally launching a rocket into orbit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005444#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005444&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"489f676bae22fda3d58ac58b1721c30e3735b5d5bf61dff019dcef08a952d443","category":"Tech"}
