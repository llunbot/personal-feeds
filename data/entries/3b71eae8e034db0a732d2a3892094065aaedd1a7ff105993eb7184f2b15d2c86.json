It's December 8, and today's photo comes from the floor of the Grand Canyon. The photographer, Mitchell Yee, admits that this is not the best shot one might capture from this remote location, but there's a reason—he shot it on his iPhone in August.</p>\n<p>\"While it's a fairly ordinary photo, what was amazing to me was the level of quality of cell phone photography,\" he told me. \"Normally, I'd haul out my big Nikon but since we were hiking down to the bottom of the canyon to meet our dories, weight was constrained. So I skipped the extra 15–20 pounds of camera, lens(es), and tripod and instead enjoyed the 9-mile hike with my 18-pound pack. Of course, this shot could have been much improved with a 'real' camera on a tripod. But there I was, flat on my back on a sand berm, with the best camera I had at that moment, my iPhone 13 mini, and I still made the shot I wanted.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989587#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989587&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b71eae8e034db0a732d2a3892094065aaedd1a7ff105993eb7184f2b15d2c86","category":"Tech"}
