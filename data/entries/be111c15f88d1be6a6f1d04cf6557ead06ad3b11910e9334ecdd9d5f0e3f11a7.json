She is also David Millar’s sister, but really that’s just a footnote to a fascinating career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Fran talks candidly about the problems at Rapha – and why they will solve them; life working alongside Dave Brailsford at Sky, including developing and propagating their famous winning mentality; what went wrong at Ineos Grenadiers (and it’s not what you might think); what it’s like having David Millar as a brother; and whether TNT’s new TV cycling deal is about to kill British cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 15:05</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/129-rapha-ceo-fran-milller-on-team-sky-success-ineos-implosi\"
