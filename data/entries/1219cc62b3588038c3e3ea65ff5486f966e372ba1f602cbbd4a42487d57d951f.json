In 2020, Musk <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-to-discuss-teslas-banner-year-despite-pandemic-silicon-valleys-future-11607449988\">personally relocated to Texas</a>, which is home to SpaceX facilities and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/05/report-tesla-plans-to-build-a-new-car-factory-in-texas/\">a new Tesla factory</a> outside Austin. Now the Texas state capital will be the new official home of Tesla, too.</p>\n<p>In 2020, Musk was at loggerheads with the California government in response to public health measures enacted to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans.

Within days, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/05/report-tesla-plans-to-build-a-new-car-factory-in-texas/\">Musk revealed that he had picked Texas</a> for the site of Tesla's next American factory.
