And here’s a bonus tip: If you use a Target card, you can get an extra 5 percent back for another $5 in savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple gift card can be used to buy anything Apple sells, including subscriptions, movies, music, and of course, devices. The offer is good on any denomination as long as it adds up to at least $100. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gift card will automatically appear in the cart. You can only get one offer per purchase. We tried to make a second purchase as Target has previously allowed and the order was canceled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offer is good until Saturday, November 27, but we recommend getting one now so you can use it during Apple’s Black Friday shopping event, which should begin Friday.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"479fb578bae129c6ca573830a9a101a5f53bb606559a4cd7cebca123b3626cd7","category":"Apple"}
