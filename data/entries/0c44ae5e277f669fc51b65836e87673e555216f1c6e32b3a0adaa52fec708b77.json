As warm-blooded creatures, however, we generate heat all the time, and that heat can be converted into electricity for some of the electronic gadgetry we carry.</p>\n<p>Flexible thermoelectric devices, or F-TEDs, can convert thermal energy into electric power. The problem is that F-TEDs werenâ€™t actually flexible enough to comfortably wear or efficient enough to power even a smartwatch. They were also very expensive to make.</p>\n<p>But now, a team of Australian researchers thinks they finally achieved a breakthrough that might take F-TEDs off the ground.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/thermoelectric-material-gets-flexible-efficient/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/thermoelectric-material-gets-flexible-efficient/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0c44ae5e277f669fc51b65836e87673e555216f1c6e32b3a0adaa52fec708b77","category":"Tech"}
