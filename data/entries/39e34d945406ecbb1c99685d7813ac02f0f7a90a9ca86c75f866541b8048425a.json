If no-one joins, the call doesn't go ahead. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn contrast, voice chats can be initiated in a group without anyone joining, and users are prompted to join discreetly via a silent push notification. The feature is available for those WhatsApp groups with 33 to 128 members.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGroup members not participating in the voice chat can see who is active in the call from the chat header and the Calls tab, and people can join or leave at any time. If the encrypted chat remains empty for 60 minutes, it automatically ends.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs noted by <a href=\"https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-voice-chats-for-large-groups-on-android-and-ios/\">WABetaInfo</a>, the feature is now appearing for users on iOS and Android who have installed the latest WhatsApp update from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and Google Play Store, respectively.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/whatsapp-rolls-out-voice-chats-for-large-groups/\">WhatsApp Rolls Out Voice Chats for Large Groups</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-rolls-out-voice-chats-for-large-groups.2411014/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"39e34d945406ecbb1c99685d7813ac02f0f7a90a9ca86c75f866541b8048425a","category":"Apple"}
