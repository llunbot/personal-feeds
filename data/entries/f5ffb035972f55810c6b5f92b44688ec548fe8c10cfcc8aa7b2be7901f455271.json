Digital writer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/nickclark/\">Nick Clark</a> will be finding out as he slays the trails aboard the La Sal Peak over the next year, so look out for his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/long-term-reviews/\">long-term review</a> soon.</p>\n<p>For now, let’s take a closer look at this intriguing build.</p>\n<h2>A future-proofed frameset design</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak against a graffiti background\" title=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak against a graffiti background\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The La Sal mountain range peaks at 3,877m elevation.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Named after the mountain range in Moab, Utah, the direct-to-consumer brand’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro mountain bike</a> sports 170mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a> front and rear.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its TetraLink suspension design, Fezarri claims the bike climbs like it has less travel and descends as if it had more.</p>\n<p>The La Sal Peak is constructed from what Fezzari calls ‘Clean Cast’ carbon fibre, including the rocker link.</p>\n<p>Unlike other manufacturers who wrap carbon sheets around a bladder, Fezarri says its carbon construction process uses proprietary tooling designs and a different type of internal mould to hold the carbon in place during manufacturing. This is said to eliminate any overlapping fibres that add unnecessary weight and create possible voids.</p>\n<p>Fezarri claims a frameset weight of 2,900g in an unspecified size.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak TetraLink suspension design\" title=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak TetraLink suspension design\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Fezzari uses its TetraLink suspension design to deliver its 170mm of travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Like the brand’s other bikes, the La Sal Peak uses Fezzari’s TetraLink Horst Link <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">suspension system</a> to deliver a balance between “playful manoeuvrability and composed stability”.</p>\n<p>Although the bike is designed around a 170mm travel fork and shock, Fezzari says you could run a 180mm or even a 190/203mm dual-crown fork if you wish. The brand says you can also run a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">coil shock</a>, providing you run M8x30 shock mounting hardware to achieve the correct clearance.</p>\n<p>There’s a flip chip called the GA link which allows you to alter the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/extreme-geometry-vs-race-geometry/\">geometry</a> and run the bike with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet</a> setup. The brand recommends running it in the High setting if you do run it as a mullet.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak cable routing\" title=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak cable routing\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s nothing more annoying than the sound of cables rattling inside the frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The internal cable routing for the rear brake, rear shifter and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> is fully sleeved and the cable guides are claimed to be rattle-proof.</p>\n<p>The La Sal Peak accepts a 31.6mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a> and has a 1 ⅛ to 1.5in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/\">headset</a> standard.</p>\n<p>It also incorporates ISCG-05 mounts for chain guides or bash guards.</p>\n<p>The La Sal Peak can accept a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyre</a> up to 29×2.6in wide at the rear.</p>\n<p>The bike uses a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">SRAM UDH</a> hanger, so you could upgrade it to a <a

standard</a>, with Fezzari saying: “Our philosophy is simple – if the bike is intended to be ridden in the dirt, it gets a threaded bottom bracket”.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, there’s custom moulded down tube, shuttle pad and chainstay protectors.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak against a graffiti wall\" title=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak against a graffiti wall\"

\n<h3>What is Bike of the Week?</h3>\n<p>Every fortnight, we’ll bring you a detailed first look at one of the latest bikes (or framesets) to arrive at BikeRadar HQ – from road to commuting, gravel to enduro, and anything in between.</p>\n<p>This is our chance to introduce the bike and everything that makes it unique before hitting the road or trails.</p>\n<p>Head to our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/\">Bike of the Week hub</a> for previous editions.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Size-specific, progressive geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak cable guides\" title=\"Fezzari La Sal Peak cable guides\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s nothing more annoying than the sound of cables rattling inside the frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Fezzari says it incorporates rider fit and comfort in the design process of its bikes by taking a look at decades of real-world rider-fit data.</p>\n<p>The brand says the La Sal Peak’s geometry is size-specific so every size bike delivers the same ride experience.</p>\n<p>With the updated suspension kinematic, the La Sal Peak Elite sports a slack 63.5 degree head tube angle.</p>\n<p>The chainstays have been lengthened by 2mm to 437mm chainstays over its predecessor,  which Fezzari says keeps the bike light on its wheels in tight turns.</p>\n<p>The seat tube angle varies among frame sizes, with a size medium receiving a 77.5 degree effective seat tube angle and a 455mm reach.</p>\n<p>If you’re running the bike as a mullet on an equivalent sized frame, you can expect the head tube angle to steepen to 64.2 degrees, the effective seat tube angle to 78.7 degrees and the reach to 465.7mm.</p>\n<h2>A dependable spec list</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Zeb Ultimate fork high speed and low speed compression
