The $3,000 device, which contains Nvidia's new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, debuted at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. It will launch in May and can operate as a standalone PC or connect to a Windows or Mac machine.</p>\n<p>At CES on Monday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the new system as \"a cloud computing platform that sits on your desk.\" The company also designed Project DIGITS as a bridge between desktop development and cloud deployment. Developers can create and test AI applications locally on Project DIGITS, then move them to cloud services or data centers that use similar Nvidia hardware.</p>\n<p>The GB10 chip inside the Project DIGITS computer combines an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/\">Nvidia Blackwell GPU</a> with a 20-core Grace CPU based on Arm architecture.
