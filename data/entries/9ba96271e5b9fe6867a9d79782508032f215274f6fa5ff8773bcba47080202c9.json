The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/\">iPhone 16e</a> is a 6.1-inch phone with an edge-to-edge OLED screen and a display notch, an Apple A18 processor inside (similar to, though not exactly the same as, the regular iPhone 16), a USB-C port and Action Button, and Apple's first in-house cellular modem, dubbed the Apple C1.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 16e <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16e\">starts at $599 for 128GB</a>, and will go up for pre-orders on February 21st. The phone will be available on February 28th. A 256GB version and a 512GB version will run you $699 and $899, respectively.</p>\n<p>At $599, the iPhone 16e's starting price is $200 less than the iPhone 16, but a whopping $170 more than the old 64GB iPhone SE, and $120 more than the 128GB version of the iPhone SE. The 16e is a more direct replacement for the iPhone 14, which Apple started selling for $599 when the standard iPhone 16 was released. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have both been discontinued, which means that Apple is no longer selling any new phones that use Lightning ports instead of USB-C.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/apple-announces-iphone-16e-to-replace-iphone-se-starts-at-599-for-128gb/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/apple-announces-iphone-16e-to-replace-iphone-se-starts-at-599-for-128gb/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9ba96271e5b9fe6867a9d79782508032f215274f6fa5ff8773bcba47080202c9","category":"Tech"}
