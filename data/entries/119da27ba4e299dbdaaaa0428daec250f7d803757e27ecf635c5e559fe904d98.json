Known as V2H, or bidirectional charging, it's a relatively simple idea: an EV is a giant battery on wheels, so why not be able to use that to power other things? GM says the rollout will begin with model-year 2024 EVs and will continue through to model-year 2026.</p>\n<p>There are actually a couple of different approaches to using an EV's battery to power non-car stuff. An increasing number of EVs like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/weve-driven-volkswagens-retro-cool-id-buzz-electric-minivan/\">Volkswagen ID. Buzz</a> offer AC outlets, and, depending on the region, can provide either 120 V or 240 V power. That is usually known as vehicle to load, or V2L.</p>\n<p>V2H amps things up a bit—quite literally—by sending power from the car back into a home electrical circuit, similar to a home storage battery. Nissan demoed but never implemented the idea for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/12/the-all-new-2018-nissan-leaf-driven/\">the second-generation Leaf back in 2018</a>, but Ford did implement it with its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/05/the-most-important-ev-of-the-decade-we-drive-the-f-150-lightning/\">F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959496#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959496&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
