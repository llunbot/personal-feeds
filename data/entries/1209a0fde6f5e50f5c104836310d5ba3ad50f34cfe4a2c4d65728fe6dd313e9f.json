It’s a compact but not tiny ratchet driver for 1/4″ bits, with the added benefit of a beam-style torque wrench built into the end. Roll it all up in a handy carrying case and it’s small enough to tuck into your pack for rides, strap directly to a bike, or toss in the car for trailhead adjustments. It’s a nice solution, but not perfect. And also, it’s not really all that new. We’ve seen variations of this wrench for more than 5 years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Granite Design’s RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Design RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit tool roll review, with red bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_red-carrying-case-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Granite)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a precise torque wrench – stop reading now and go browse our site <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=%22torque+wrench%22\" target=\"_blank\">for something more suitable</a>. This ratcheting mini-tool includes a torque function. But with a hard-to-gauge torque ‘window’ and a claimed accuracy of just +/-15%, it is more of a tool to give you a ballpark idea of how much torque you are putting into a bolt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also not really a new product. We already wrote about this same tool several years back when PrestaCycle first introduced it in <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hands-on-prestacycle-torqratchet-3-way-ratchet-put-a-new-spin-on-mini-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">2018</a>, then updated it to this exact version in <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prestacycle-shows-worlds-smallest-lightest-pump-new-tire-plugger-ratchet-more/\" target=\"_blank\">2021</a>. This one is open-mold, but Granite does plenty of other unique tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is still value in that. In a compact size that you can actually take on a ride, it’ll help prevent significantly over-tightening a bolt on your fancy carbon parts after a trailside readjustment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Real-life impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Design RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit tool roll review, 68g actual weights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_68g-actual-weight-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been playing with this lightweight Granite RocknRoll TQ wrench for several weeks now – including using it as a fidget spinner at my desk – and torque precision is not a selling point in my mind. I’ve used a number of similar beam-style tools. And our Bikerumor crew have handfuls of these low-cost “toque wrenches” in our toolboxes. Several of us are tool geeks, and don’t really take something like this too seriously. But it is “better than nothing”, and nothing is what a lot of cyclists have out on the road, trail, or even parking lot when it comes to torque tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, now with the plethora of carbon parts and sensitive torque settings on our bikes, more portable torque solutions are probably a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, it is accurate? </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Design RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit tool roll review, inaccurate window showing 5Nm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_5Nm-in-a-tiny-window-estimate-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not really. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve had a hard time getting reliable repeatable 4 or 5Nm torque settings when working with the curved white line in the window cutout (checked with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-effetto-mariposa-giustaforza-ii-pro-mechanical-torque-wrench/\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> proper click-style torque wrench). But I was never off by more than 1Nm. Close enough that I tended to err a bit lower and not worry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Design RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit tool roll review, with important extension\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_with-key-extension-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I still benefitted from the speedy ratcheting, though. Bit ratchets speed up a lot of tasks – like installing/removing bottle cages and other accessories in tight spaces. They also offer the ability to easily personalize what 1/4″ bits you prefer. And this one does a great job of giving me the bit I actually need, and the extension that I couldn’t live without. Most, but not all, mini ratchets include some extension. But it is an absolute necessity when adjusting brakes or fine-tuning cockpit setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, my parting thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Design RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit tool roll review, strapped to a mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_strapped-on-a-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RocknRoll TQ is interesting, if not perfect. Nice for day-to-day ratchet use, but not really useful as a torque wrench with anything close to accuracy. Yet, it still is better than torque-ing by feel while out on a ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Design RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit tool roll review, packed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_complete-pack-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Torque Range: 2-10Nm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Torque precision: +/-15%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Size: 133x20x12mm (ratchet tool only) or 152x50x30mm (complete tool roll)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 68g (tool only) or 186g (complete tool roll)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bits included: hex 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, torx T20, T25, phillips PH2 screwdriver</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extra elastic pocket that can fit some spare valve cores, a quick link, or Apple AirTag (<em>not included</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Outer belt-style loop to securely strap the tool roll to body or bike</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Granite RocknRoll TQ – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Design RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit tool roll review, in colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Granite-Design-RocknRoll-TQ-torque-wrench-mini-tool-kit-tool-roll-review_colors-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Granite RocknRoll TQ torque wrench mini-tool kit sells for $60 with a black anodized body.
