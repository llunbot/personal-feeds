While some of its more advanced features are planned for a later update, it’s an easy pick if you want to transfer files between machines or users with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to that the option for backups and antivirus for your files and folders and you’ve got a robust package for as low as 6 Euros a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Folder-View.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Internxt Folder View\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Folder-View.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2034w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Folder-View.jpeg?resize=300%2C172&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Folder-View.jpeg?resize=768%2C440&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Folder-View.jpeg?resize=1200%2C688&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Folder-View.jpeg?resize=1536%2C881&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"688\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Folder View – You can find Internxt in your Finder sidebar</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to stand out in a space such as cloud storage services, but Internxt’s current Star Wars theming offering certainly drew me in (it’s a limited-time theme, but still).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from that set dressing, however, it’s as easy to set up as you can get—make an account, download the desktop version (or use the web app), and you’re away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with just about any rival worth its salt, the Internxt drive can be found in Finder’s sidebar, giving quick access to your files, and ease of use when dragging and dropping to it, while the menu bar has a list of recently uploaded files and a ticker for your storage limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internxt comes with Essential, Premium, and Ultimate payment tiers, with 1TB, 3TB and 5TB respectively, as well as a handy 1GB of cloud storage for free which is ideal if you’re in a pinch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essential kicks off at 3 Euro per month, and includes encryption as standard as well as password protection for files, 2FA, and backup tools, as well as antivirus (more on that shortly).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Premium triples your storage and adds a Device Cleaner and Dark Web Monitor, although those aren’t live at the time of writing. It’ll set you back 6 Euros, while for 9 Euros you can add Mail and Meeting support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These prices are heavily weighted in favour of annual plans, but remain impressively affordable regardless. But, if you’d rather “buy once, cry once”, you can get a Lifetime plan for as little as 135 Euro on the Essential tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Internxt features</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Menu-Bar.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Internxt Menu Bar\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Menu-Bar.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1912w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Menu-Bar.jpeg?resize=300%2C141&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Menu-Bar.jpeg?resize=768%2C360&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Menu-Bar.jpeg?resize=1200%2C562&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Menu-Bar.jpeg?resize=1536%2C720&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"562\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Menu Bar – The app strikes a good balance between having info available and maintaining a clean Menu Bar icon</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the basics, because Internxt absolutely nails the fundamentals of a cloud storage service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dragging files to the folder sidebar or the web app is easy, and I’m constantly impressed by the speed of its uploads. In fact, I’d wager this is one of the fastest-syncing services we’ve tested so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also a great citizen on Mac, with the menu bar icon offering plenty of information and options, without feeling overbearing. It’s a tough balance to strike for some rivals, and offline mode is naturally always welcome, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s security and privacy, with post-quantum encryption to keep your files safe, as well as the option to use password protection, and there’s no file size limit, either.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Web-view.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Internxt Web view\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Web-view.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2756w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Web-view.jpeg?resize=300%2C285&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Web-view.jpeg?resize=768%2C730&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Web-view.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1141&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Web-view.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1460&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Internxt-Web-view.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1947&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1141\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Web View – The web interface for Internxt is slick and easy to navigate, and makes some rivals feel like they move at a snail’s pace</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best features is an Antivirus scanner that works by uploading a file to Internxt to have it checked, and it works on files up to 1GB in size. It can find any malware and remove it, and that’s ideal for peace of mind both in the Cloud and on your local storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Backup function is ideal since you can just point Internxt at a folder and know that it’ll just keep that ticking over in the cloud. Factor in that encryption, which means even a breach at Internxt would ensure your data is secure, and you can see why that would be particularly useful for businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Internxt annoyances</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Internxt may have got the basics down to a tee, but there’s some overhead where we’d like to see it improve in future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, having additional control over managing bandwidth when uploading or downloading would be nice. It’s a small thing, but if you’re on terrible public Wi-Fi, it’s nice to have that added granularity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some rivals also already offer tools like a Dark Web Monitor, but that’s still “coming soon” here. There’s also no file version history, at least for now, but given how Internxt is evolving it’s likely a matter of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy Internxt?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Internxt is one of our favourite cloud storage solutions. It has room to add some new features, but for now it’s so intuitive and clean that it’s hard not to recommend you at least try it.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ca4711e51281e42ff453842550ba742fd34bbc6311be078a54adaefcbf33e447","category":"Apple"}
