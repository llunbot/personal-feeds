Provenance is a frontend for many existing emulators, and it would allow iPhone and Apple TV users to emulate games released for a <a href=\"https://wiki.provenance-emu.com/info/supported-systems\">wide variety of classic game consoles</a>, including the original PlayStation, GameCube, Wii, SEGA Genesis, Atari 2600, and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Provenance-Emulator.jpeg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1081\" />\r<br />\nApple has so far approved emulators on the App Store for older Nintendo consoles <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emu64-xl/id6483251916\">and the Commodore 64</a>. For example, Riley Testut's popular <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/\">Delta emulator is now in the App Store</a> in many countries, and it can emulate games released for the Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Nintendo 64, and Nintendo DS. Provenance would bring the first Sony, SEGA, and Atari emulators to the App Store if approved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProvenance has been in development since 2016, and it can already be sideloaded on the iPhone and the Apple TV outside of the App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple updated its App Review Guidelines earlier this month to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/\">allow \"retro game console emulator apps\"</a> on the App Store for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other devices. Earlier this week, Apple told us that emulators that can load games (ROMs) are permitted on the App Store, so long as the apps are emulating \"retro console games\" only. It is unclear if Apple will consider consoles like the GameCube and Wii to be \"retro.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile a U.S. court <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp.\">ruled</a> that emulators are legal, downloading copyrighted ROMs is typically against the law in the country. On its <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55888/~/intellectual-property-%26-piracy-faq\">customer support website</a> for the U.S., Nintendo says that downloading pirated copies of its games is illegal. A wide collection of public-domain <a href=\"https://hh.gbdev.io/\">\"homebrew\" games</a> are available to play legally.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emulator/\">Emulator</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/ps1-gamecube-wii-emulator-coming-to-app-store/\">PlayStation, GameCube, Wii, and SEGA Emulator for iPhone and Apple TV Coming to App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/playstation-gamecube-wii-and-sega-emulator-for-iphone-and-apple-tv-coming-to-app-store.2424504/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"627b682e99becef104425c107f93d3728b11e6477c945621ce88885123490685","category":"Apple"}
