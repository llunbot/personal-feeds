{"title":"iFixit's Full 16-Inch MacBook Pro Video Teardown Highlights Internal Design Changes","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/29/ifixit-macbook-pro-full-teardown/","date":1635535428000,"content":"iFixit earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-battery-pull-tabs/\">posted a teaser</a> of its MacBook Pro teardown, and now, the site is back with a full video that gives us a clear look at the components inside the new MacBook Pro models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nAs iFixit mentioned in its first article, it's easier to get into a MacBook Pro than it was before because Apple is no longer gluing the batteries in place. Instead, there are adhesive pull tabs that make battery replacement more streamlined. Repairs aren't simple, though, because there's the speaker system to deal with near the battery, and the adhesive tabs for the two main battery cells can only be accessed by removing the trackpad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe fans are bigger than the fans that were in the prior-generation machine, and there's more space for the speaker system due to the thicker chassis. There's a 99.6Wh battery in the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is a bit smaller than the battery in the prior-generation model. With efficiency improvements introduced with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Pro and Max chips, battery life is much improved.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's an updated display cable design that gives them more slack when the display is opened and closed, which should prevent the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/flexgate-macbook-pro-display-issue/\">Flexgate</a>\" issues that have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/flexgate-macbook-pro-display-issue/\">plagued older MacBook Pro models</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe three USB-C ports, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> port, and the headphone jack are modular for simple repairs, but the HDMI port and the SD card slot are soldered in place on the logic board. Memory and storage are integrated and not user replaceable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll in all, iFixit gave the MacBook Pro a repair score of 4/10 because of the use of pentalobe screws, the difficulty removing the top cover, and issues with repairing features like the fingerprint sensor and the display, which lose functionality with component swaps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niFixit also plans to do a <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown\">full written teardown</a> of the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which it says is very similar to the 16-inch machine. That teardown will be updated later.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/29/ifixit-macbook-pro-full-teardown/\">iFixit's Full 16-Inch MacBook Pro Video Teardown Highlights Internal Design Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixits-full-16-inch-macbook-pro-video-teardown-highlights-internal-design-changes.2320613/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=be9TOQP0ghk:Uqmn-X8XB70:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=be9TOQP0ghk:Uqmn-X8XB70:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/be9TOQP0ghk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b39c29ca21cab054a0f203eb71998859f49255ae7232ef097d50a66faac123ed","category":"Apple"}
