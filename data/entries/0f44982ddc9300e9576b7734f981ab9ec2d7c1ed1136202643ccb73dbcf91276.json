The company emailed users of Android TV to say that the \"Google Play Movies &amp; TV app will no longer be available on your Android TV device from 05 October 2023. You can continue to buy or rent movies directly through the Shop tab on your Android TV.\"</p>\n<p>Play Movies has been going through a slow death as Google shuffles around its media content. The smartphone Play Movies app became \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/google-tv-launches-on-ios-as-a-replacement-for-google-play-movies-tv/\">Google TV</a>\" in 2022, and that same year the Play Store app <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/google-will-stop-selling-movies-and-tv-shows-through-the-play-store/\">was stripped</a> of movie and TV sales. On third-party smart TVs (this is a different category than today's Android TV announcement) the app was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/google-is-killing-google-play-movies-tv-on-smart-tvs/\">killed off</a> in 2021. On Android TV the new \"Shop\" tab seems to just be an OS-integrated Google TV content store.</p>\n<p>If you think this sounds confusing you're not alone. Google's <a href=\"https://support.google.com/androidtv/answer/13627550?hl=en&amp;sjid=18375249328446876764-AP&amp;utm_source=MSAcomm&amp;utm_medium=email+&amp;utm_campaign=GPMAppDeprecation&amp;utm_id=g20274179\">support page</a> reflects the absolutely ridiculous state of Google's video apps, instructing users that \"in Your Library, you can find content that you bought from: Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Android TV, Google TV.\" How any normal person is supposed to understand that pile of Google media brands, and how it works across phones, the web, and various smart TV OSes, is beyond me.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965819#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965819&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0f44982ddc9300e9576b7734f981ab9ec2d7c1ed1136202643ccb73dbcf91276","category":"Tech"}
