The table below presents a comparison of the core configurations and GPU specifications for the different variants of the ‌M1‌ and ‌M2‌ chips:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>(Standard)</th>\r<br />\n <th>Pro</th>\r<br />\n <th>Max</th>\r<br />\n <th>Ultra</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌M1‌</th>\r<br />\n <td>4 high-performance cores\r<br />\n4 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n7- or 8-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>6 or 8 high-performance cores\r<br />\n2 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n14- or 16-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>8 high-performance cores\r<br />\n2 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n24- or 32-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>16 high-performance cores\r<br />\n4 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n48- or 64-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌M2‌</th>\r<br />\n <td>4 high-performance cores\r<br />\n4 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n8- or 10-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>6 or 8 high-performance cores\r<br />\n4 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n16- or 19-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>8 high-performance cores\r<br />\n4 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n30- or 38-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>16 high-performance cores\r<br />\n8 energy-efficient cores\r<br />\n60- or 76-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDeciding how many CPU cores you need depends on the specific tasks and workflows you intend to perform on your Mac. For example, if you primarily engage in basic tasks like web browsing, document editing, and media consumption, an eight-core chip should suffice. On the other hand, if you work with demanding workloads like software development, opting for a higher core count can provide significant performance benefits. Similarly, graphics-intense workflows like video editing, 3D modeling, or gaming will benefit from additional GPU cores.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Benchmarks</h3>\r<br />\nComputer benchmark scores are standardized measurements that evaluate the performance of chips, providing a numerical representation for comparing capabilities and assessing performance against industry standards. The data on this chart is calculated from Geekbench 6 <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks\">results users uploaded to Geekbench</a>. Geekbench 6 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 2,500 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-12700 performing the same task).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe below Geekbench 6 scores show the range from the lowest specification chip in the least powerful Mac to the highest specification chip in the most powerful Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>(Standard)</th>\r<br />\n <th>Pro</th>\r<br />\n <th>Max</th>\r<br />\n <th>Ultra</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌M1‌</th>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: 2,324–2,346\r<br />\nMulti-Core: 8,204–8,368\r<br />\nMetal: 31,549</td>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: 2,359–2,371\r<br />\nMulti-Core: 10,276–12,132\r<br />\nMetal: 64,096</td>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: 2,369–2,397\r<br />\nMulti-Core: 12,108–12,369\r<br />\nMetal: 108,584</td>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: 2,381\r<br />\nMulti-Core: 17,677\r<br />\nMetal: 152,706</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌M2‌</th>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: 2,561–2,625\r<br />\nMulti-Core: 9,583–9,687\r<br />\nMetal: 42,573</td>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: 2,633–2,647\r<br />\nMulti-Core: 12,028–14,203\r<br />\nMetal: 76,304</td>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: 2,730–\r<br />\nMulti-Core: 14,405–\r<br />\nMetal: 131,408</td>\r<br />\n <td>Single-Core: \r<br />\nMulti-Core: \r<br />\nMetal: 208,028</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the ‌M1‌ and ‌M2‌ chips demonstrate performance improvements in single-core and multi-core tasks as you move from the base to the Ultra variants, with the ‌M2‌ chip showcasing even higher performance across the board. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that benchmarks do not tell the whole story. Benchmarks focus on specific tasks and synthetic workloads, and do not always accurately capture real-world usage scenarios and variations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Unified Memory</h3>\r<br />\nApple silicon chips have a unified memory architecture, meaning that the RAM is tied directly to the processor for maximum speed and efficiency. This means that the chip you choose determines what memory option are available, and it is not upgradable at a later date. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>(Standard)</th>\r<br />\n <th>Pro</th>\r<br />\n <th>Max</th>\r<br />\n <th>Ultra</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌M1‌</th>\r<br />\n <td>8GB\r<br />\n16GB</td>\r<br />\n <td>16GB\r<br />\n32GB</td>\r<br />\n <td>32GB\r<br />\n64GB</td>\r<br />\n <td>64GB\r<br />\n128GB</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌M2‌</th>\r<br />\n <td>8GB\r<br />\n16GB\r<br />\n24GB</td>\r<br />\n <td>16GB\r<br />\n32GB</td>\r<br />\n <td>32GB\r<br />\n64GB\r<br />\n96GB</td>\r<br />\n <td>64GB\r<br />\n128GB\r<br />\n192GB</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDeciding how much RAM you need depends on your specific tasks and usage patterns. 8GB should be enough for most users, but upgrading to 16GB or 24GB could be sensible for users with more intense multitasking requirements. Amounts of memory beyond 32GB are generally reserved for seriously demanding workflows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\r<br />\nOverall, if you are new to Apple silicon and are still not sure which chip to buy, use the following rationale:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Buy M1 or M2 if...</strong> you need a good balance of price, performance, and battery life and have normal day-to-day computing requirements.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Buy M1 Pro or M2 Pro if...</strong> you need a performance-focused chip for slightly more intense workflows.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Buy M1 Max or M2 Max if...</strong> you need additional graphics performance for working with images, videos, graphic design, or games.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Buy M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra if...</strong> you need the best possible overall performance for extremely intense professional workflows.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is generally not worth upgrading from any of the individual ‌M1‌ chips to their direct successors and it may be better to wait for Apple to launch the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a> series of chips. Apple has not yet released any M3-series chips, but the company is rumored to launch the ‌M3‌ chip toward the end of 2023. It is expected to be Apple's first chip based on TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> process, a significantly smaller node, which should lead to major performance and efficiency improvements over the ‌M1‌ and ‌M2‌ chips that are currently on offer.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/\">Apple Silicon Buyer's Guide: All the Differences Explained</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-buyers-guide-all-the-differences-explained.2395320/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f4098f4fd8ab62dfbd6acbb62bccb30995111de9f0ffc22640de3634a17d657","category":"Apple"}
