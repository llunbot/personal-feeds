Originally, the scheme was only open at the physical ticket windows where points could be used to buy train tickets, but the mobile app now supports the feature, too. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/taiwan/\">Taiwan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/06/taiwan-railways-administration-apple-pay/\">Taiwan Railways Administration Announces Apple Pay Support for E-Tickets</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/taiwan-railways-administration-announces-apple-pay-support-for-e-tickets.2309835/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Z9fa97l7O1c:fuTgy5pQFmE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Z9fa97l7O1c:fuTgy5pQFmE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Z9fa97l7O1c\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e536afb0da7fc819c72962603687e0195c15f9b1096d842f46661e9ce0ba3415","category":"Apple"}
