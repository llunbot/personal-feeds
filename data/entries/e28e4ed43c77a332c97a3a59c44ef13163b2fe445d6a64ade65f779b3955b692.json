Customers who sought testing from LabElite—sometimes for clearance to travel or have contact with vulnerable people—received either no results or results indicating they were negative for the deadly virus.</p>\n<p>The scam, which ran from around February 2021 to about February 2022, made over $83 million total in fraudulent payments from the federal government's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which covered the cost of COVID-19 testing for people without insurance during the height of the pandemic. Local media coverage indicated that people who sought testing at LabElite were discouraged from providing health insurance information.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/covid-fraudster-pleads-guilty-faces-20-years-for-role-in-83m-testing-scam/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/covid-fraudster-pleads-guilty-faces-20-years-for-role-in-83m-testing-scam/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e28e4ed43c77a332c97a3a59c44ef13163b2fe445d6a64ade65f779b3955b692","category":"Tech"}
