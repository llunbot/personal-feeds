Beeper has kept revising its approach, and its newest method—involving regular access to a physical Mac—suggests why the company has added a political component to its efforts.</p>\n<p>Beeper started pushing back after its initial blockage, both through continued development and through media and political messaging. After a second, if smaller, Apple crackdown, co-founder Eric Migicovsky <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeJs0XOvFrw\">welcomed <em>CBS Mornings</em> into his garage</a>, where he advanced his argument that Beeper was turning grossly insecure SMS messages between iPhone and Android users into secure, end-to-end encrypted chats.

The move follows, and seems to echo, similar efforts by EU regulators to open up iMessage, which have been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/12/imessage-will-reportedly-dodge-eu-regulations-wont-have-to-open-up/\">stalled so far</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992070#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992070&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e3c6be1d6d5ec8325d12aeb2a73a0fbc47e7c293383bea3204a32accd51f686d","category":"Tech"}
