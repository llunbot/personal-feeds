{"title":"Next year’s iPhone could feature a thin, redesigned ultra high-end model","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2337606/the-2025-iphone-could-feature-a-thin-redesigned-ultra-high-end-model.html","date":1715969880000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem like every year the next big iPhone update is just a year away, but a new rumor claims that this time it might actually be true. A new report from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025&amp;xcust=1-1-2337606-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">The Information</a> (subscription required) says that Apple is working on a new version of the iPhone for 2025 that will be sold as a higher-end version above Pro Max model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this new iPhone won’t simply be a larger version of the Pro Max. In fact, it might not be a Pro model at all. The Information reports that the new iPhone’s most defining characteristic will be its redesigned body with a new ultra-thin case, smaller Dynamic Island, and centered rear camera, giving this iPhone an obvious visual difference from the other models in the lineup. The size of the display may fall between the Pro and Pro Max models, the first time Apple didn’t place a premium on the largest model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new thin iPhone will also likely have an A19 Pro chip and appears to replace the iPhone Plus, even though it will be more expensive than the iPhone Pro Max. Apple has been rumored to be releasing a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1503167/iphone-15-ultra-pro-max-size-price.html\">higher-end iPhone</a> for years, but it was reported that it would be an ultra-high-end model with a larger screen. This model appears to be a departure from that plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears as though thin is back in style in Cupertino. Apple just unveiled the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">M4 iPad Pro</a> with a thickness of 5.3mm, the thinnest device Apple has ever made. The iPhone 16 Plus has a thickness of 7.8mm compared to the M2 iPad Pro, which had was 6.4mm depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Information’s report comes after analyst Jeff Pu <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324602/iphone-17-slim-24mp-front-camera-2025.html\">wrote in an investor note</a> earlier this month about a similar new iPhone model. Pu said the iPhone 17 and 17 “Slim” will have 8GB of RAM with either the A18 or A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will have an A19 Pro with 12GB of RAM. However, the Information’s report paints a picture of a higher-end model than Pu’s rumor. Also chiming in on the rumor is Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants, who says <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://x.com/dsccross/status/1787509002668286193&amp;xcust=1-1-2337606-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the new model will have a 6.5-inch display</a>.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1ab7115bec24faddbc01f92fe7652af79d8c1da0a813f0daf278d4c8974eadc4","category":"Apple"}
