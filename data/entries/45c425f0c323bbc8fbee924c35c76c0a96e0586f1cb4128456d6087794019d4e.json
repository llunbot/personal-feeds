Tour de France Femmes winners, Classics titans and hopeful young guns have swapped team colours for 2025. Two of the biggest names in the sport in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/demi-vollering\" target=\"_blank\">Demi Vollering</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-longo-borghini-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Elisa Longo Borghini</a> have moved this off-season. With the end of the UCI’s new two-year promotion and relegation cycle in sight at the end of next year, this winter provides a last chance saloon for the lower-table teams to change their fortunes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the transfers have mostly trickled in, let’s draw some early conclusions and weigh up each Women’s WorldTour team’s transfer season. Each squad will receive a critical ranking and a star signing. After all that, we’ll crown one team as our transfer window winners.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>AG Insurance-Soudal</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T151133.195.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We kick off our list with a team that shouldn’t feel any anxiety about the upcoming relegation battle, AG Insurance-Soudal. The women’s spin-off from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel’s </a>Soudal-QuickStep have made a couple of notable signings to strengthen their upward trajectory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, Australian Alex Manly is a solid addition. She’s bagged stages at the Tour of Scandinavia and the Tour Down Under in the past and is hungry to emulate some of that form at her new team. Urška Žigart, the partner of Tadej Pogacar, is another signing from Liv-AlUla-Jayco that could make headway at the Belgian outfit. Gladys Verhulst-Wild, the first rider to ever wear the polka-dot jersey at the Tour de France Femmes, is another WorldTour pro swapping homes for 2025. These three should slot into the current set-up without much hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two Belgians round out their transfer window in the shape of former basketball player Fauve Bastiaenssen and reigning Belgian gravel champion Alana Castrique. Still fairly unknown on the road, these two will be regarded more as development projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a brief stint at the team, Kiwi GC prospect Ally Wollaston is leaving AG Insurance for FDJ-Suez. Also leaving are Maaike Boogaard and Maud Rijnbeek, both bound for VolkerWessels, who might be in contention for WorldTour promotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a whole, these signings should really support the team’s chances for the next twelve months, particularly in the name of breakaways and support for mountain leaders Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio and Justine Ghekiere. The departing riders shouldn’t dampen their spirits for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Alex Manly </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 5/10</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> this year, Canyon-SRAM have big ambitions for 2025. The team will soon be known by the name Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto. Apparently it’s a good period for cryptobros, so Zondacrypto might be here to stay. With them on board, the German squad have shelled out a few extra bitcoins and landed some big name transfers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig is the biggest incomer. I’m not quite sure how she’ll link up with Niewiadoma on the road given the similarities between the two in the Classics, however her pedigree in punchy finales shouldn’t be overlooked. I suspect the bubbly Dane will add an extra weapon into Canyon-SRAM’s GC arsenal at the Tour next year, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">particularly during the opening Breton stages</a>. With rival teams making big reinforcements this winter, this is Canyon-SRAM’s attempt to stay on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, prolific Giro sprinter Chiara Consonni will slot into their cobbled Classic lineup. Another top drawer transfer is Unbound winner Rosa Klöser, who will join the squad’s ranks next year. After stumbling into cycling somewhat by accident while living in Copenhagen, Klöser will add an intriguing figure into the Canyon-SRAM setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New FDJ-Suez signing Elise Chabbey will be a big loss, but I think the additions made mark a real bullishness to remain at the top in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ceratizit-WNT</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112353.825.png 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a strange transfer window for Ceratizit-WNT. Given that the team missed the initial UCI paperwork deadline just over a month ago, a little-known clause was triggered allowing riders to leave the team before the agreed end date of their contract. Cédrine Kerbaol must have read the small-print because she crept her way out a year early, deciding to put her faith in EF-Cannondale-Oatly next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The squad’s other big points scorer Marta Lach is also out the door, she’s secured a contract at SD Worx-ProTime after a stellar season, and UCI top 50 rider Kathrin Schweinberger is off too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these big-name exits, Ceratizit have called upon the expertise of young riders to help fill the gap. 21-year-old Sara Fiorin from the UAE Team ADQ development programme looks particularly promising in the sprints. Likewise, 22-year-old Czech sprinter Kristýna Burlová has shown some glimpses of hope while at the now-defunct Lifeplus-Wahoo squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WorldTour relegation looking like a real possibility, Ceratizit-WNT appear to be a sinking ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Kristýna Burlová</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 3/10</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-970x327.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-970x327.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-300x101.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-768x259.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-1536x517.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-2048x689.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-750x252.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-2-1140x384.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>FDJ-Suez</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112823.346-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112823.346-970x647.png 970w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112823.346-300x200.png 300w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112823.346-768x512.png 768w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112823.346-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T112823.346.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FDJ-Suez have recruited the best women’s cyclist about at the moment, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/demi-vollering\" target=\"_blank\">Demi Vollering</a>, after she finally parted ways with SD Worx following a troublesome year with the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Vollering will lead FDJ-Suez’s stage racing objectives next year. The reigning Vuelta champion already discussed her content at her new home, describing it as a warmer place than SD Worx. On top of that, the 2023 Tour winner has also declared her aspirations of winning the yellow jersey on a French team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In anticipation of Vollering’s arrival, the French squad have enlisted the support of two top tier riders: Elise Chabbey and Juliette Labous. Swiss rider Chabbey has the right characteristics to effortlessly slot into the role of <em>domestique de luxe</em>. Labous, on the other hand, is more experienced as a GC leader in her own right. A former Giro podium finisher herself, it’ll be interesting to see how FDJ-Suez utilise the ex-DSM rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other riders are also on their way in, but Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig and Marta Cavalli’s departures mark the end of an era for the team. Now with Vollering on their books, FDJ-Suez will surely evolve into one of the teams to beat in 2025. They’ve wrangled quite the squad during the summer, now boasting one of the most feared lineups in the mountains and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Demi Vollering</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 9/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fenix-Deceuninck</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/file-19.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fenix-Deceuninck had a remarkable 2024 Tour de France Femmes.

Teenage sensation Xaydee Van Sinaey joins the squad from Fenix-Deceuninck’s in-house development squad. The 19-year-old Belgian is currently the only rider to have formally announced her transfer to the team for next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of departures, it’s thin on the ground in terms of news. That’s more to do with contract renewals – we’re still to hear about the future of the likes of cyclocross star Sanne Cant, for example. What we do know is that Greta Marturano is off to UAE Team ADQ next year. She’s a decent <em>puncheur</em>, but this shouldn’t really affect the destiny of Pauliene Rooijakkers next year if she has aspirations of repeating her Tour de France Femmes podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The squad is cross-discipline focussed, so we might hear more news as the cyclocross season develops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing:</strong> Xaydee van Sinaey </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 2/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Human Powered Health</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T113743.239.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Human Powered Health managed to survive 2024 despite shutting up their men’s team at the end of 2023.

The Dutch rider snuck into the top 20 of the UCI rankings and bagged three stage race podiums in 2024.

The most notable is Audrey Cordon Ragot, who has retired. Losing young Kiwi Henrietta Christie is another blow for the team.

The Kiwi was sometimes held back at SD Worx, but the Giro stage winner will now have the chance to lead her own team at a Grand Tour next year. As for the fourth and final recruit Riejanne Markus, Lidl-Trek have picked up another versatile rider capable of towing the line between leadership and domestique duties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it’s been a very successful transfer window for Lidl-Trek. These are four big names that will all comfortably slot into the team set-up no doubt. Yes, Longo Borghini has left a bit of a vacuum, but that might allow younger riders like Shirin van Anrooij and new recruit Fisher-Black to stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Niamh Fisher-Black</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 8/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liv-AlUla-Jayco</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T114805.270.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s transfer window hasn’t been quite so favourable for Liv-AlUla-Jayco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Australian squad are losing three big names in the form of Ingvild Gåskjenn, Alex Manly and Urška Žigart.

With Ferguson tipped to be the next big thing, I see this year’s transfer window as a success all things considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Marlen Reusser</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Roland</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T115230.220.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Possibly the most forgettable team on the Women’s WorldTour, Roland are in serious jeopardy at the end of the Women’s WorldTour relegation cycle next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lord knows what’s happening at Roland HQ.

href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\">Team DSM-Firmenich-PostNL</a> have been one of the top scorers in the Women’s WorldTour. They’ve secured some strong GC results, sprint victories and Classic triumphs over the past couple of seasons. That said, an influential figure is parting ways with the squad in Juliette Labous, and fellow Frenchwoman Eglantine Rayer is also heading across to FDJ-Suez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Labous out, this leaves room for one headline rider to come in. For that, there’s Marta Cavalli. The Italian, at her best, is one of the strongest climbers<em> </em>in the bunch, having previously won Amstel Gold and Flèche Wallonne. Some sources have reported that this transfer was leveraged as part of the deal for Labous. This is fair on paper, however Cavalli has been way off her former glory for around two years. This is through no fault of her own, she was victim to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-andre-drege\" target=\"_blank\">two major crashes</a> that have left her on a long road to recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of young blood, Ella Heremans is flying across to DSM from AG Insurance’s development structure. Likewise, Canadian youngster and Volta a Portugal stage winner Mara Roldan is joining the team. She’ll become the first rider form the northerly territory of Yukon to ride on the WorldTour level of professional cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Marta Cavalli</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 5/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Team SD Worx-Protime</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/20240815TDFFAZ1066-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a year of highs and lows for SD Worx-Protime. Despite convincingly topping the UCI team rankings – with a Paris-Roubaix victory and three Grand Tour podiums along the way – the Dutch superteam was characterised by structural squabbles and a high-proifle fall-out with star rider<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/demi-vollering\" target=\"_blank\"> Demi Vollering.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back of this, they’re are parting ways with two of their marquee riders: Demi Vollering and Marlen Reusser. As for the former, it was long reported that Vollering would be heading elsewhere. Otherwise, 2024 marks the end of the road for Marlen Reusser at SD Worx. This is a more surprising move, but it’ll leave some big shoes to be filled in the Classics. To add, Niamh Fisher-Black is also off SD Worx’s books, leaving another gap in the Dutch squad’s Grand Tour lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures, however. Three years after initially retiring at the end of the 2021 season,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/anna-van-der-breggen-comeback\" target=\"_blank\"> Anna van der Breggen</a> will make her return to pro cycling. A former Giro champion, Monument star and rainbow jersey winner, Van der Breggen should slot into a leader’s rol, although we have no idea where her form is at. She’s spent the previous couple of years as a <em>directuer sportif</em>, so we’re really going into this one blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining Van der Breggen in 2025 are Mikayla Harvey and Marta Lach. They add another two decent climbers into the squad’s roster. I will say, however, that SD Worx have definitely lost more than they’ve gained. This could be a real step down from where they were a couple of seasons ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Anna van der Breggen (if that counts)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 4/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Team Visma-Lease a Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2154751585-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Piotr Staron/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> are betting on youth. They’ve enlisted two teenagers in the form of Tour de l’Avenir winner Marion Bunel and World Road Championship medallist Viktória Chladoňová. These are two of the most hotly tipped youngsters in women’s cycling at the moment and Visma have played a blinder by sealing both of their contracts. Bunel, in particular, is a promising rider in the GC. She reached the top 20 of the Tour de France Femmes at the age of 19. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sticking with French riders, Visma have signed Pauline Ferrand-Prévot. The Olympic MTB champion claimed hefty wins on the road during her rampant 2014 season, which included a win at Flèche Wallonne and a World Road Championship. In anticipation of her comeback road season, she’s shared some big ambitions in regard to the Tour de France. Who knows whether she’ll be at yellow jersey level after her stint as Ineos’s one-woman show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These young recruits and the PR factor of Ferrand-Prévot’s return have provided a real gilmmer of hope in this transfer window, somewhat overshadowing the departures of Riejanne Markus and Anna Henderson. We shouldn’t underestimate the importance of locking Bunel and Chladoňová down on multi-year deals, however – that should be seen as a real transfer victory for the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Pauline Ferrand-Prévot</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 8/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>UAE Team ADQ</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T115503.883.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>UAE Team ADQ have struggled to live up to the dizzying successes of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\"> the men’s team</a>. They’ve never taken a Grand Tour or a Monument. However, this could change soon with the recruitment of one key signing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team have enlisted Elisa Longo Borghini as their new leader. The Italian is one of the most decorated riders in the bunch. In 2024 alone, she won the Tour of Flanders and the Giro d’Italia Women. In the past she’s also demonstrated that she is able to balance her top-tier abilities in the cobbled Classics as well as stage racing. This might be the big transfer required to change UAE Team ADQ’s fortunes at the Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UAE Team ADQ have called upon Longo Borghini’s old Lidl-Trek teammates for some more reinforcements. 22-year-old Elynor Bäckstedt will look to continue her progression while time-trialist Brodie Chapman adds another domestique option for Longo Borghini’s new bosses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youth sensation, and new UAE signing, Sofie van Rooijen managed to sneak into the top 25 of the UCI rankings this year. She won four lower division Classics as well as the under-23 title at the European Road Championships this autumn. She’s demonstrated some fast legs in the sprints, so expect to see her name towards the top ten of Grand Tours over the following two seasons with UAE Team ADQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these big names now on their books, some space had to be cleared. Slovenian veteran Eugenia Bujak is leaving UAE Team ADQ in favour of Cofidis. Elsewhere, the Giro stage machine Chiara Consonni is off to potentially greener pastures. Overall, the incomers should help steer UAE Team ADQ towards future glory. Longo Borghini might not have the same support here as her previous team, but she’s strong enough to still pull off at least one A-list victory next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Elisa Longo Borghini</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Uno X Mobility</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-27T145352.699.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another team that could be facing relegation at the end of 2025, Uno X Mobility will be in need of some big changes in order to stay in the top division.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingvild Gåskjenn leads the list of new signings. The Norwegian had an impressive spring underpinned by a podium finish at Amstel Gold. A handful of young Scandinavians are also heading into Uno X: Mia Gjertsen, Kamilla Aasebø and Alberte Greve. Outside of the Scandinavian realm, <br />Swiss youngster Linda Zanetti joins from Hujman Powered Health. She’s shown some signs of greatness with stage victories at the under-23 level during 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Track star Julie Norman Leth has retired from pro cycling, as has former British time-trial champ Joss Lowden. Amalie Diderikse leads the brief list of departing riders. Despite her 2016 rainbow jersey, the Dane hasn’t quite lived up to expectations in recent years. She’ll be hoping to refind some of that promise at her new team Cofidis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Star signing: </strong>Ingvild Gåskjenn</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transfer rating:</strong> 3/10</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cyclist’s transfer window winners: FDJ-Suez</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/20220420FWF1028-A.S.O._Romain_Laurent-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Romain Laurent</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We might be witnessing the birth of a new superteam with FDJ-Suez. Vollering, Chabbey, Muzic and Labous all on one team? That’s mind-blowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The French squad have enlisted some of the biggest names in the sport and I’m not just referring to Demi Vollering. Elise Chabbey is going to be a stellar domestique, there’s no doubt about it. I can also see Évita Muzic slotting into a Sepp Kuss-style role with ease. Don’t be surprised as well if Juliette Labous finds a second wind at FDJ and becomes a podium finisher at next year’s Grand Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feels like FDJ-Suez are finally catching on to what UAE Team Emirates and Visma-Lease a Bike are doing in the men’s WorldTour and trying to replicate it here. It all makes sense to me. They’re now in the big time and in with a real chance of winning not one, not two, but maybe three Grand Tours in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 Tour de France Femmes is theirs to lose.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-transfers-2025-winners-and-losers\">Rating every men’s WorldTour team’s transfer window</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-50-best-mens-road-cyclists-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 50 best men’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-cycling-transfers-2024-2025\">The 8 most impactful pro cycling transfers this season</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\">The top 50 women’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">Pro cycling transfers 2024/2025: Elisa Longo Borghini finally confirms move to UAE Team ADQ, Kasper Asgreen signs for EF and Tom Pidcock rumoured to join second-division Q36.5</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/womens-transfers-winners-and-losers\">Rating every women’s WorldTour team’s 2024/25 transfer window</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"45c425f0c323bbc8fbee924c35c76c0a96e0586f1cb4128456d6087794019d4e","category":"Cycling"}
