The feature is available on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, excluding Apple Watch SE models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMasimo has accused Apple of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-masimo-legal-battle/\">stealing trade secrets and poaching employees</a> to develop its blood oxygen sensing functionality. Last month, Masimo said it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/masimo-ceo-on-apple-watch-ban/\">open to settlement talks</a>, but Apple had reportedly not expressed any interest at the time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn December, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/\">briefly paused sales</a> of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 across its U.S. retail stores and online store. After appealing the ITC's ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/\">granted a temporary stay</a>, leading to the ban being paused and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-online/\">sales resuming</a> for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-watch-import-ban-software-fix/\">working on software changes</a> to address the alleged patent infringement, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is expected to rule on these changes later this week. However, Masimo believes that the Apple Watch's hardware design will have to change to become compliant, and the ITC also expressed skepticism.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"To the extent Apple relies on the soon-expected ruling from Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") as to whether certain redesigned Apple Watches infringe the Asserted Patents, those arguments are, at best, misplaced,\" ITC lawyers said in today's filing. \"A favorable ruling to Apple has no bearing on Apple's alleged likelihood of success on the merits as to any raised issue, and instead would undermine Apple's 'irreparable harm' argument.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have shared the ITC's full response <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/698059705/ITC-Opposition-to-Motion-for-Stay-in-Apple-Masimo-Case\">as a PDF</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/\">Masimo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/itc-opposes-apple-watch-sales-ban-pause/\">ITC Wants Apple Watch Sales Ban Reinstated: 'Apple Presents a Weak and Unconvincing Case'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/itc-wants-apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated-apple-presents-a-weak-and-unconvincing-case.2416020/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17ab158a3e98a23f589f2078efea092192630a5ae754075fe7e9a1a8cfa751f2","category":"Apple"}
