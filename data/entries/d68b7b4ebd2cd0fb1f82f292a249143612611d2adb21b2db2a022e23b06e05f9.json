All of this comes to mind when you think of Girona and we are so excited at Moots to now have a premier partner in this area showcasing a full range of our bikes. Nestled in the mountains just a short drive from Girona near a beautiful small village called Besalu sits the beautiful luxury estate that is the home base for Artu Club.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/img_0890/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0890.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0890.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0890-300x225.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/dsc05840/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05840.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05840.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05840-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/img_0931/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0931.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0931.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0931-300x225.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n\n<p>The property itself is named Can Terrades and the team at Artu spared no expense in the restoration of this amazing estate. The location itself is incredible as you arrive, situated within a 160 acre property surrounded by vines, woodland and hills. The moment you arrive and walk around this place it is clear that it is a sanctuary as much as a multi-sports hub. And of course, as you make your way around the property for a tour, you’ll be more than excited to see over a dozen beautiful Moots bicycles in all styles there for guests to use and explore the mountain, road and gravel routes right out the door. Yet we didn’t go to Artu just to hang out in a beautiful place, we came to ride and have now made two trips in the past couple of years. We’ve had the pleasure to share these experiences<br />\nwith friends, customers, dealers and family and have really gotten to know the property and the team at Artu well. And it is easy to say that they are a special group and perfect Moots ambassadors who understand what we are all about and share our passion for riding. We’re proud to showcase them as the premier spot in Europe where guests can go and relax, ride and maybe even try a Moots for the very first time. Should you choose to buy your own Moots from Artu, there are special benefits for you as a guest at their property and we know that might be just the push some need.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/dsc05702/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05702.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05702.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05702-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/dsc06222/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC06222.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC06222.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC06222-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/dsc05965/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05965.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05965.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC05965-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n\n<p><strong>Gravel Riding</strong><br />\nThe property is at the end of a gravel road, so the dirt is right out the door. We had a blast exploring all the small farm roads and dirt tracks around the area. The Service Course, a well known bike shop based in Girona, even hosts an annual gravel race with a route that comes right by Can Terrades and all of us were able to participate in that event wh</p>\n<p>ile visiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Road Riding</strong><br />\nGirona’s roads and climbs have become very well known in the cycling world and they are all easily accessible from the property. One of the hardest climbs you’ll find is just up the road, where you’ll climb 12 miles and 3,800 feet to get to the top of El Mont and find a beautiful castle with coffee and snacks. Our favorite road ride was a one way trip to this beautiful little village named Cadeques, where Salvador Dali lived and painted. This route takes you through small towns and scenic roads, culminating with an incredible descent to town with views of the ocean that will blow your mind. On this particular ride, we finished at a seafood restaurant by the ocean and had an amazing post ride meal together.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/img_0955/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0955.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0955.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0955-300x225.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/img_0894/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0894.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0894.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0894-300x225.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/an-october-adventure-moots-artu/img_9655/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_9655.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_9655.jpg 640w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_9655-300x225.jpg 300w\" /></a>\n\n<p><strong>An October Adventure</strong></p>\n<p>You can see why we’re excited about this partnership at Moots. It really is special to have such great friends at the Artu Club and we’ve had such a wonderful time these past two years that we want to extend the invitation to a broader group of Moots customers and fans. As such, we are officially hosting a Moots trip from October 20 to the 26th this year. This is a boutique estate with very limited capacity and only 10 spots are available. You can book either a private room or bring a friend and share a room. Prices range from $2,650 per person for a shared and cozy room to $4,150 for a single luxury room. Whatever you choose, be quick about it and clear your calendar and book your flights as you’re not going to want to miss what will be an amazing experience. We look forward to seeing you there.</p>\n<p>We’ll have 6 days of riding ranging in distances with at least one to two long days of 60-80 miles. Surface will be primarily road with some gravel mixed in as well. Tires of 32-35 recommended. If you want to use one of the Moots at Artu, please let us know so we can reserve the bike for you.
