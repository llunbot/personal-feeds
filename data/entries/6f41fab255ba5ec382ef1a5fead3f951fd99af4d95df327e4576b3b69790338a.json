Designed for proper gravity riding and DH racing, the Time Xysto is a lightweight but large platform clipless pedal with 5 asymmetric traction pins per side for plenty of grip, whether clipped in or not. It’s the next evolution of Time’s long-running Speciale, with the same trusted ATAC adjustable retention, now just with a bigger platform and more pins for serious all-mountain, enduro, and DH riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Time Xysto large platform ATAC clipless mountain bike pedals</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Time-Xysto-large-platform-clipless-mountain-bike-pedals_photo-by-Jack-Berg_the-underside-of-Braydon-Bringhurst.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Time-Xysto-large-platform-clipless-mountain-bike-pedals_photo-by-Jack-Berg_the-underside-of-Braydon-Bringhurst.webp\" alt=\"Time Xysto large platform clipless mountain bike pedals, under Braydon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Time-Xysto-large-platform-clipless-mountain-bike-pedals_photo-by-Jack-Berg_the-underside-of-Braydon-Bringhurst.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Time-Xysto-large-platform-clipless-mountain-bike-pedals_photo-by-Jack-Berg_the-underside-of-Braydon-Bringhurst-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Time-Xysto-large-platform-clipless-mountain-bike-pedals_photo-by-Jack-Berg_the-underside-of-Braydon-Bringhurst-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Time-Xysto-large-platform-clipless-mountain-bike-pedals_photo-by-Jack-Berg_the-underside-of-Braydon-Bringhurst-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Time-Xysto-large-platform-clipless-mountain-bike-pedals_photo-by-Jack-Berg_the-underside-of-Braydon-Bringhurst-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos by Jack Berg/Time)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Time created the new large platform Xysto clipless pedals for DH and enduro racers looking for more pedal support when riding fast, technical terrain.
