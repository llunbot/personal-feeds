Notably, the ‌Apple Music‌ Classical app for Android comes before Apple has made the app available for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2021, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-service/\">Apple announced</a> that it had purchased the classical music streaming service Primephonic and would be folding it into ‌Apple Music‌ via a new app dedicated to the genre. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-music-classical-now-available/\">launched</a> ‌Apple Music‌ Classical in March, offering a standalone experience for discovering and listening to classical music. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Music‌ Classical app offers ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers access to over five million classical music tracks, including new high-quality releases, in addition to hundreds of curated playlists, thousands of exclusive albums, and other features like composer bios and deep dives on key works.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app offers a simpler interface for interacting with classical music specifically. Unlike the existing ‌Apple Music‌ app, ‌Apple Music‌ Classical allows users to search by composer, work, conductor, catalog number, and more. Users can get more detailed information from editorial notes and descriptions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple commissioned high-resolution digital portraits of famous composers like Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, and Johann Sebastian Bach for the app, using color palettes and artistic references from the relevant classical period, with more unique artwork to be added over time. Apple works with classical music artists and institutions to offer exclusive content and recordings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Music‌ Classical app for Android is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.android.music.classical\">available now on the Google Play Store</a>. Users must have an ‌Apple Music‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a> subscription to use the app.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-classical/\">Apple Music Classical</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-music-classical-now-available-for-android/\">Apple Music Classical Now Available for Android</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-classical-now-available-for-android.2390886/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"87961931835ac6f1469cc98b381d055662712ed728e37575af9866dfb43815a8","category":"Apple"}
