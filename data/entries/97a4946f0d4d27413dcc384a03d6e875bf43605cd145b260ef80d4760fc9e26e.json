We're way past <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SUJNspeux8\">the iPod in the pocket</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeQlgdZZJBw\">MacBook Air in the manila envelope</a>—the closest we got was this shot of Cook smiling next to a slick-looking demo unit on a stand, taken after the presentation was over.</p>\n<p>But I've noticed something else in the last 24 hours, as initial hands-on impressions have been published by various outlets (ours is coming soon). There are, as far as I can find, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23750003/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-the-best-headset-demo-ever\">no</a> actual <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-vision-pro-i-tried-the-new-mixed-reality-headset-f49a8811\">photos</a> or videos of any <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html\">writer</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFvXuyITwBI\">YouTuber</a> wearing the thing they are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/technology/personaltech/apple-vision-pro-headset-try.html\">writing</a> or YouTubing about. (At least one writer has said that <a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/apple-vision-pro-xr-hands-on-preview/\">this was a precondition for getting hands-on time</a>.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945619#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945619&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"97a4946f0d4d27413dcc384a03d6e875bf43605cd145b260ef80d4760fc9e26e","category":"Tech"}
