Well, now it’s fall (in the Northern Hemisphere) and we’ve now reached the stage of the news cycle where we’re all waiting for the news to drop, but instead we’re getting reports that the news is dropping soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest report comes from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who’s really been the most persistent source for these reports of the M4 Mac release. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1848723937880117481\">a new X post</a>, Gurman reiterated what he’s reported in the past, stating that the Mac release is coming “very soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>In line with what I’ve been reporting for a while, Apple will very soon launch its new Macs. There should be some hands-ons outside of Cupertino and online video. I expect the M4 iMac, MacBook Pro, revamped Mac mini and USB-C accessories. <a href=\"https://t.co/I1bDoPjGiP\">https://t.co/I1bDoPjGiP</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1848723937880117481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 22, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman states that there will be “hands-on outside of Cupertino,” which likely means that the company is holding in-person demonstrations for a small number of media in New York City or other locations, something the company has done several times in the past, including for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2119519/apple-scary-fast-event-live-updates-mac-macbook-magic-mouse.html\">last year’s “Scary Fast” event</a> that also had an in-person gathering in Mexico City.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also reports that there will be an “online video” but doesn’t offer specifics, like if the video will be a full presentation or a series of lengthy ads. After the release of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini</a> (which was rumored to be released with the M4 Macs), there was a thought that Apple would forego a Mac event and simply issue press releases, which could still happen–after all, a new product release in and of itself is an “event” for Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman has reported in the past that the M4 Macs to be released will be the MacBook Pro, iMac, and a redesigned Mac mini. The reports of USB-C accessories have picked up momentum recently as well, with a MacRumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/apple-new-magic-mouse-trackpad-keyboard/\">report</a> that code in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1 release candidate</a> includes code for a new Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad 2, and “several new Magic Keyboards.” Apple’s Mac accessories are among the last to have a Lightning port after Apple updated the AirPods Max in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yep, by all accounts, the M4 Macs are still coming–maybe even by the time you read this, Apple will have made the official announcement. But if they didn’t, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2426453/m4-processor-mac-mini-studio-pro-imac-macbook-air.html\">lowdown on the M4 Mac release cycle for the whole Mac lineup</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"91427c2614c9564ce13c651bc97f3e622b6951336acbcedf92c1ce9f432f3fae","category":"Apple"}
