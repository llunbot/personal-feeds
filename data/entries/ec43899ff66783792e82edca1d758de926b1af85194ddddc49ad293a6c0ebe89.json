{"title":"Simplify and enhance Amazon S3 static website hosting with AWS Amplify Hosting","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-and-enhance-amazon-s3-static-website-hosting-with-aws-amplify/","date":1730307810000,"content":"<p>We are announcing an integration between <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/\">AWS Amplify Hosting</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>. Now, you can deploy static websites with content stored in your S3 buckets and serve over a content delivery network (CDN) with just a few clicks.</p> \n<p>AWS Amplify Hosting is a fully managed service for hosting static sites that handles various aspects of deploying a website. It gives you benefits such as custom domain configuration with SSL, redirects, custom headers, and deployment on a globally available CDN powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a>.</p> \n<p>When deploying a static website, Amplify remembers the connection between your S3 bucket and deployed website, so you can easily update your website with a single click when you make changes to website content in your S3 bucket. Using AWS Amplify Hosting is the recommended approach for static website hosting because it offers more streamlined and faster deployment without extensive setup.</p> \n<p>Here’s how the integration works starting from the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3 console</a>:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/25/News_2024_1015_S3-Hosting-DemoVideo.gif\" width=\"1280\" height=\"593\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Deploying a static website using the Amazon S3 console<br /></strong></span>Let’s use this new integration to host a personal website directly from my S3 bucket.</p> \n<p>To get started, I navigate to my bucket in the Amazon S3 console . Here’s the list of all the content in that S3 bucket:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/02/2024-s3-amplify-3.png\" width=\"1636\" height=\"1612\" /></p> \n<p>To use the new integration with AWS Amplify Hosting, I navigate to the <strong>Properties section</strong>, then I scroll down until I find <strong>Static website hosting</strong> and select <strong>Create Amplify app</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/18/2024-s3-amplify-3-1.png\" width=\"4895\" height=\"1969\" /></p> \n<p>Then, it redirects me to the Amplify page and populates the details from my S3 bucket. Here, I configure my <strong>App name</strong> and the <strong>Branch name</strong>. Then, I select <strong>Save and deploy</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/02/2024-s3-amplify-4.png\" width=\"3390\" height=\"1522\" /></p> \n<p>Within seconds, AWS Amplify has deployed my static website, and I can visit the site by selecting <strong>Visit deployed URL</strong>. If I make any subsequent changes in my S3 bucket for my static website, I need to redeploy my application in the Amplify console by selecting the <strong>Deploy updates</strong> button.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/02/2024-s3-amplify-5.png\" width=\"1673\" height=\"718\" /></p> \n<p>I can also use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a> for programmatic deployment. To do that, I need to get the values for required parameters, such as <code>APP_ID</code> and <code>BRANCH_NAME</code> from my AWS Amplify dashboard. Here’s the command I use for deployment:</p> \n<pre><code>aws amplify start-deployment --appId APP_ID --branchName BRANCH_NAME --sourceUrlType=BUCKET_PREFIX --sourceUrl s3://S3_BUCKET/S3_PREFIX</code></pre> \n<p>After Amplify Hosting generates a URL for my website, I can optionally configure a custom domain for my static website. To do that, I navigate to my apps in AWS Amplify and select <strong>Custom domains</strong> in the navigation pane. Then, I select <strong>Add domain </strong>to start configuring a custom domain for my static website. Learn more about setting up custom domains in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html\">Amplify Hosting User Guide</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/02/2024-s3-amplify-6.png\" width=\"2955\" height=\"1290\" /></p> \n<p>In the following screenshot, I have my static website configured with my custom domain. Amplify also issues an SSL/TLS certificate for my domain so that all traffic is secured through HTTPS.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/02/2024-s3-amplify-7.png\" width=\"3766\" height=\"1774\" /></p> \n<p>Now, I have my static site ready, and I can check it out at <a href=\"https://donnie.id\">https://donnie.id</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/02/2024-s3-amplify-8.png\" width=\"3698\" height=\"1956\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Things you need to know<br /></strong></span><strong>More available features –</strong> AWS Amplify Hosting has more features you can use for your static websites.
