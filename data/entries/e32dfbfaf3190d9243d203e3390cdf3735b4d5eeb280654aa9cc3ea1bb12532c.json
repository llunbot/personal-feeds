Its electronic health records (EHR) software (such as MyChart) is reportedly used in <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/31-numbers-that-show-how-big-epic-cerner-allscripts-meditech-are-in-healthcare.html\">over 29 percent</a> of acute hospitals in the United States, and <a href=\"https://www.epic.com/about\">over 305 million</a> patients have an electronic record in Epic worldwide.

In layperson's terms, it means that companies can hire Microsoft to provide generative AI services for them using Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932593#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932593&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e32dfbfaf3190d9243d203e3390cdf3735b4d5eeb280654aa9cc3ea1bb12532c","category":"Tech"}
