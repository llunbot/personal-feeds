{"title":"Dow Claimed to Be Recycling Used Sneakers; Reuters Used AirTags to Prove They Weren’t","link":"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-plastic-dow-shoes/","date":1677814897000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Brock, Yuddy Cahya Budiman, and Joseph Campbell, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At a rundown market on the Indonesian island of Batam, a small\nlocation tracker was beeping from the back of a crumbling\nsecond-hand shoe store. A Reuters reporter followed the\nhigh-pitched ping to a mound of old sneakers and began digging\nthrough the pile.</p>\n\n<p>There they were: a pair of blue Nike running shoes with a tracking\ndevice hidden in one of the soles.</p>\n\n<p>These familiar shoes had traveled by land, then sea and crossed an\ninternational border to end up in this heap. They weren’t supposed\nto be here.</p>\n\n<p>Five months earlier, in July 2022, Reuters had given the shoes to\na recycling program spearheaded by the Singapore government and\nU.S. petrochemicals giant Dow Inc. In media releases and a\npromotional video posted online, that effort promised to harvest\nthe rubberized soles and midsoles of donated shoes, then grind\ndown the material for use in building new playgrounds and running\ntracks in Singapore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Remarkable reporting by Reuters. After donating 11 pairs of sneakers (all of which contained hidden AirTags) at different drop-off spots in Indonesia, they flew all over Asia to track them down, and found most of them in used clothing stores. <em>None</em> of the 11 pairs were turned into exercise paths or playgrounds, as Dow claimed they would be. Not only is the whole greenwashing initiative by Dow an apparent scam, it’s illegal in Indonesia. And don’t miss the video — it’s really good, but, alas, ends a bit like <em>Chinatown</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Great gumshoe reporting, in both the literal and figurative senses.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/02/dow-reuters-used-sneakers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3aa02a879c41b369a593c818f2fb6eab64330f136ecabc635bfbd5059bf9da4b","category":"Tech"}
