According to a statement provided to <a href=\"https://privacy4cars.com/\">Privacy4Cars</a>, and reported by The Record, Verisk will no longer provide a \"Driving Behavior Data History Report\" to insurers.</p>\n<p>Skeptics have long assumed that car companies had at least some plan to monetize the rich data regularly sent from cars back to their manufacturers, or telematics. But a concrete example of this was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html\">reported by The New York Times' Kashmir Hill</a>, in which drivers of GM vehicles were finding insurance more expensive, or impossible to acquire, because of the kinds of reports sent along the chain from GM to data brokers to insurers. Those who requested their collected data from the brokers found details of every trip they took: times, distances, and every \"hard acceleration\" or \"hard braking event,\" among other data points.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030993#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030993&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c553c0c51a97fac353f43c7e44d8c173575497a5a4293ffe77efe465c40e4091","category":"Tech"}
