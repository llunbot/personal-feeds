It was spun out of Volvo in 2017 as a standalone performance electric brand, and in 2019, we tried its first car, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/the-polestar-1-is-a-turbocharged-supercharged-plug-in-hybrid-enigma/\">a low-volume plug-in hybrid GT</a> that wowed us but only ever amounted to 1,500 cars. Next came <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/the-2021-polestar-2-has-a-great-cabin-and-deep-android-integration/\">the Polestar 2</a>, a compact four-door sedan that was one of the first cars to deeply integrate Google's automotive services. But now it's time for the cars most of Polestar's potential customers have been waiting for—SUVs. And it's starting with the $73,400 Polestar 3.</p>\n<p>Although Volvo has sold its shares in Polestar (leaving its parent company Geely as Polestar's sole corporate parent), the two companies will continue to share technology and platforms. The Polestar 3 is built on the group's SPA2 architecture, which is also being used by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/volvos-next-electric-vehicle-is-the-new-us-made-ex90-suv/\">the forthcoming Volvo EX90</a>; indeed, both are going into production at Volvo's factory in South Carolina this year.</p>\n<p>As a measure of how far the company has come in a relatively short time, the Polestar 3 generates less carbon emissions during production than the smaller, cheaper Polestar 2 when it was introduced in 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029918#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029918&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
