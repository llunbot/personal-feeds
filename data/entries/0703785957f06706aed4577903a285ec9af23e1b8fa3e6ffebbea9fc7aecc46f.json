And while <a href=\"https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=8388#p64988\">recent advancements in pixel-flipping times</a> have enabled TCL's LCD prototype, Blur Busters estimates that 1,000 Hz OLED displays could be commercialized as soon as 2027.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4K 1000Hz being shown off at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisplayWeek2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DisplayWeek2024</a> by TCL CSOT <a href=\"https://t.co/xc2qsYocxX\">pic.twitter.com/xc2qsYocxX</a></p>\n<p>— Blur Busters (@BlurBusters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlurBusters/status/1790773962563273119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The apparent impending breaking of the four-digit refresh rate threshold got us thinking: Are we finally approaching a point of diminishing returns in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/480-hz-desktop-laptop-displays-teased-by-pc-panel-pusher-auo/\">monitor-makers' long-running battle of the Hz</a>? Or is 1,000 Hz just the latest stepping stone to realms of motion smoothness yet unimagined by most gamers?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025737#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025737&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0703785957f06706aed4577903a285ec9af23e1b8fa3e6ffebbea9fc7aecc46f","category":"Tech"}
