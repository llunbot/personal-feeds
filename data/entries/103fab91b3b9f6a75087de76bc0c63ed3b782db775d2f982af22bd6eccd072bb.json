Amid the company's largest-ever wave of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/amazon-is-firing-another-9000-workers/\">layoffs</a> and reports that even the popular Alexa voice assistant has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/\">failed</a> to bring in money, this wasn't surprising.

And the Halo that Amazon reportedly tried to realize is one we're happy not to encounter.</p>\n<h2>Halo reportedly creeped out its own creators</h2>\n<p>Reported plans for Halo could have pushed products to gather more data on how users exercise in order to provide virtual rewards, to offer recommendations, and to track performance. However, the features Amazon is said to have explored sound potentially invasive, collecting uniquely personal data.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935572#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935572&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"103fab91b3b9f6a75087de76bc0c63ed3b782db775d2f982af22bd6eccd072bb","category":"Tech"}
