That’s key as it will likely be an exclusive to a Canyon gravel bike, at least at first. But it looks very much like a DT Swiss suspension product, in line with their previous mountain bike fork designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_side-bike-profile-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_side-bike-profile-jpg.webp\" alt=\"prototype Canyon x DT Swiss race-ready 40mm gravel suspension fork, Spy Shot photo by Moritz Sauer, racing on Canyon Grail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_side-bike-profile-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_side-bike-profile-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_side-bike-profile-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_side-bike-profile-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_side-bike-profile-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s just start off with a quick statement that, we don’t have official details at all yet. And most likely this isn’t hitting the market too soon. It’s the first and only instance we’ve heard about of this new fork, and it’s on a solid racer, but not one really fighting at the front for the podium. This looks a lot like Canyon &amp; DT Swiss collecting performance and durability data in a real-world racing situation to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-side-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-side-jpg.webp\" alt=\"prototype Canyon x DT Swiss race-ready 40mm gravel suspension fork, Spy Shot photo by Moritz Sauer, post-race side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-side-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-side-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-side-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-side-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-side-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, most notable is the reverse arch design… just like we see on Fox’s latest lightweight <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2025-fox-32-step-cast-xc-fork-first-rides-review/\" target=\"_blank\">XC</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fox-32-taper-cast-gravel-bike-suspension-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel</a> forks since the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/manitou-unveils-lighter-xc-fork-shock-plus-retro-mattoc/\" target=\"_blank\">Manitou</a> patent has opened up. What we can surmise based on zooming and measuring how the bike sat at the start of the race with Schermann leaning on the bar… I’d guess that this prototype Canyon x DT Swiss gravel suspension fork offers 40mm of travel, with 30mm stanchions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-jpg.webp\" alt=\"prototype Canyon x DT Swiss race-ready 40mm gravel suspension fork, Spy Shot photo by Moritz Sauer, racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_racing-left-tapered-leg-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also see a remote lockout, with controls either wireless or mechanical routed internally to a lever that Schermann has mounted on the left-hand drop of his handlebar. And front brake line routing that comes out of the back of the fork crown. Plus, there are bolts at the base of either side of the arch, maybe for a fender mount, perhaps?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"prototype Canyon x DT Swiss race-ready 40mm gravel suspension fork, Spy Shot photo by Moritz Sauer, reverse arch detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-x-DT-Swiss-race-ready-gravel-suspension-fork-prototype_photo-by-Moritz-Sauer_Daun-German-Nats_muddy-crown-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototype DT gravel fork features the same style of integrated covers on both sides of the fork crown like we first saw on their original <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-introduces-position-sensitive-damping-on-new-535-one-trail-fork/\">535 One</a> all-mountain fork.

And they even confirm what the label on the fork crown says – it is “<em>a co-development</em>” between Canyon &amp; DT. But beyond that most basic level, it was more of a ‘no comment’ type response, acknowledging ongoing product development and real-world testing in the suspension realm.
