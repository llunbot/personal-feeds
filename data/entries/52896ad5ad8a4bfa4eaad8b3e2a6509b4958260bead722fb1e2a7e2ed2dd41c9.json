{"title":"Austin Mann’s iPhone 13 Pro Camera Review: Tanzania","link":"https://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-13-pro-camera-review-tanzania","date":1632431447000,"content":"\n<p>No big deal — just a safari expedition to Tanzania. Lions, leopards, giraffes. Ultra wide angle 4K 60 video shot from an iPhone 13 Pro mounted to a helicopter. Your typical iPhone camera review.</p>\n\n<p>The review starts with a terrific movie — including some truly pro-looking Cinematic mode shots — by <a href=\"https://mckayfilms.com\">Taylor McKay</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I thought this was a pretty interesting observation from Mann:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although the iPhone 13 Pro still only has three lenses, the\naddition of macro capability is like adding a new lens altogether,\nand for the serious photographer I think it’s perhaps the\nstrongest advancement in this year’s camera system. […]</p>\n\n<p>Photographer or not, you’ve seen the big and heavy backpacks\nphotographers carry with them on every shoot. Whether it’s local\nor international, we lug these bags full of lenses around because\neach one offers a new perspective on whatever story it is that\nwe’re telling.</p>\n\n<p>As a photographer passionate about the natural world, I carry a\nmacro lens with me no matter what project I’m working on, just\nbecause I never know what tiny detail of interest might present\nitself. Now with the macro capability of the iPhone 13 Pro, I feel\nlike I have my “in-a-pinch” macro shots covered and I can leave\nthe rarely-used macro lens at home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everything you see in this video was shot with a $1,000 device meant to fit in your pocket.</p>\n\n<p>Some great iOS 15 tips from Mann, too, including using the new Focus feature to create a custom “Shoot Mode” with no notifications whenever he’s using the Camera app or Halide. Also, Mann’s custom Photographic Style settings.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/23/mann-mckay-iphone-13-tanzania\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"52896ad5ad8a4bfa4eaad8b3e2a6509b4958260bead722fb1e2a7e2ed2dd41c9","category":"Tech"}
