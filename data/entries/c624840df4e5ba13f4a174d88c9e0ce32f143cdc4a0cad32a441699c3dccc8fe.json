That’s because, generally speaking, aluminium frames combine a desirable stiffness level with low overall weight and relatively cheap production costs.</p>\n<p>Bikes such as the Triban RC120 and Vitus Razor Claris prove that a quality road bike can still be had for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cheap-road-bikes/\">less than £500</a>. Bikes such as the Triban RC520 show that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-under-1000/\">road bikes under £1,000</a> can compete with pricier machines, too, with great specs and features such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a>, which are available on more and more budget bikes.</p>\n<p>Spend a little more and the prevalence of aluminium thins out in favour of cheaper carbon fibre bikes.</p>\n<p>However, aluminium bikes at this price point – roughly between £1,000 and £2,500 – still regularly offer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/this-is-why-its-time-to-stop-buying-cheap-carbon-bikes/\">considerably better value</a>, and sometimes a better ride, than similarly priced carbon models.</p>\n<p><span>Fans of the pro peloton may have seen alloy come and go as the material of choice for the world’s fastest racers, but that doesn’t mean alloy frames have plateaued in terms of development. </span></p>\n<p>Spend well into four figures and you’ll get access to the likes of Cannondale’s CAAD13 – a showcase for the latest aluminium tech and a bike that can fight it out with all but the absolute best carbon fibre machines.</p>\n<p>That’s enough of the background, now let’s crack on with our pick of the best aluminium road bikes, from budget bargains to alloy superbikes.</p>\n<p>Every bike here has been tested and reviewed by our team and, i<span>n order to be included in this list, a bike must have scored at least 4 out of 5 stars in our testing.</span></p>\n<h2>Best aluminium road bikes in 2023, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Triban RC120</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n

Reflective of that is a pretty familiar <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">race bike geometry</a>, maximum tyre width of 28mm and no mounts for mudguards or accessories.</p>\n<p>Out on the road, the bike’s stiff frame means it is great at climbing and descending. The ride is reasonably smooth but certainly firm.
