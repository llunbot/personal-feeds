The third flight of the world's most powerful rocket, following a pair of test launches last year, is scheduled for Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>SpaceX's Starship rocket and Super Heavy booster will take off from the Starbase test site on the Texas Gulf Coast, a few miles north of the US-Mexico border. The launch window for the nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) rocket opens at 7 am CDT (12:00 UTC) Thursday and extends for 110 minutes. You can watch the launch live on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceX\">SpaceX's X page</a>, or on one of several third-party YouTube live streams.
