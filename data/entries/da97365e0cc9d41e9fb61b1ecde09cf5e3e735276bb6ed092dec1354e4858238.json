Apple’s 2024 Black Friday deal has been announced. As usual the company will be giving away gift cards with values up to $200/£160 with select purchases made in the Apple Store (online and in person) on Black Friday as well as Saturday, Sunday and on Cyber Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We find that the best deals are from resellers rather than Apple itself, and we track them all so we can help you find the best deals on Apple products including the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1376743/best-apple-watch-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/best-macbook-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">MacBooks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-iphone-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">iPhones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1377158/best-airpods-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">AirPods</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/best-ipad-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">iPads</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can peruse our individual round-ups of the best deals for Black Friday to find a bargain.

As usual, it will be giving away gift cards with select purchases in 2024 from November 29 to December 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see how much Apple will give away in 2024 and compared to 2023 and 2022 below.

You will notice that the newest products aren’t included, so there are no discounts associated with iPhone 16, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, iMac, or Apple Watch 10, for example.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$25/£20 Apple Gift Card:</strong> AirPods 4, iPhone SE, Apple TV 4K, Apple Pencil Pro, Apple Pencil (2nd generation), Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro (M4), Magic Keyboard for iPad Air (M2), Magic Keyboard Folio, Smart Folio for iPad Pro, Smart Folio for iPads Pro, Air And 10th gen, Beats Solo Buds, Beats Pill, or Beats Flex</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$50/£40 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPhone 14, HomePod, AirPods Pro 2, Apple Watch SE, iPad 10th gen, Beats Studio Pro, Beats Solo 4 Wireless, Beats Fit Pro, Beats Studio Buds +</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$75/£60 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPhone 15, AirPods Max, <strong> </strong>iPad Air (M2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$100/£80 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPad Pro (M4)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$150/£120</strong> <strong>Apple Gift Card</strong>: 13-inch MacBook Air (M2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$175/£140</strong> <strong>Apple Gift Card</strong>: 13-inch MacBook Air (M3)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$200/£160 Apple Gift Card</strong>: 15-inch MacBook Air (M3)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\"> Get Apple's Black Friday offer (U.S.)</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\"> Get Apple's Black Friday offer (U.K.)</a></div>\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Black-Friday-vouchers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Black Friday Apple giftcards\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Black-Friday-vouchers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 944w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Black-Friday-vouchers.jpg?resize=300%2C249&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Black-Friday-vouchers.jpg?resize=768%2C637&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"944\" height=\"783\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Screenshot</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 this is what Apple gave away over the Black Friday weekend:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$25/£20 Apple Gift Card:</strong> iPhone SE, AirPods (2nd-gen), AirPods (3rd-gen), Beats Flex, Apple Pencil (2nd-gen), Smart Keyboard Folio, Apple TV</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$50/£40 Apple Gift Card</strong>: Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 9, HomePod, Beats Studio Pro, Beats Solo3 Wireless, Powerbeats Pro, Beats Fit Pro, Beats Studio Buds +, Beats Studio Buds, Magic Keyboard, Magic Keyboard Folio,  iPhone 13, AirPods Pro (2nd-gen)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$75/£60 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPhone 14, AirPods Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$100/£80 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad 10th gen, iPad Pro, Mac mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$150/£120 Apple Gift Card</strong>: 13-inch MacBook Air (M1)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$175/£140 Apple Gift Card</strong>: 13-inch MacBook Air (M2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$200/£160 Apple Gift Card</strong>: 15-inch MacBook Air</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the iPhone 15, M3 iMac, and M3-series MacBook Pro were all introduced in November 2023 Apple wasn’t offering any vouchers with those purchases that year. But the company did offer gift cards with Apple Watch 9 purchases. In 2024 the Apple Watch 10 is not included in the offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How good is Apple’s 2024 Black Friday deal?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 deal is pretty similar to the 2023 deal, the main difference being that the Apple Watch Series 10 is not included, where the Apple Watch Series 9 was. The deal was even better in 2022 when Apple offered up to $250/£250 in Apple Gift Cards with the MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch. The biggest disappointment is that the MacBook Pro, Mac mini, iMac, iPhone 16 and other new products aren’t included, Apple rarely includes the newest items and these products were only just updated. One change is that the AirPods 4 do get a gift card accompaniment  despite being launched in September. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><em>2024</em></td><td><em>2023</em></td><td><em>2022</em></td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 15</td><td>$75</td><td>–</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 14</td><td>$50</td><td>$75</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13</td><td>n/a</td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE</td><td>$25</td><td>$25</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Pro</td><td>$100</td><td>$50</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Air</td><td>$75</td><td>$75</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>iPad mini </td><td>–</td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>iPad (10th gen.)</td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>iPad (9th gen.)</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>$30</td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air</td><td>$200</td><td>$200</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>13-inch MacBook Air</td><td>$175</td><td>$175</td><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>13-inch MacBook Air (M2)</td><td>$150</td><td>$150</td><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini</td><td>–</td><td>$100</td><td>$100</td></tr><tr><td>MacBook Pro 14-inch &amp; 16-inch</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>$250</td></tr><tr><td>iMac 24-inch</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Series 10</td><td>–</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Series 9 </td><td>n/a</td><td>$50</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Apple Watch SE</strong></td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>AirPods (2nd generation) </td><td>n/a</td><td>$25</td><td>$25</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AirPods (3rd generation)</strong></td><td>n/a</td><td>$25</td><td>$25</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AirPods 4</strong></td><td>$25</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>AirPods Pro (2nd generation)</td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>AirPods Max</td><td>$75</td><td>$75</td><td>$75</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Pencil (2nd generation) </td><td>$25</td><td>$25 </td><td>$25 </td></tr><tr><td>HomePod</td><td>$50</td><td>$50</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Apple TV 4K</strong></td><td>$25</td><td>$25 </td><td>n/a</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2022’s deal actually went a little further than Apple’s 2021 Black Friday offer. Although that depends on your perspective – you could also think that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1383475/apples-black-friday-shopping-event-is-somehow-worse-this-year.html\">Apple’s Black Friday shopping event was worse in 2022</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 the biggest Apple Gift Card on offer was for $200/£160, which was the saving offered with the sale of the 27-inch iMac (which was discontinued in 2022). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2024: Best deals for Apple products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Apple Black Friday 2024 sale</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/apple-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Apple deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373696/mac-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Mac Deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/macbook-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 MacBook deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1377158/airpods-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 AirPods deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1376743/apple-watch-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Apple Watch deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/ipad-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 iPad deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/iphone-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 iPhone deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375200/mac-monitor-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Mac monitor deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373771/mac-storage-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 SSD and external hard drive deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677125/apple-accessory-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Apple accessory deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2531213/best-black-friday-deals-on-mac-thunderbolt-usb-c-docks-hubs.html\">Best Black Friday deals on Mac Thunderbolt and USB-C docks and hubs</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2024: When do the sales begin?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Friday officially begins at 12:01 am on the day after Thanksgiving, which in 2024 is Friday, November 29. However, the sales begin well before that–we saw deals starting at the beginning of November. The main event runs through the weekend and concludes on Cyber Monday, which is December 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2024: Where to get the best deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotting a good Black Friday deal takes a bit of work but we’ll be doing most of it for you. Throughout Black Friday weekend, we’ll be posting deal roundups and calling out specific sales that are worth checking out. Stay tuned to Macworld as we call out the best—and worst—deals all throughout the weekend. These are the retailers that are most likely to have the best prices:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned to Macworld to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.costco.com\">Costco</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.target.com\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ao.com\" target=\"_blank\">AO.com</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Argos</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.carphonewarehouse.com\" target=\"_blank\">Carphone Warehouse</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Currys</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com\" target=\"_blank\">eBuyer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com\" target=\"_blank\">John Lewis</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.krcs.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">KRCS</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Laptops Direct</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.very.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Very</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday: Should I wait for Cyber Monday to purchase?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s always possible that a better deal is waiting around the corner, if you see a good deal, don’t wait. While Cyber Monday promises impressive deals, prices are usually lowest on Black Friday. Plus there’s always the risk that the Apple device you want sells out and you miss out on the great deal everyone else got.</p>\n\n\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"da97365e0cc9d41e9fb61b1ecde09cf5e3e735276bb6ed092dec1354e4858238","category":"Apple"}
