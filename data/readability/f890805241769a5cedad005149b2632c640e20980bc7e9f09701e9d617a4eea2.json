I dropped a message to Brad Bingham, the builder of my bike, to ask if I could see his factory/workshop. After a brief tour, he invited my wife and I out for a ride.&nbsp;Brad and his wife are amazing people, maybe just as amazing as their bikes! They took us out to Stagecoach Reservoir and onto some ‘secret’ dirt roads. I won this bike in the CXC fundraiser raffle which benefits the manufacture of adaptive sit-skis. More great prizes <a href=\"https://cxcskiing.org/drawing?fbclid=IwAR2bKscAXFGdr5LbKYMfeDYXkHMkc2qG9vTzw6Vi5ooxFIWQnDTq9K9ZjH4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are available this year</a>.”</p><p>Bike: Bingham Built with S &amp; S couplers<br>Fork: ENVE All Road<br>Wheels: HED Emporia<br>Group: SRAM Red/Force AXS<br>Cockpit: Bontrager XXX bar and post, Elite stem, and Aeolus special edition saddle.</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
