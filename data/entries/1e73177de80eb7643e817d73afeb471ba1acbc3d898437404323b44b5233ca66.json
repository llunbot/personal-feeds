These peripherals continue to feature a Lightning port and are completely unchanged following Apple's series of Mac-related announcements. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's decision to leave the accessories unchanged is notable because the company has otherwise progressively been moving to USB-C. The entire <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup, all latest-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Remote for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> all now feature a USB-C port. Other than the three peripherals that accompany the ‌iMac‌, the only latest-generation Apple devices that still have a Lightning port are the AirPods, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/\">Lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/\">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/\">Magic Keyboard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-trackpad/\">Magic Trackpad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/\">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/magic-accessories-still-feature-lightning/\">Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse Still Feature Lightning Instead of USB-C</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magic-keyboard-magic-trackpad-and-magic-mouse-still-feature-lightning-instead-of-usb-c.2409261/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1e73177de80eb7643e817d73afeb471ba1acbc3d898437404323b44b5233ca66","category":"Apple"}
