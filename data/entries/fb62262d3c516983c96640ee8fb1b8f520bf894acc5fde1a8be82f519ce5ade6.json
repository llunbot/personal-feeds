It is also possible to make a reservation through the latest version of the Apple Store app. Apple will ask you a few questions to get started, including whether you wear prescription eyeglasses or contacts, in order to prepare ZEISS optical inserts for your demo if necessary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the meantime, Vision Pro demos are available from today through Sunday at all Apple Stores in the U.S. on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no way to reserve a demo on these days, so you simply need to show up and wait.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Be one of the first to get a demo of Apple Vision Pro,\" reads a new banner added to Apple's website today. \"We invite you to sign up for a demo at your local Apple Store.
