In 2022, the Korean government <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/interpol-issues-red-notice-for-crypto-founder-do-kwon/\">filed a \"red notice\" with Interpol</a>, seeking Kwon's arrest and his return to Korea. A few months later, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Kwon with <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-32\">fraud</a> in the US.</p>\n<p>On September 17, 2022, Kwon <a href=\"https://x.com/stablekwon/status/1571197156907679745\">famously tweeted</a>, \"I am not 'on the run' or anything similar\"â€”but he also wouldn't say where he was. He didn't help his case when he was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65058533\">arrested in March 2023</a> by the authorities in Montenegro. At an airport. With fake travel documents. On his way to a country with no US extradition agreement.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/do-kwon-the-crypto-bro-behind-40b-luna-terra-collapse-finally-extradited-to-us/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/do-kwon-the-crypto-bro-behind-40b-luna-terra-collapse-finally-extradited-to-us/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"abafe359bb35e8ba2a32649dfc6cff929bcd115decaf64c478710f07ed528e31","category":"Tech"}
