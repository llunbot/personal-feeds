This information comes from both Young's tweets and additional details that he shared with MacRumors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Pro-Display-XDR-Red.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs with Apple's high-end 32-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Pro Display XDR</a>, Young told MacRumors that the 27-inch display will feature mini-LED backlighting, which likely means that it will have XDR branding. Young tweeted that Apple is currently planning to release the new display <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1450662540002795526\">in the first quarter of 2022</a>, and he said it will be considerably less expensive than the Pro Display XDR's $4,999 price tag, but exact pricing remains to be seen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYoung added that the 27-inch display <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1450672633582735361\">will feature ProMotion</a>, allowing for an adaptive refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. At the time this story was published, Young did not say what the display's resolution would be â€” the Pro Display XDR has 6K resolution.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has introduced a few other products with mini-LED displays, including the 12.9-inch iPad Pro earlier this year and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro this week. Young expects Apple's recent leadership with mini-LEDs to continue with this standalone display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYoung has proven to be very accurate with display-related rumors, having accurately forecasted that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/ipad-mini-6-display-design-info/\">new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display</a> and that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/macbook-pro-120hz-mini-led-display/\">new MacBook Pro models would feature ProMotion</a>. Young has 25 years of experience in the display industry and seems to be well connected with sources within the supply chain.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman was first to report that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-lower-priced-external-display-rumor/\">working on a new lower-priced standalone display</a> back in January. It would be Apple's first consumer-oriented display since the Thunderbolt Display was discontinued in 2016.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-27-inch-xdr-display-early-2022-rumor/\">Apple Rumored to Launch Lower-Priced 27-Inch Version of Pro Display XDR With ProMotion in Early 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rumored-to-launch-lower-priced-27-inch-version-of-pro-display-xdr-with-promotion-in-early-2022.2318114/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AQtbadmkkeM:dVmNxYXCibE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AQtbadmkkeM:dVmNxYXCibE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AQtbadmkkeM\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8692fa480ac96181e8aaef5caa2251def48d7a7f9eeceee6df098cb48bceb09e","category":"Apple"}
