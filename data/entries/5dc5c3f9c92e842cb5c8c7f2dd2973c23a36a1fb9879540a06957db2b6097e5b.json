These bikes add a bit more thrash to the XC bike dash, and Canyon has jumped on board with its new Lux Trail.</p>\n<p>Canyon’s Lux Trail has followed the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/specialized-epic-evo-expert-review/\">Specialized Epic Evo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cannondale-scalpel-se-ltd-lefty-review/\">Cannondale Scalpel SE</a> that saw their World Cup-winning XC speed machines beefed up. In the Lux’s case, this sees the addition of more stable geometry and capable components.</p>\n<p>The Lux Trail is claimed to be ideal for riders hunting speed over a wide variety of trails outside the race course or those looking for more confidence and comfort on long marathon-style cross-country races.</p>\n<p>We have a size large in for testing, and Tom has given his initial impressions in his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/canyon-lux-trail-cf-8-review/\">Canyon Lux Trail CF 8 first ride review</a></p>\n<h2>Canyon Lux Trail frame details and suspension</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Lux Trail features a more aggressive geometry and spec to allow it to tackle more demanding terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Canyon has made sure that while the Lux Trail is more capable than the Lux, it isn’t a plump trail bike, and has done its best to keep as much of the Lux’s efficiency as possible. It shares a few features of the Lux, including the rear flexstays and suspension layout.</p>\n<p>The Lux Trail also shares the same carbon layup as the Lux. Still, Canyon claims the frames are approximately 30g heavier than the equivalent size Lux frame due to longer reach numbers.</p>\n<p>To help keep weight to a minimum, Canyon has brought over the Lux’s flexstays to deliver 110mm of rear-wheel travel. This design negates the need for a pivot near the rear axle, shaving grams off the bike, and engineers bending into the stays to allow the necessary flex for the suspension to work. Nowadays, it’s a familiar design among XC bikes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon uses the same flexstay design from its Lux XC bike, so the chainstay/seatstay pivot can be lost to save weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>As both bikes use the same suspension platform, Canyon says the Lux Trail and Lux share similar kinematics and anti-squat values, meaning the Lux Trail should have comparable pedalling characteristics when putting the power down. However, the Lux Trail has that extra 10mm of cushioning to take a fraction more sting out of the trail.</p>\n<p>Canyon has designed the suspension around its Triple Phase Suspension, first incorporated into its Sender downhill bike. This is more of a design philosophy than exact kinematics but means it aims for a supple beginning stroke, plenty of mid-stroke support to help transfer power, and a progressive end stroke to help handle the bigger hits.</p>\n<p>Canyon’s flexstay design is claimed to transfer force directly to the shock with minimal stress on the bearings and pivots at the rocker assembly. Canyon says this has allowed it to make a very lightweight injection-moulded, carbon-reinforced shock extender, which also helps keep the scales from creeping upwards.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Suspension forces from the rear wheel are transferred directly to the shock, meaning Canyon can build a lightweight rocker and shock extender.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Other features include fully sleeved, uninterrupted internal cable routing and Canyon’s IPU (Impact Protection Unit).</p>\n<p>The IPU is a plastic bumper mounted on the top tube and a specific headset cap that prevents the handlebar from over-rotating and damaging the top tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon’s IPU (Impact Protection Unit) prevents frame damage from an over-rotating handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s also a minimalist 8.7g chain guide (guide and bolt) and space for two full-size water bottles.</p>\n<p>Plus, the rear axle uses Canyon’s bolt-through Quixle for tool-free wheel removal.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Lux Trail uses a very minimalist chain guide.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon Bikes</i></span></div>\n<h2>Canyon Lux Trail geometry details</h2>\n<p>It’s in the geometry where you’ll find the most significant differences between the Lux Trail and Lux, with the reach and head tube angle being the two standout changes. Yes, the whole front triangle is new.</p>\n<p>The Lux Trail has a 67.5-degree head-tube angle, which is right in the ballpark for these types of aggressive cross-country bikes.</p>\n<p>The reach values aren’t far off what you would see on an enduro bike, with a size large coming in at 480mm. The Lux Trail has matched these longer reaches with a shorter 60mm stem to keep the rider more centred between the wheels.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Lux Trail range uses a shorter 60mm stem to keep the rider balanced between the wheels when matched with the long reaches.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>While the reach and head tube angles are modern and help the Lux Trail’s descending character, the seat tube lengths are tall and somewhat conservative for allowing riders to really lower the seat out the way. On a size large, there’s a 505mm seat tube.</p>\n<p>The seat tube angle is 74.5 degrees across all sizes, which should allow an efficient seated pedalling position. In addition, the 435mm chainstays should balance stability with agile manoeuvrability.</p>\n<div>\n
