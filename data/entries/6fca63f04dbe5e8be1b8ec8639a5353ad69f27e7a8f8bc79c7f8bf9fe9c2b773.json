So why bother—especially when you can get a Lightning pair for their best price ever: Amazon’s Black Friday Apple sales incude the fantastic Lightning-based AirPods Max headphones for $399, a healthy $150 discount from their $549 MSRP, and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than the port, these AirPods Max are identical to the USB-C model despite some new colors. They have the same design that’s gorgeous and comfortable and come with the same specs and features, including top-notch noise cancelation and super useful transparency mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">our review of the AirPods Max</a>, we gave them a four-star rating, loving the pleasant sound quality and just how well-built they are. “Are the AirPod Max the best wireless noise-cancelling headphones you can buy? For those who rely on the Apple ecosystem, yes. They offer sound quality on par or even slightly better than their competitors and superior noise-cancelling,” we noted in his review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the headphones don’t have a physical button to stop them, they have some super smart sensors that pause audio when you take them off and shut off on their own after a while. They also provide some 20 hours of listening time, and plugging them in for some 5 minutes adds another 90 minutes of listening time. And they have a feature the USB-C model doesn’t have: you can plug in a Lightning-to-3.5mm cable and listen with a wired connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don’t miss out on getting the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?th=1\">AirPods Max at their best price ahead of Black Friday for $399</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the AirPods Max for 27% off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6fca63f04dbe5e8be1b8ec8639a5353ad69f27e7a8f8bc79c7f8bf9fe9c2b773","category":"Apple"}
