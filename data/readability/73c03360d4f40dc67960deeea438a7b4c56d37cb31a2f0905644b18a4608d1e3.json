It holds up to the coldest, sideway-est rain, sleet, and hail a Nordic summer can throw at you (which is <em>surprisingly</em> cold and sideways!).</p><p>It stretches, repels water fantastically well, and stuffs into a jersey pocket. It’s the perfect weight for most conditions, and we found that it’s insulating enough in cold rain with layers underneath, but breathable and light enough for moderate temps, too. Lastly, it has a very soft feel. It’s not crunchy or noisy like most rain shells, it’s very much a thin softshell that’s super comfortable while still being waterproof. Maybe that explains why it’s called the “Magic Shell.”</p><p>We love the full-width external zip pocket, something many cycling raincoats don’t have. That means it is incredibly useful if you know you’re starting a ride in pouring rain but want access to snacks and your phone. It’s also lightweight at 255 grams and has a two-way zipper so you can even access your jersey pockets for bonus snacks.</p><ul><li>Colors: Black, Morocco</li><li>Sizes: XS-XL for women; XS-XL for men</li><li>Material: Polartec NeoShell fabric</li><li>Weight: 255g</li><li>Men/Women Options: Yes</li><li>MSRP: $218</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Incredibly comfortable<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Might be a bit much for hot summer days<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST OVERALL WOMEN’S:<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F141124%2F7mesh-revelation-bike-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 7Mesh Revelation&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155821/7mesh_revelation-best-cycling-raincoats-1536x1005.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a><br>Before the guys skip over this one, the Revelation is available in <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F141124%2F7mesh-revelation-bike-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">men’s sizing</a> as well. But we were so impressed with the care that went into creating a well-fitting women’s specific raincoat that we had to give it this designation.</p><p>Typically, it’s hard to find a women’s rain jacket that’s not just a different colorway, but 7mesh put the effort into creating a version of the <a href=\"https://7mesh.com/womens-revelation-jacket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revelation</a> that took a woman’s body into account, making room in the chest while making it slightly shorter to fit women’s tendency towards shorter torsos compared to men. That means it fits like a dream: no breathing issues up top, and no bunching issues at the waist.</p><p>It’s not as aero as some form-fitting jackets, but it won’t be flapping during road rides <em>and</em> you can fit layers underneath it. This Bikerumor writer has had one for 5+ years of cyclocross racing, hundreds of miles of rainy rides, and even a 50 run…and it’s still in perfect condition.</p><p>We deeply appreciate the removable hood, which makes it much more versatile, as well as the underarm zippers for perfect ventilation. 7mesh uses Gore-Tex in order to provide some of the best waterproofing while still being breathable, and the jacket delivers. In years of wearing (and washing) it, it hasn’t degraded at all.</p><ul><li>Colors: Peacock blue for women, black for men</li><li>Sizes: XS-XL for women; XS-XXL for men</li><li>Material: GORE-TEX Pro</li><li>Weight: 299g</li><li>Men/Women Options: Yes</li><li>MSRP: $475</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Comfortable, thoughtful fit, great all-around<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Limited colors, not ideal for roadies, expensive<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST COMMUTER: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W58CFX4/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome Storm Salute&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155802/chrome-storm-best-cycling-raincoats-1536x1005.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Looking for a raincoat that looks cool and feels comfortable wearing in everyday life, but also is designed to make your commute to work perfectly dry?

The coat has an adjustable hood that can fit over a commuter helmet for downpour situations, a two-way zipper in case you need to get into a back pocket, and plenty of waterproof pockets that allow for phone storage on your ride. We also like the adjustable tail in the back: If you forget your fender, just unhook it and your butt will stay relatively protected from splash. It’s a comfort fit, so you can squeeze a hoodie on under it—this editor has even worn it with a down jacket underneath in the winter with no issues.</p><p>It might sound shallow, but this Bikerumor editor appreciates how the jacket looks off the bike: It’s the only one that doesn’t scream ‘athletic-wear!’ so if you’re running errands or rolling to the bar and want to feel less sporty, this is your best bet.</p><ul><li>Colors: Black and Olive</li><li>Sizes: XS-XL for Women, S-XXL for Men</li><li>Material: Polyester</li><li>Men/Women Options: Yes</li><li>MSRP: $190</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Comfortable and great for off the bike as well as on<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Not for serious cycling—definitely a commuter jacket at heart<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST PACKABLE: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgore-wear-race-shakedry-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GORE Shakedry&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155818/gore-shakedry-best-cycling-raincoats-1536x1005.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>You simply can’t beat a<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgore-wear-race-shakedry-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Gore ShakeDry jacket</a> for a packable jacket that can jam into a back pocket or a handlebar bag. These are the most roadie/racer friendly on this list, thanks to a lightweight and close fit. While it is small, don’t be fooled: This jacket is mighty in performance benefits. It uses subtle stretch panels to ensure the perfect fit, and we really appreciate the stretch at the wrists to ensure no rain coming in from between your gloves and the jacket. We also appreciate the cut: it’s shorter in the front and drops in the back to keep your butt a bit drier while optimizing aerodynamics in the front.</p><p>If you want to win your group ride, this is the jacket for you. It comes at a cost—<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgore-wear-race-shakedry-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$380</a>—but these jackets last a long time and hold up to any type of conditions. The only other potential downside: This jacket isn’t ideal off the bike because the fit has been so optimized for a riding position rather than standing, so if you’re looking for a more all-around athletic raincoat, look for one with a bit more wiggle room. It also should NOT be worn with a backpack, as it’s not abrasion-proof.</p><p>If you prefer a more colorful option, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/11/09/exclusive-rapha-pro-team-gore-tex-jackets-game-changing-shakedry-color-visibility/\">Rapha has the exclusive ability to print ShakeDry in colors</a> (at least for the time-being).</p><ul><li>Colors: Black</li><li>Sizes: XS-XL</li><li>Material: GORE ShakeDry</li><li>Weight: 172 grams</li><li>Men/Women Options: Men only, but similar women’s option is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgore-wear-c7-gore-tex-shakedry-jacket-womens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">C7 Women GORE-TEX SHAKEDRY&nbsp;</a></li><li>MSRP: $380</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Optimized for packability and perfect for aerodynamics<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Pricey<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST MTB RAINCOAT: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fspecialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Specialized Trail Series Rain Jacket</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155815/specialized-trail-best-cycling-raincoats-1536x1005.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>If you’re mountain biking, you might be less inclined to favor aerodynamics over comfort and a bit more durability.

Made with three-layer woven fabric with a laminated shell (more on that in the frequently asked questions below), the jackets are designed for breathability in addition to being waterproof.</p><p>Mountain bikers tend to prefer over the hood helmets since peripheral vision is less of an issue when shredding on singletrack versus riding busy roads. This jacket has a higher neck and a large hood with a rain visor, so if it starts pouring, you can fully cover up and avoid rain dripping down your back. The fit is much looser than a more road-focused cycling raincoat, but that makes it more comfortable on the trails as you move around—and in wet conditions, you’re more likely to be off your bike and running, so a jacket with a bit more room is helpful. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/01/29/review-specialized-trail-series-mountain-bike-kit-weathers-out-winter-mostly/\">Read the full review here</a>.</p><p>Note: While there are men’s and women’s versions available, the men’s version is pricier but comes with some upgrades, like the use of Polartec Neoshell in the fabric.</p><ul><li>Colors: Black</li><li>Sizes: XS-XXL for Women / XS-XXL for Men</li><li>Material: Women’s is Polyester / Men’s uses Polartec® Neoshell®</li><li>Men/Women Options: Yes</li><li>MSRP: Women’s $225 / Men’s $375</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great hood for trail rides in the rain<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Looser fit<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST MID RANGE: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-chrono-expert-rain-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Giro Men’s Chrono Expert Rain Jacket&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats-800x524.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats-768x503.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17155805/giro-chrome-best-cycling-raincoats-1536x1005.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-chrono-expert-rain-jacket-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrono Expert Rain Jacket</a> from Giro is a great mid-range option for someone who wants a lightweight roadie-friendly aerodynamic raincoat but can’t handle the $350+ price tag of some of the higher end options.

It’s one of the few raincoats that combine laminate waterproofing technologies with a DWR coating to maximize the amount of protection that you’ll have in the most epic of downpours.

There are also “packable” versus regular raincoats: A packable raincoat is great for occasionally getting caught in a shower while on a ride, and can be tucked into a jersey pocket. But a regular raincoat capable of withstanding any type of deluge will be a bit heavier and less foldable.</p><p><strong>Fit</strong>: Look for a coat that feels comfortable when in the position you ride in (pedal around on your bike in dry weather to test a jacket’s fit before committing to it). You shouldn’t feel restricted at all, though you do want a close fit.</p><p><strong>Pockets</strong>: Consider if you want a zippered pocket to protect your phone or to have easy access to any snacks that you would normally keep in a jersey pocket. Most higher quality coats will have at least one zippered pocket.</p><p><strong>Zippers</strong>: It’s hard to tell if a zipper is high-quality or not, but if you’re testing your coat before committing to it, make sure the zipper is easy to use and feels smooth. You may also be looking for zippers that provide ventilation, typically on the sides/underarms. These additions can make a ride much more comfortable and less sweaty.</p><div id=\"attachment_272972\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-272972\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747-297x190.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747-800x512.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747-120x77.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747-768x492.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111347/juan-rojas-wA80GXDF9uw-unsplash-scaled-e1632842204747-1536x983.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-272972\">Photo by Juan Rojas on Unsplash</p></div><p><strong>Back flap</strong>: A back flap that folds down isn’t essential, but for someone who doesn’t have a rear fender or regularly commutes using a bike share, a back flap can be a great way to protect your butt from spray coming up from your rear wheel. It’s not a perfect solution—a fender is a much better investment—but it can be a nice addition to a raincoat.</p><p><strong>Reflective accents</strong>: Like a back flap won’t replace a fender, reflective accents won’t replace having a rear or front light on your bike to improve visibility, but can help in a pinch.

But our preference is for a removable hood, since that makes a raincoat much more versatile.</p><p><strong>Packability</strong>: Again, if you’re looking for a raincoat that can stuff into a jersey pocket or a handlebar bag on your bike, look for a coat that’s lightweight and packable. If a description doesn’t mention either of those qualities, it likely won’t stuff into anything easily.</p><p><strong>Price</strong>: If you’re on a budget, there are some great options out there, but you may find that after a season, you need to invest in retreating it with a waterproofing spray. (More on that below.) Raincoats are an essential piece of gear for cyclists who want to ride in all conditions, so if you are serious about cycling, we recommend spending a bit more on a jacket that fits great and will last a long time.</p><p><strong>Returns and warranties</strong>: Check the brand’s return, repair and warranty options before you buy, especially if you’re not positive about sizing.</p><h2><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"756\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell-297x187.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell-800x504.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell-768x484.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell-696x438.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell-1068x673.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/specialized-trail-series-rain-jacket-mountain-biking-waterproof-outer-shell-667x420.jpg 667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></h2><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Cycling Raincoats</h2><p><strong>How should a cycling raincoat fit?</strong><br>It depends on how you’re using it. If you’re riding on the road or MTB and have a need for speed, then you’re going to want a raincoat that fits close to your body to minimize air resistance. But if you’re looking for a raincoat as a commuter, you want a coat that fits close to the body but allows room for your regular clothing underneath it. The temperatures you ride in are also a consideration: If you’re looking for a raincoat that you can wear in the winter, you’ll want one that can fit a cycling jacket or at least a baselayer and long-sleeve jersey underneath it while still allowing you to breathe comfortably. Don’t forget to try your raincoat on with the kit you’ll be wearing under it, and test it in the position you stay in while riding: Bent at the hips, arms bent to grab the handlebars. This can change how comfortable a jacket is, so if you’re trying one on in a store, remember that your jacket should fit best when in the cycling position, not when standing upright.</p><p><strong>Do I need a different coat for MTB versus road?</strong><br>The fit may differ slightly between the two, and a raincoat designed for road cycling will likely be a bit lighter, tighter, and a bit less burly. A mountain bike raincoat, on the other hand, will tend to be a bit thicker, since you’re more likely to bounce off of trees or take small spills on the mountain bike, and you don’t want a raincoat that’s light enough to rip as soon as you fall and land on some thorns.</p><p><strong>Do I need a women’s cycling raincoat?</strong><br>You don’t, though some women—especially those with larger chests or shorter torsos—may prefer the fit of a women’s raincoat, especially if you’re looking for a close fit.</p><p><strong>What kind of features should I look for in a cycling raincoat?</strong><br>It depends on what kind of raincoat you’re looking for. If you want one that can stuff into a jersey pocket and be used for ’emergencies,’ then focus on finding something lightweight with no bells or whistles. But if you’re looking for a raincoat that you would start a ride in, things like watertight pockets, reflective accents, and a longer back or flap that folds down can be great features.</p><p><strong>What should I do if my raincoat rips?</strong><br>While you can opt to patch it yourself with a patch kit like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UNEX4A/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this one</a>, we recommend contacting the manufacturer directly first. Some may have in-house free repairs or offer replacements depending on the situation.</p><p><strong>What does the waterproof rating mean?</strong><br>Waterproof ratings get a bit confusing. A piece of fabric is tested by hanging a tube of water over the fabric. The water is dripped onto the fabric at increasing heights, and the water’s height in millimeters when leakage through the fabric is the waterproof rating. To be considered waterproof, even the lightest of cycling raincoats must have a rating of 1500mm. But serious raincoats for stormy rides can have waterproof ratings of over 10,000mm! (Note: Not all brands provide the precise waterproof rating.)</p><p><strong>Why would I want a lower waterproof rating?</strong><br>Remember, air and water go in both directions. If a jacket is ultra-waterproof, it means it won’t be as breathable, so if you’re a heavy sweater or riding in warm conditions, you might want a rain jacket that is more breathable, even if it’s less watertight.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111541/shutterstock_3492643011-1536x1025-1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111541/shutterstock_3492643011-1536x1025-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111541/shutterstock_3492643011-1536x1025-1.jpeg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111541/shutterstock_3492643011-1536x1025-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111541/shutterstock_3492643011-1536x1025-1-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111541/shutterstock_3492643011-1536x1025-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28111541/shutterstock_3492643011-1536x1025-1-768x513.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px\"></a></p><p><strong>What’s the deal with DWR versus laminate?</strong><br>Here’s the deal: Durable Water Repellent (DWR) treatments are applied to fabric to make a fabric more waterproof. They degrade over time, which is why you may need to retreat some raincoats after many wears and washes. You may see some random numbers noted when brands talk about their DWR fabrics, like 30/50. What that means is that after 50 washes (the second number), the DWR is about 30 percent as effective as it was when it was new. Of course, you won’t be washing your raincoat often, so don’t panic that your raincoat has only 50 uses before it stops being water-resistant!</p><p>A laminate, on the other hand, is a physical thin layer of cover that’s applied to the surface of a fabric. It’s either teflon or polyurethane, and typically lasts longer than a DWR treatment because it’s glued over top of the fabric. Many use two or three layers of laminate to add more protection.</p><p><strong>Are there any good eco-friendly DWR treatments to re-treat rain gear?</strong><br><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/09/08/endura-pfc-free-dwr-treatment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Endura’s PFC-Free Re-Proofer</a> is a new entry to the market as brands try to eliminate perfluorochemicals, a group of synthetic chemicals known for water and oil repellency, from their product lines. Nikwax is another great option that also avoids using the harmful chemicals while still making gear more waterproof. We recently tried Endura’s&nbsp;eco-friendly DWR spray and found it was&nbsp;a great way to breathe new life into rainwear that’s started to get a little less waterproof than it used to be.</p><p><strong>Do I need a hood?</strong><br>We like a jacket that has a removable hood because, to be honest, hoods can be more trouble than they’re worth. Some hoods are large enough to wear over your helmet—like the Chrome Storm Seeker for commuters—but in most situations, you wouldn’t want to block your peripheral vision. Some people opt to wear them under a helmet, but that can be uncomfortable and may minimize vision. And of course, a hood will add to the overall weight of a coat and make it less packable. Still, a hood can be nice, especially if you’re also wearing the jacket off the bike. For instance, you may wear a rain jacket while warming up at a cyclocross race without the hood, and then want to put a hood up while you stand and spectate after your race is done. A removable hood provides the best of both worlds—but ultimately, don’t stress if your raincoat of choice doesn’t have one.</p><p><strong>Do I need to bring a cycling raincoat on every ride?</strong><br>It’s probably not worth bringing one along on a summer ride unless you’re expecting storms… Getting caught in a shower is just one of the many joys of being out on the bike! But if temperatures are below 65ºF, you should bring one if there’s a good chance of rain. While 65ºF may not seem too chilly, if you’re riding quickly on the road and you’re soaked, it can feel quite cold!</p></section></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"73c03360d4f40dc67960deeea438a7b4c56d37cb31a2f0905644b18a4608d1e3","category":"Cycling"}
