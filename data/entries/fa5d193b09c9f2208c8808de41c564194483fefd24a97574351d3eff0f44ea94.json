Eagle 90 and Eagle 70 are the long-awaited, much-rumored direct-mount mechanical SRAM Transmission drivetrains. Ever since <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/sram/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a> launched wireless Transmission in 2023, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a> has been eagerly awaiting this news. And the news is good … mostly.</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Among all the excitement and vitriol following the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-eagle-transmission-stealth-brake-review/\" target=\"_blank\">launch of the SRAM Eagle AXS Transmission</a> drivetrains, there were many hopeful calls for a cable-actuated version. A lot of the advantages of the sturdy, direct-mount Transmission concept have nothing to do with it being wireless. And a few of the disadvantages are straight-up <i>because</i> it’s wireless.</p>\n<p>A programming feature designed to improve shifting under load (which, not coincidentally, is hard to avoid on e-MTBs) would intentionally delay the derailleur’s movements on smaller cogs that have fewer shift ramps. Then there’s the need to regularly recharge batteries, the potential for phantom glitches, and of course, the price. Depending on your priorities, a mechanical SRAM Transmission drivetrain would be a home run.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-20.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-20.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-19.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-19.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/EP3556643B1/en?q=(derailleur)&amp;assignee=sram&amp;oq=sram+derailleur\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM’s 2019 US patent application</a> for their direct-mount derailleur clearly featured a cable pulley. Mechanical Transmission seemed inevitable, but “mechanical” (or as I was saying, “cable-actuated”) could mean a lot of things. Will it be built as affordable as possible, or would it be aimed at the ultra-high-end? Could ditching the motor allow it to slim down, or would it opt to bulk up? Would the shifter change? Would installation change? Will it be backwards-compatible? “Mechanical Transmission” just isn’t very specific. It’s like saying “tubeless tire,” or for that matter, “direct-mount derailleur.” There are still a lot of variables. Although Eagle 90 and the lower-priced Eagle 70 deliver what I asked for, they weren’t exactly what I expected. So, let’s get into it.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical SRAM Transmission Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Available in two price points: Eagle 90 and Eagle 70</li>\n<li>Cassettes, chains, and cranks are interchangeable with wireless AXS Transmission</li>\n<li>Not compatible with non-Transmission Eagle shifter, cassette, chain, or chainring</li>\n<li>Designed for a 55mm chainline</li>\n<li>No limit screws, no traditional B-tension adjustment</li>\n<li>Clearly defined rules for installation and setup, similar to wireless Transmission</li>\n<li>Rebuildable, serviceable derailleur (Eagle 90 is more rebuildable than Eagle 70)</li>\n<li>Eagle 90 weights (tested)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Derailleur: 389 g</li>\n<li>Cassette: 449 g</li>\n<li>Shifter: 132 g</li>\n<li>Chain (126 links): 285 g</li>\n<li>Crank (170mm, with two bash guards): 815 g</li>\n<li>Total: 2,070 g</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Price</h3>\n<p>I opened <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-gx-transmission-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">my review of GX AXS Transmission</a> with its price, so why mess with tradition. Plus, it’ll help put everything else about Eagle 90 and Eagle 70 in context. Some of the components meant to be paired with 90 and 70 already exist within other Transmission (also known as “T-Type”) product families, so not everything listed here is brand new. Also, I didn’t include the e-MTB variations, and there are a lot of spare parts worth knowing about. So, in this article’s Gallery section, I’ll post SRAM’s exhaustive price list, including EUR and GBP pricing. But the highlights in USD are below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-41.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-41.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-41.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-41.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>SRAM Eagle 90 Pricing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Derailleur: $190</li>\n<li>Shifter: $50</li>\n<li>Crankset w/ two bash guards: $155</li>\n<li>Chain (existing GX Eagle T-Type): $50</li>\n<li>Cassette (existing GX Eagle T-Type) $250</li>\n<li>Eagle 90 Groupset: $670</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-42.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-42.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>SRAM Eagle 70 Pricing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Derailleur: $125</li>\n<li>Shifter: $30</li>\n<li>Crankset w/ two bash guards: $90</li>\n<li>Chain: $30</li>\n<li>Cassette (Existing XS1270 T-Type) $215</li>\n<li>Total: $490 (no package pricing available from SRAM on an Eagle 70 groupset</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For comparison, here is the pricing for the wireless GX Transmission group.

I’ll cover the details later, but the Eagle 90’s full parallelogram can be disassembled, while the inner plate of the Eagle 70’s parallelogram can not be removed. The outer skid plates, chain pulleys, and the complete pulley cage or just the inner cage plate on each derailleur can be replaced. The Eagle 70’s inner parallelogram plate is stamped steel, while the 90’s is forged aluminum. And finally, the 70 uses a new, simpler Drag Spring damper for chain retention, while the 90 uses the same clutch found on the GX, XO, and XX T-Type derailleurs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-40-e1742947997795.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-40-e1742947997795.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-40-e1742947997795.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-40-e1742947997795.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-45-e1743004109668.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-45-e1743004109668.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-45-e1743004109668.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-45-e1743004109668.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Shifter</strong>: Although OEM customers (bike companies) may choose different clamp options to spec on their complete builds, aftermarket Eagle 90 shifters will mount in the Matchmaker X style, while Eagle 70 shifters use an integrated 22.2mm clamp.

The smallest four cogs are machined from a single piece of steel, while the other eight cogs are pinned together and the largest cog is aluminum. Eagle 70 uses the existing XS-1270 Transmission cassette, which fits a traditional HG freehub body, but still has a 12-speed 10-52 range. Its smallest five cogs are on a removable, replaceable assembly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<p>Transmission 12-speed drivetrains are not the same as SRAM’s traditional 12-speed drivetrains. The T-type chain has a slightly different shape, and the chainring has slightly different tooth profiles. The Transmission chainring is bumped out to offer a mandatory 55 mm chainline, and the cassette bumped out to reduce cross-chaining. But none of that changed with the introduction of Eagle 90 and 70, which means you can intermix any T-Type chain, cassette, and chainring with any T-type derailleur, whether it’s electronic or mechanical.</p>\n<p>The only things to remember on that topic are that the Eagle 70 crank uses a 3-bolt ring while all the other existing Transmission chainrings use an 8-bolt. And the Eagle 70 cassette uses a traditional HG freehub body while Eagle 90 uses XD. On this topic, I was a bit disappointed that SRAM didn’t introduce a stamped steel, 0mm-offset, three-bolt T-Type chainring. That would allow most current SRAM drivetrain users to get a Transmission-compatible chainline and tooth profile by buying a $20 chainring, not $155 cranks. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wolf-tooth-drop-stop-b-0mm-chainring-sram-transmission-review/\">But there’s always Wolf Tooth.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-16.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-16.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-17.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-17.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Eagle 90 and 70 shifters pull a different amount of cable than the existing Eagle shifters. It’s a natural result of the drastically different shape of this derailleur. There wasn’t a way to engineer around the specific cable pull of each click on the old shifter. And I get it. The t-type derailleur has a pretty unique structure, and structure is important here. My main nitpick is that the new mechanical SRAM Transmission shifter pulls <i>less</i> cable per shift. It’s not much. I measured a decrease of barely 2.5 mm in the full pull across all 12 gears, from 38.6 mm down to 36.1 mm. If you’re curious, I measured a Shimano 12-speed shifter to pull a total of 36.4 mm.</p>\n<p>This a minor complaint, but I don’t have many, so hear me out. On any cable-actuated system, when friction builds up in the housing and the cable needs to be put under more tension to perform a shift, the resulting tiny bit of stretch can eventually impact shifting accuracy. That friction and stretch are why you need to replace your housing once in a while, and shorter cable pull means you may have to do it more frequently. That said, I’ve had no issues so far, and I experienced no finickeyness during setup.</p>\n<p>Within the derailleur itself, there are some nice quality-of-life compatibilities. The chain pulleys are compatible across all Transmission derailleurs. And so are the pulley <i>cages</i>, with the exception of the Eagle 70 because of its use of a Drag Spring instead of a clutch. That means you could trick out an Eagle 90 derailleur with an XX SL’s carbon pulley cage to save weight if you wanted.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Rebuildability</h3>\n<p>A Transmission derailleur’s pulley-cage replacement process is pretty simple. Looking at the back of the derailleur, you just rotate it counter-clockwise, and it unscrews, bringing out the clutch mechanism with it. But derailleur pulley cages have been replaceable for decades. What’s truly fascinating is the fact that <em>nearly everything else</em> is replaceable, too. Much more so than the electronic Transmission derailleurs, which are limited because of how intimately the motor is integrated. The Eagle 90 mechanical SRAM Transmission derailleur can be pretty much taken down to the studs, with the Eagle 70 coming pretty close.</p>\n<p>This was one of those aspects of a mechanical SRAM Transmission drivetrain that I did not expect, and it’s one that can not be overstated. The rebuildable derailleur is the flying cars of mountain biking. It’s been promised to us since I first started riding, but no attempt has ever stuck around. This one likely will.</p>\n<p>As with the electronic derailleurs, you can replace the composite skid plates that may help deflect the derailleur in an impact. And on the Eagle 70, you can also replace the outer link of the parallelogram. But on the Eagle 90, yu can replace the entire B-knuckle assembly. That includes the inner and outer mounting plates and the “knuckle” that connects them to the top half of parallelogram, plus the housing stop and cable pulley. The B-knuckle assembly is sold together as one kit. Opposite that is the P-knuckle assembly, which is what houses the clutch and connects to the bottom half of the parallelogram. In between, you can replace the inner or outer parallelogram individually, and in a pretty clever way.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-09.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-09.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>You don’t do it by removing the pivot pins. They’re fixed pretty firmly in the knuckles. Instead, both parallelogram plates are made of two interlocking pieces. The bushings pressed into the tips of those plates slide over those embedded pivot pins, and two bolts hold the interlocking pieces together. And of course, all eight bushings are replaceable, too. The one-piece inner plate of the Eagle 70 isn’t removable, which means the B- and P-knuckles aren’t either, but the outer plate is, along with the four bushings it runs on.</p>\n<p>Disassembly and reassembly took me less than ten minutes the very first time I did it. The whole process is really elegant, but I think the replaceable bushings are The Fact of the Day. Usually, if my derailleur doesn’t die a violent death, it dies a slow, painful one as the pivots loosen up. Of course, the size and shape of the Transmission derailleur—mechanical <i>and</i> electronic—may make violent deaths more likely than on a more traditional, more <em>compact</em> derailleur.</p>\n<p>The P-knuckle assembly is big and square, so any impact the derailleur can’t fully juke its way around will get absorbed by the derailleur itself. And the rather long pulley cage is angled outward to help smoothly onboard the chain while pedaling, making it more a bit more likely to catch an edge as well. Knock on wood, I’ve had no catastrophic impacts after nearly two years of riding mostly Transmission bikes. But it does happen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-11.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-11.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Both the P-knuckle and B-knuckle on both 90 and 70 derailleurs are composite, which in casual conversation, some might call “plastic.” But parts like these have materials mixed in that make them significantly stronger than, say, a toothbrush. And it’s actually quite common. My Shimano M8100 XT derailleur has a composite lower “P-knuckle,” though that’s not what Shimano calls it. Sure, the XT derailleur’s upper assembly is all aluminum, but a T-Type derailleur has those two aluminum plates sandwiching its composite B-knuckle, so I’d say it’s plenty burly.</p>\n<p>An all-aluminum structure would have been cool, I struggle to find a logical reason why it would be any better. I’ve shredded at least one XT derailleur cage after it went into my spokes, but the composite part looked fine afterward. And if we’re talking about a rock strike, I can’t picture what scenario would destroy composite, but leave aluminum unharmed. Plus, Eagle 90 and 70 derailleurs have a lot of surface area holding their pivot pins into the knuckles. I don’t picture them loosening up. Those bushings will probably see the most wear, which is why they’re replaceable. Depending on your take on the whole <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus\" target=\"_blank\">Ship of Theseus paradox,</a> there’s a chance this derailleur could last forever.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Mechanical SRAM Transmission Installation and setup</h3>\n<p>Because SRAM knows the exact shapes and relative positions of the derailleur and the cassette in a Transmission drivetrain, they can offer pretty universal installation instructions. The only variables are chainstay length and chainring size. You enter your bike’s make, model, and frame size in the Transmission Setup Guide, add your chainring size, and it will tell you how long your chain should be and how to configure the derailleur when tightening it to your frame. It’s a crucial process because the Transmission derailleur doesn’t have a traditional B-gap/B-tension adjustment, and B-gap has to be right on wide-range cassettes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re already experienced at installing a traditional derailleur, this new method will probably be frustrating. I didn’t like it at first, but it became second-nature after doing it a couple times. It’s <i>easier</i> on a wireless drivetrain, though. There are some extra steps when a cable is involved. There’s a port underneath the parallelogram where, depending on what the Setup Guide instructs, you’ll insert either a 4mm or 5mm allen wrench. This holds the derailleur at one of the two “setup cogs,” ensuring you end up with the correct B-gap when tightening the derailleur.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-14.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-14.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Then, you set your cable tension pretty much like you would any normal derailleur. That process can be a little tricky in a repair stand because most of the Transmission cassette cogs have narrow-wide tooth profiles like a 1x chainring. Sometimes when gently hand-cranking the pedals during an in-the-repair-stand derailleur adjustment, the chain will jump to the next gear and the links won’t “sync” with the teeth. The slightest bit of load will pull the chain over and everything will sync, so you don’t notice it on the ground. But you do notice it on the stand.</p>\n<p>I still had an easy time tweaking the barrel adjuster to dial it in, but it’s just that much more important to do a parking-lot spin after it’s out of the stand. The only other difference is that there are no adjustable limit screws. Again, because SRAM always knows where everything’s at, there isn’t a a need for them to ever move. But there are “gates” built into the structure that will keep you from overshifting. I never pushed the chain into the spokes. So far, so good.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-13.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Other Details</h3>\n<p>While developing Eagle 90 and 70, SRAM took a close look at what causes cable friction. Like, is a long gradual bend better than a short, tight one? Or how many bends does it take to start impacting shift quality? They quantified the effects that various routing geometries had on cable friction, and actually gave several bike models a “grade” based on how smooth their routing is. SRAM has even given brands advice on how they could change their routing to decrease friction.</p>\n<p>I don’t expect there to ever be a consumer-facing database of results, but I bet my Giant Trance got docked a few points. It routes the housing out of the underside of the chainstay where it has to loop sharply back up again to enter from above the derailleur. All the other bikes in my living room route out of the top of the chainstay. My nitpick about Eagle 90 and 70’s shorter cable-pull remains, but it’s nice to see SRAM taking a whole-bike approach to drivetrain design.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There’s also a couple design tweaks in the shifter. You don’t have to pull the cover off to replace the cable. It just slides in the back, Shimano-style. A little less welcomed is the switch to a maximum of two downshift clicks per thumb-lever swing. That’s compared to five downshifts on the XO shifter I replaced it with. This isn’t necessarily an E-MTB concession, since there’s also a single-downshift version specifically for the motorized market. It’s a way to help every Transmission drivetrain deliver on the promise of shifting under load. Preventing the chain from tracking across too many gears at a time will increase the chances that it’ll hit its shift ramps and maintain power.</p>\n<p>SRAM told me they studied this topic as well, monitoring riders’ shifting behavior, and found that downshifting two gears at a time was by far the most common action, with three- and four-shift moments happening far less frequently. It also means you’re not reaching back quite as far to hit the lever, though I think that’s better to cover when I finally start talking about how mechanical SRAM Transmission rides.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-44.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>How Mechanical SRAM Transmission Rides</h3>\n<p>Just to set a baseline, I should start by saying that Eagle 90 feels like a “premium” drivetrain. I’m not using that word to <i>praise</i> it, necessarily. More like to <i>categorize</i> it. Mechanical SRAM Transmission is on par with what you would expect if you spend a combined cost of $240 for derailleur and shifter. The action is neither soft nor crunchy. While visiting Sram’s Vancouver HQ, I even did a North-Shore loop with the composite<i>–</i>levered Eagle 70 shifter, and I completely forgot I was on the cheap stuff. And as someone who’s been spoiled by the tiny thumb motions required to shift an electronic drivetrain, I actually appreciated the slightly shorter lever throw that resulted from Eagle 90’s limited downshifts. But whether or not that’s a worthwhile tradeoff is more a question of function than of feel.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-15.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I think I have to divide function up into two criteria: How it shifts under load, versus how it shifts under <em>no</em> load. Most of us have learned to ease up on the power when we shift. I definitely have. Two years on wireless Transmission drivetrains won’t undo thirty years of good behavior. And carrying that good behavior back and forth between Eagle 90 and an XT Shimano 12-speed drivetrain, I found I could get across the cassette a lot quicker with Shimano because of its multiple downshifts. Side note: Shimano is still the only brand offering multiple <i>upshifts</i> per (cable-actuated) stroke.</p>\n<p>What did surprise me, though, was that, during the three-ish weeks I’ve been riding Eagle 90, I can’t remember a single moment when the two-downshift maximum created a real problem on the trail. I mean, I still don’t like it. I’d rather sacrifice a half second of poor thumb ergonomics in order to sneak in a couple more gears per throw. When the trail grade shifted drastically, I often had to crank that lever twice to reach the right gear. But those were scenarios where my lizard brain was in full control. As much as I want to criticize, the truth is I always just made it happen without ever being stuck in the wrong gear after I ran out of momentum. That included that wet and foggy day on The North Shore where the climbs are a bit more rowdy and techy than here in sunny southern California.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-43.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The second reason I never had an issue might be thanks to the other criterion: Shifting under load. I still insist on avoiding it when possible, but Eagle 90 always quietly forgave me whenever I got back on the power before I “should” have. And taking that into account, the <i>effective net difference</i> between Eagle 90 and XT’s shifting time starts to shrink. When I was bulk-downshifting as late as possible into a sudden uphill, followed by mashing the pedal <em>as soon as possible</em>, it never ended with me grinding to a halt.</p>\n<p>I’m spending a lot of time talking about a type of shift that’s comparatively rare. I perform a lot more small adjustments than huge swings. Eagle 90 handles unloaded small adjustments fine, but so should any drivetrain, premium or not. But it starts to stand out when those small adjustments happen under load. Transmission is not only capable of it. It’s made for it. That’s been all over SRAM’s messaging about wireless Transmission. And Eagle 90 does it just as well, as long as you account for the extra time it takes to physically pull a metal cable.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-46.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-46.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-46.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-46.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If SRAM wants to stand by that selling point, I can see why they capped downshifts at just two. Trying to jam three or four shifts under load would always work (and sound) just like I expected: Not good. But performing one or two shifts under heavy pedaling force will work (and sound) as if that’s simply how it’s supposed to be done. I said similar things back in 2018 when I rode 12-speed Shimano for the first time, but I’m gonna say Eagle 90 makes the once unholy act of shifting under load feel almost divine.</p>\n<p>I guess there is a third criterion: Durability. And I don’t just mean durable as in you-can-stand-on-it. I mean durable as in <i>lasting performance</i>. Something I appreciate about my wireless Transmission drivetrain is that I’ve never had to think about it. I’ve never had a gremlin pop up after reinstalling my rear wheel. Or felt a nagging shifting hesitation after my bike tipped over on a windy day. As much as I love wide-range 12-speed cassettes, I don’t love how finicky they are when it comes to derailleur precision.</p>\n<p>Someday, I’m sure I’ll drive the broad side of a Transmission derailleur into an immovable object, and no amount of you-can-stand-on it will help. And hell, maybe no amount of rebuildability will either. But that’s just not the type of drivetrain problem I most frequently deal with. I most frequently deal with the little things. Like the alignment issues I just mentioned. Or neglecting to change worn-out housing … or to recharge a battery.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-SRAM-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-drivetrain-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That’s what’s so exciting about finally having a mechanical SRAM Transmission drivetrain on the market. You have another choice. Sure, that choice comes with compromise, but so does every single other choice you could possibly make. Even though the wireless drivetrain on my mountain bike may someday leave me stuck in one gear walking uphill for miles, its advantages are worth it. Even though the traditional drivetrain on my touring bike sometimes has me reaching for a Hanger Alignment Gauge, its advantages are worth it.
