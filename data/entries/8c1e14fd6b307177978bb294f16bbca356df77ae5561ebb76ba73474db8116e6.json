The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-max-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15 lineup</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2</a>, and releases of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1794980/ipados-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 10</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>October is often a little more muted, but we usually have the new macOS release and even some new Macs to look forward to. This year, the macOS release came earlier in September and the release of new Macs is in question. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll still get some nice OS updates, new Apple TV+ shows, and Apple Arcade games, but it could very well be that all the big releases for the year are behind us and we shouldn’t expect another big drop from Apple until the spring of 2024! Here’s what we expect from Apple in October 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 10/03/23:</strong> Apple finally updated the Apple Arcade Coming Soon section with the games to be released this month, so we have updated our list.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With rumors of a new M3 chip on the way, we have been preparing for a second Apple event in October focused on the Mac. However, recent rumors suggest Apple isn’t planning to hold an event though there still could be “a few press releases,” <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/leaksapplepro/status/1707848884943237446&amp;xcust=1-1-2084105-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">according to LeaksApplePro on X</a> (formerly Twitter). That likely means Apple has some new products to launch before the year is up:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M3 Macs</strong>: Previously, it was rumored that Apple would release the first of its M3-based Macs in October. This might include an updated iMac with M3 and processor, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">MacBook Air with M3</a>, with not much expected to change other than the processors. But recent rumors have cast that in double, with analyst Ming-Chi Kuo saying he doesn’t expect any iPads or Macs with M3 chips this year at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad mini 7:</strong> The most recent rumors of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">7th-generation iPad mini</a> still say it’s coming this fall. Without many other products to announce, and with no major new features expected other than an updated processor, it’s likely this would be released directly to the web with little fanfare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods:</strong> We don’t know what Apple is planning for the AirPods and AirPods Max, both of which still have Lightning ports. After the USB-C case arrived for the AirPods Pro alongside the iPhone 15, Apple likely has a refresh in store at some point. Still, if these were ready to come in October, they probably would have been announced at the September event, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All the big yearly new software releases are out, including macOS Somona, making the first time macOS was released in September 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re on to the point-release updates now, which are usually quite substantial for the first few months, as Apple finishes adding all the features promised at WWDC in June that didn’t quite make the initial release. The x.1 versions of all the operating systems entered beta at the end of September, and will probably see public release in October. Beta testing on the x.2 releases will probably start in October, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS/iPadOS 17.1:</strong> Adds some new Apple Music features, continuing AirDrop transfers over the internet, and other minor improvements. More could be added before its final release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Sonoma 14.1:</strong> The “favorite” feature comes to Apple Music, and there are fixes for Remote Widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.

He authored famous espionage novels like <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em>, <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>, <em>The Night Manager</em>, and <em>The Constant Gardener</em>. <strong>October 20</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Enfield Poltergeist:</strong> The chilling true story of the world’s most famous poltergeist case through original audio recordings made inside the house as the events unfolded. <strong>October 27</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Arcade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple releases new games to Apple Arcade on Fridays, but not every Friday is marked by a new game or significant update.
