But the interior build quality needs work.

Plug-in hybrids are finding their second wind, as automakers and regulators look to PHEVs as a way to reduce transport-related carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>Lincoln's Corsair Grand Touring is not a particularly new PHEV, but since we hadn't tested one yet and there was an example on the local press fleet, it seemed prudent to schedule a week with this compact crossover from one of America's luxury brands.</p>\n<p>The first thing to note is that, despite the way it might look in photos, this is not a huge land barge. The Corsair is 181.4 inches (4,608 mm) long, 76.4 inches (1,941 mm) wide, and 64.1 inches (1,628 mm) tall, so about the same size as a Toyota RAV4, or six inches shorter than a Tesla Model Y. The shape uses plenty of curved edges, dominated by the large Lincoln grille up front, with a hint of late-teens Audi SUV to it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011994#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011994&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
