Apple details the eligibility criteria for developers applying to use the API in a new <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/\">support document</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's announcement appears to be part of a broader effort to refine its ‌App Store‌ policies following scrutiny, particularly in the European Union. This particular API appears to be a direct response to challenges faced by apps with unconventional monetization models, such as Patreon, an online platform that enables creators to offer paid memberships to their audiences. In 2022, Apple required Patreon to adopt the ‌App Store‌'s billing system for in-app purchases.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/apple-announces-new-in-app-purchase-api/\">Apple Announces New In-App Purchase API</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-new-in-app-purchase-api.2448025/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"093fde48cbb3eb997c6694c68605af4855d1d976800ad867a1b2369c6b1b1416","category":"Apple"}
