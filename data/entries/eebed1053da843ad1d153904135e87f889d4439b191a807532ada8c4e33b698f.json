{"title":"iOS 15: How to Drag and Drop Screenshots","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/drag-and-drop-screenshots-ios/","date":1626175809000,"content":"In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, Apple has expanded support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/12/ios-15-drag-and-drop-across-apps/\">drag and drop functionality</a> across apps on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, allowing you to move files, images, and selected chunks of text from place to place. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/ios-15-home-screen-icons-yellow.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCross-app drag and drop has actually been available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> since 2017, but now Apple has extended the feature to the ‌iPhone‌ with ‌iOS 15‌. In addition to apps, the multi-finger action also works with screenshots. The following steps show you how it works.\r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li>Take a screenshot in the usual way, by pressing the <strong>Side button</strong> and the <strong>Volume Up button</strong> at the same time.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Press and hold on the screenshot thumbnail in the bottom-left corner of the screen, and wait a moment for the white frame around it to disappear.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>With another finger, tap the app that you want to use the screenshot in. We're opening the <strong>Photos</strong> app in our example, but you could open Files, Messages, Mail, Notes, or something else.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/save-screenshots-different-locations-ios.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>Navigate to where you want to use the screenshot. We're selecting a specific album we created, called \"‌iOS 15‌ screenshots.\"</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Move the screenshot into the area you want it, then <strong>let go with your finger</strong> to drop it in place. In our example, the screenshots are instantly saved in the specified location.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/save-screenshots-different-locations-ios-1.jpg\" /></li></ol>You may have noticed that we've dragged two screenshots in our example – that's just a \"meta\" result of capturing screenshots of the screenshot-taking process (the thumbnail of the earlier screenshot remains in the next). However, it also serves to highlight that drag and drop supports the selection of multiple items by tapping them with another finger. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's worth noting that drag and drop results in duplication rather than movement of content, so the screenshot still gets automatically saved in your camera roll, but now you have the ability to immediately pick up a copy of it and do with it what you want.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first public beta of ‌iOS 15‌ is available now, and the official release should come to all compatible iPhones in September.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/drag-and-drop-screenshots-ios/\">iOS 15: How to Drag and Drop Screenshots</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-how-to-drag-and-drop-screenshots.2304105/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V_oQIj799SU:gQnC_4MpFZk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V_oQIj799SU:gQnC_4MpFZk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/V_oQIj799SU\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eebed1053da843ad1d153904135e87f889d4439b191a807532ada8c4e33b698f","category":"Apple"}
