Programming hasn’t fundamentally changed in a long time. Building an app usually means searching for the right component library, debugging dependencies, rewriting a lot of boilerplate code, and figuring out where and how to deploy. Everything but solving the problem at hand.</p>\n\n<p>Retool is a new approach, unifying the ease of visual programming with the power and flexibility of real code. Connect to any database or API. Use drag-and-drop to design your UI while simultaneously live-programming it. Deploy instantly and scale as you grow. You can use Retool to build web apps, native iOS and Android apps, and automated workflows to help your business run.</p>\n\n<p>Retool’s customers use it to solve all kinds of business problems 10× faster: Plaid uses Retool to manage integration product support. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. You, too, can use it to manage users and orders, analyze data, run developer operations, or build any other business-critical application, fast. <a href=\"https://retool.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball\">Start building for free today</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/11/retool\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d2912f100303dbfd59683dac9f619a92bb62f1b96025d07b8150e8f9af1fb049","category":"Tech"}
