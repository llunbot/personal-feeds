{"title":"Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro: Closed Studio Headphones","link":"https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/p/dt-770-pro","date":1742408539000,"content":"\n<p>Ten years ago I bought a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro headphones for use while podcasting. My product research was rigorous and exhaustive: I asked Marco Arment which headphones I should buy, he said these, so I bought them. They’re offered in three impedance variants: 32, 80, and 250 ohms. Beyerdynamics describes 80 ohms as the best “allrounder” choice, and that’s what Marco told me to get.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve since worn them to record at least 275 episodes of The Talk Show (I think <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/07/29/ep-127\">this episode</a> was the first) and nearly all of the five-years-and-counting run of Dithering. They sound great, but more importantly, they’re super comfortable. I can wear them for 3+ hours and my ears don’t feel too bad at all. They’re also built to last. Just about everything on mine still looks fairly new, despite my having worn them for something approaching 1,000 hours. No cracking on the cable and the padding on the headband looks new. The one part that <em>didn’t</em> look new were the velour ear pads. Last week I ordered <a href=\"https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/p/edt-770-v\">replacements from Beyerdynamics for $40</a>; they arrived earlier this week and I swapped the old pads for new today.</p>\n\n<p>When I bought my headphones in 2015, they cost $250. Today the price is down to just $170, either <a href=\"https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/p/dt-770-pro\">direct from Beyerdynamic</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MNAAI?tag=df-amzn-20\">from Amazon</a> (that’s a make-me-rich affiliate link). I am not an audiophile, and I literally only use mine for podcasting. But I’ve spent quite a lot time podcasting with them over the last decade. I’ll bet I’m still using the same pair (with another set of fresh ear pads) 10 years from now.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bf94f97a050b463eb13588d8f33ce4fd4e263669f68aaf5749e7f7479e0d4699","category":"Tech"}
