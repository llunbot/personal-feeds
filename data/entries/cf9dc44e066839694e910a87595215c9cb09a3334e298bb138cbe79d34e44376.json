While Cari and John were in Melbourne at <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/made-bike-show-australia-2024-show-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\">MADE OZ</a>, they picked up V 2.70 of this bag and used it on bike rides, bush walks, and city sightseeing. The V 2.70 of the <a href=\"https://www.huuungry.com.au/shop/p/big-lunch-v-270\" target=\"_blank\">Big Lunch</a> features the Big Fidlock closure system, making entry to the bag a cinch and the massive roll top allows you to stuff it full of all sorts of stuff. Best of all, the straps tuck into the padding and you can mount it to your handlebars with ease. There’s even a secure zippered pouch accessible without having to unroll the roll-top.</p>\n<p>All this to say we’ve got a bag problem and Hungry has our fix.
