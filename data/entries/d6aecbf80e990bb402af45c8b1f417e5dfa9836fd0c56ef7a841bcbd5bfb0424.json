All three cases against the FCC were filed by <a href=\"https://consumersresearch.org/\">Consumers' Research</a>, a nonprofit that fights \"woke corporations,\" and a mobile virtual network operator called <a href=\"https://www.causebasedcommerce.com/\">Cause Based Commerce</a>, which offers wireless service to \"values-based consumers who want alternatives to the many companies and providers that support causes and positions contrary to their beliefs.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039246#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039246&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6aecbf80e990bb402af45c8b1f417e5dfa9836fd0c56ef7a841bcbd5bfb0424","category":"Tech"}
