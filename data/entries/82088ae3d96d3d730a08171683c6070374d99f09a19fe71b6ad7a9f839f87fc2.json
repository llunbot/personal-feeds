A challenging area for riding, the only road access is via a descent of the unpaved Heckman Pass, with pitches as steep as 18% along its 1,500-metre vertical drop.</p>\n<p>In this episode of Reconnecting, Svein discusses his need to roam, the perils of comfort, and the benefits of finding flat ground. While riding through the searing heat of a record-setting summer, Svein also reveals how bikepacking helped him find new motivation during his racing career, and tells the story of his first star-crossed ride to Bella Coola as a young man. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/svein-tuft-rides-to-the-heart-of-the-great-bear-rainforest/\">Read More</a>","author":"7mesh","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"82088ae3d96d3d730a08171683c6070374d99f09a19fe71b6ad7a9f839f87fc2","category":"Cycling"}
