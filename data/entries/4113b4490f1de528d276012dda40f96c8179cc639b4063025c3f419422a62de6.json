Important emails are displayed in the Primary category, with other emails organized into sections highlighting product orders, newsletters, deals, and social notifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA \"Transactions\" section aggregates receipts, orders, and deliveries to make it easy to find orders that you've placed and shipping information for those orders.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an \"Updates\" section, you'll find newsletters, alerts for doctor's appointments and correspondence, and subscription emails. A \"Promotions\" category includes emails with offers and deals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCategories is the default view after updating to the new software, but in the upper right corner of the Mail app, you can swap back to a list view that shows all emails in chronological order, without separation into categories. Devices that have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support will show priority emails in the Primary inbox, so you can see what's most important first.
