Our resident hosts James Spender and Will Strickson bring in a new guest every two weeks to give an exclusive insight into the world of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent episodes include some big hitter names, including Tour de France champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, Q36.5’s new recruit <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tom-pidcock-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a> and Classics superstar of old<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/fabian-cancellara-podcast\" target=\"_blank\"> Fabian Cancellara</a>. The guests aren’t restricted to road pros, James and Will have chatted to figures at the forefront of cycling, whether that be sports scientists, TV broadcasters or aerodynamic experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some episodes of the podcast are now available to view on YouTube on the <em>Cyclist</em> channel.

Now hosted by the knowledgable Daniel Friebe, the weekly podcast covers all the hottest news stories in the peloton, discussing the hard-hitting topics alongside top-shelf guests including Eurosport commentator <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-biggest-problem-in-our-business-is-ego-rob-hatch-qa\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Hatch</a>, seasoned French journalist François Thomazeau and Tudor Pro Cycling’s Larry Warbasse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The podcast appears daily during the Grand Tours, following their trials and tribulations, tapping into the feel-good stories, local history and behind-the-scenes actors on the sport’s biggest stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking the same in-depth approach to the women’s calendar, the Cycling Podcast Féminin was one of the few outlets covering the women’s racing scene with serious depth. Topics range from expanding the women’s calendar to the finances of running a team, and other journalists, managers and officials often make for some of the most interesting guests. Despite this wealth of knowledge to call on, neither edition seems inclined to stretch its playing time beyond what the subject requires, making for a punchy listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen <a href=\"https://thecyclingpodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lael-wilcox-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast: Lael Wilcox, the fastest woman around the world by bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/michael-crawley-endurance-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast: Why we do it? with Dr Michael Crawley</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/andy-schleck-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 121: Andy Schleck on Chaingate, Contador, Bruyneel, doping and the brotherhood</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-cycling-books\">The best cycling books 2025 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-best-cycling-documentaries\">The best cycling documentaries 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>3.

Five years down the line, the two have stuck at it, now with Luke Rowe as a retired pro working at Decathlon-AG2R as a sports director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few years, the two have shared their surprisingly unfiltered opinions on the sport, even nicknaming <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> ‘the little bastard’. Their off-the-cuff discussions often feature the insights of teammates and peloton rivals, giving a rare insight into the real-life workings of the pro peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a team caricatured as lacking personality, Watts Occurring’s presenters are always good company, meaning the podcast should have appeal beyond fans of the squad.

Co-hosted by YouTubers Patrick Broe and Benji Naesen, the show offers unrivalled coverage of the sport, providing cutting-edge insights from two guys who sure know their stuff despite having never ridden in the pro peloton (though since starting the podcast they’ve picked up work behind the scenes at top pro teams).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The duo pick apart team tactics, analysing and predicting every WorldTour race on both the men’s and women’s calendars. They also round up cycling news, transfer stories and interview some of the sport’s biggest names, notably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS7PSE0-3nw\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel </a>who went on the podcast back in the summer of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available on video and on audio platforms, the colloquially known LRCP is a good place to start if you’re looking to delve deeper into the mechanics of pro cycling and hear unfiltered opinions on the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Watch on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/lanternerougecyclingpodcast\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Listen on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6SgAvOJ2kOpswpe0aOMgDH\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

In his self-titled podcast, the British broadcaster and former national champion sits down with some of the sport’s biggest names to discuss their careers and achievements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each hour-long discussion is centred around a particular figure in the sport, whether that be a current Tour de France contender, former pro, TV pundit or famous cycling fan. Jasper Philipsen, Alison Jackson, Victor Campenaerts and Irish comedian David O’Doherty are just a few of the names to have featured on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that tickled your fancy, there’s also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMWi0rb1SwQHnDbv25G0vxLp0EXkr9pGo\" target=\"_blank\">Stephens’ Cafe Ride YouTube series</a> where he takes the riders and celebs out on their local (most of the time) ride and it’s very funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2JMMyFJkuqORQSv9YHObXD\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.

Despite their shady background, these three know a thing or two about pro racing, having spent most of their lives well-embedded in the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the season, the team share their opinions on the sport, interview their old buddies and cast unique insights on the current peloton. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-ullrich-1997\" target=\"_blank\">Jan Ullrich</a> and Bradley Wiggins have featured on the podcast before, the former using it as a platform to make his long-awaited media comeback after a turbulent couple of years in recluse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Move also has a TED Talk-style sibling called The Forward, where Lance interviews celebrities, politicians and businesspeople. Both come under Lance’s mysteriously named WEDŪ media brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Watch on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@wedu/videos\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Listen on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7lBawO6ay88hB7WpO0Z0fn\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.
