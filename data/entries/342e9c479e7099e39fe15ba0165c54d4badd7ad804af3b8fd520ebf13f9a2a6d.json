However, some parents had complained that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/30/apple-promises-further-updates-to-screen-time/\">Screen Time settings sometimes reset or failed to sync across all devices</a> within a Family Sharing group.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We are aware that some users may be experiencing an issue where Screen Time settings are unexpectedly reset,\" an Apple spokesperson said, in a statement shared with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in July. \"We take these reports very seriously and we have been, and will continue, making updates to improve the situation.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already attempted to improve Screen Time settings syncing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-16-5-features/\">with iOS 16.5</a>, but the issue persisted for some users on later software versions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nScreen Time launched in 2018 as part of iOS 12, providing parents with a built-in option for the type of controls that previously required third-party apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.1 should be released next week. A final beta version <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-rc/\">known as the Release Candidate</a> was made available to developers for testing today.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/screen-time/\">Screen Time</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/ios-17-1-improves-screen-time-syncing/\">iOS 17.1 Improves Screen Time Syncing Across Apple Devices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-improves-screen-time-syncing-across-apple-devices.2407868/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"342e9c479e7099e39fe15ba0165c54d4badd7ad804af3b8fd520ebf13f9a2a6d","category":"Apple"}
