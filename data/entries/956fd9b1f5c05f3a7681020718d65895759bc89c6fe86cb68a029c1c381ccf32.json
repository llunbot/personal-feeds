With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S. Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.</blockquote>Apple Pay Later officially launched in October and only in the United States, but it had been available in a testing capacity since March 2023. Available in the Wallet app, ‌Apple Pay‌ later allowed customers to split a purchase made with ‌Apple Pay‌ into four equal payments over a six week period, with no interest or fees. ‌Apple Pay‌ Later was available on purchases made on an iOS device using ‌Apple Pay‌, and was limited to merchandise priced between $75 and $1,000. Each purchase required a separate loan application and approval.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did not provide insight into why it is discontinuing ‌Apple Pay‌ Later, but it is working to unravel its partnership with Goldman Sachs, the company that handles the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a>, the Apple Savings account, and ‌Apple Pay‌ Later. Nixing ‌Apple Pay‌ Later means that Apple does not need to worry about replacing that functionality with a future partner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, Apple will let users access installment financing options from their bank when using ‌Apple Pay‌, which will replace the ‌Apple Pay‌ Later feature that Apple is eliminating. ‌Apple Pay‌ will also gain support for viewing rewards or points balances in Wallet and redeeming them with purchases.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-later/\">Apple Pay Later</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later/\">Apple Discontinuing Apple Pay Later</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later.2429447/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"956fd9b1f5c05f3a7681020718d65895759bc89c6fe86cb68a029c1c381ccf32","category":"Apple"}
