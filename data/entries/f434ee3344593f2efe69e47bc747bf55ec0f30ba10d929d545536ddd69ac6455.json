There's been a lot of recent news in hypersonic testing. We cover some of that in this week's newsletter, but it's just a taste of the US military's appetite for fielding its own hypersonic weapons, and conversely, the Pentagon's emphasis on the detection and destruction of an enemy's hypersonic missiles. China has already declared its first hypersonic weapons operational, and Russia claims to have them, too. Now, the Pentagon is finally close to placing hypersonic missiles with combat units. Many US rocket companies believe the hypersonics sector is a lucrative business. Some companies have enough confidence in this emerging market<span>—or lack of faith in the traditional space launch market</span><span>—to pivot entirely toward hypersonics. I'm interested in seeing if their bets pay off.</span></p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.

Twice in the last five months, the company launched a hypersonic vehicle over the Pacific Ocean, accelerated it to more than five times the speed of sound, and autonomously landed at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/stratolaunch-successfully-flies-a-modern-replacement-for-the-x-15-rocket-plane/\">Ars reports</a>. Stratolaunch used the same Talon-A vehicle for both flights, demonstrating its reusability, a characteristic that sets it apart from competitors. Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch's president and CEO, said his team aims to ramp up to monthly flights by the end of the year.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-rocket-lab-to-demo-cargo-delivery-americas-new-icbm-in-trouble/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-rocket-lab-to-demo-cargo-delivery-americas-new-icbm-in-trouble/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f434ee3344593f2efe69e47bc747bf55ec0f30ba10d929d545536ddd69ac6455","category":"Tech"}
