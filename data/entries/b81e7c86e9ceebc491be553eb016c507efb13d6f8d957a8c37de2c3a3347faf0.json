Case in point is WTB’s new <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/products/bailiff\" target=\"_blank\">Bailiff</a> ($134.95) 27.5 x 4.5″ fatbike tires. These are available in standard and studded, with carbide studs pre-installed. Yet, both versions feature 312 stud pockets for unbeatable traction on ice. The Bailiff’s tubeless-ready 120tpi casing provides a supple ride feel, conforms to all surface conditions, and minimizes rotational weight. Its snow-specific compound remains soft at extremely cold temperatures to provide unparalleled traction on the most frigid days of the year. </p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/products/bailiff\" target=\"_blank\">WTB</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wtbs-bailiff-27-5-x-4-5-fatbike-tires/\">WTB’s Bailiff 27.5 x 4.5″ Fatbike Tires</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b81e7c86e9ceebc491be553eb016c507efb13d6f8d957a8c37de2c3a3347faf0","category":"Cycling"}
