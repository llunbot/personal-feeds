Just a month ago, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/24/carplay-over-800-vehicle-models/\">Lotus appeared in Apple's configuration files</a> as another upcoming brand that will support the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMercedes-Benz <a href=\"https://media.mercedes-benz.com/press-kit/2b41d0bb-f447-4d97-bfde-c10339232424/article/ca92e61f-252f-408d-be80-a7d659909c72\">announced last month</a> that the new E-Class sedan will support the feature, which it refers to as Digital Vehicle Key, as part of its KEYLESS-GO Comfort Package. The E-Class digital key can be shared with up to 16 people, with the primary user able to assign certain rights to specific users such as only allowing access to the vehicle or also allowing it to be driven.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDepending on the technology adopted by a given manufacturer, you may need to hold your device in close proximity to the door handle or in-car reader, while other vehicles may support passive entry where the digital key will function as long as you have your device on you. Select vehicles may also support remote lock and unlock via the digital car key.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mercedes-benz/\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/\">Car Keys</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/23/mercedes-digital-car-key-e-class/\">Mercedes-Benz Preparing to Launch Digital Car Key Support for iPhone and Apple Watch in Latest E-Class Sedan</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mercedes-benz-preparing-to-launch-digital-car-key-support-for-iphone-and-apple-watch-in-latest-e-class-sedan.2390332/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7843aa2a5dfdaebc6c5daccb1764a906023af1380ff99331bf31a04573bf62dc","category":"Apple"}
