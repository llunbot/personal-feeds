Only this time, it’s as a low-cost eBike, and it’s marketed to young riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold on, doesn’t it seem like a bad time to release a bike named the Hurricane? On the surface, yes, but most bikes are in development for years before they are launched, so Schwinn likely named this bike long before the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bike-industry-asheville-north-carolina-hurricane-helene-relief-fundraiser/\">devastation of the recent hurricanes</a>. Schwinn also has a history with the name. Following the success of the Tornado and Typhoon, Schwinn’s original 1978 Hurricane took naming inspiration from natural disasters, but styling inspiration from Motocross. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the new bike shares the same seat type, it’s substantially different than the Hurricane of yesteryear. Now, that was a bitchen bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S22_Schwinn_History_Page_1978_800x800-D.jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S22_Schwinn_History_Page_1978_800x800-D.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Original Schwinn Hurricane\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S22_Schwinn_History_Page_1978_800x800-D.jpg.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S22_Schwinn_History_Page_1978_800x800-D.jpg-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S22_Schwinn_History_Page_1978_800x800-D.jpg-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S22_Schwinn_History_Page_1978_800x800-D.jpg-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The OG Schwinn Hurricane (Photo / Schwinn)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Long gone are the fillet-brazed glory days of Schwinn Bicycles.

But, it also allows you to find the right fit on the bike. Schwinn says it’s for riders age 13+ and up to 260lbs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, I’m not trying to be a curmudgeon, but I think this age bracket should be using an actual bicycle to get around. When I was 13 I had the lungs and the legs to take my Schwinn Stingray anywhere I wanted. That was also in 1978. Kids these days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s OK, I’m just saying what you’re thinking. Now get off my lawn. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Schwinn-Hurricane-pop-a-wheelie-seat-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Schwinn-Hurricane-pop-a-wheelie-seat-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"New Schwinn Hurricane pop-a-wheelie seat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Schwinn-Hurricane-pop-a-wheelie-seat-jpeg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Schwinn-Hurricane-pop-a-wheelie-seat-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Schwinn-Hurricane-pop-a-wheelie-seat-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Schwinn-Hurricane-pop-a-wheelie-seat-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hurricane Retails and Specs (from the website)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $600</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Durable steel frame</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Aluminum rims</li>\n\n\n\n<li>JAK mechanical disc brakes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Moto-style” seat with foam padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 56lbs (seems very heavy for such a small bike)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Steel dual crown, rigid fork</li>\n\n\n\n<li>14″x 3″ tires</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Steel, 680mm wide handlebars with a 22.2mm clamp</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Soft comfort”, single density grips</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kickstand and front and rear fenders</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t get mad at me, check out the bikes at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.schwinnbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SchwinnBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwinn-hurricane-compact-ebike-for-teens/\">Schwinn Hurricane Storms Back In as a Compact eBike for Teens</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"55f9461f5c744b20f0494978cc788936da8067f45a6e6cf53f2354e2edd23108","category":"Cycling"}
