Apple says the battery pack is able to wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> at up to 5W on the go, or at up to 15W when the battery pack is connected to a 20W or higher power adapter with a Lightning to USB-C cable.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/magsafe-battery-pack-available-for-in-store-pickup/\">MagSafe Battery Pack Now Available for In-Store Pickup in UK, EU, Australia, Japan, and China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magsafe-battery-pack-now-available-for-in-store-pickup-in-uk-eu-australia-japan-and-china.2304843/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JyXc8dSK8Fk:5Ex3qt1ooqI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JyXc8dSK8Fk:5Ex3qt1ooqI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JyXc8dSK8Fk\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6844879e13be3993786beef8e151d17e618c713c5e0c363160a95598ad97bfaf","category":"Apple"}
