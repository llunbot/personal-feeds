What I’m saying is that <a href=\"https://www.lizardskins.com/\">Lizard Skins</a> knows a thing or two about grips. Keeping up with the times, they’re introducing their latest, and super <a href=\"https://www.lizardskins.com/product-details?h=3dgrp-single-compound-jet-black&amp;c=slip-on_handlebar_grips&amp;t=3dgrp&amp;v=0\">high-tech bicycle grip</a>, the 3DGRP. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-on-bar.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-on-bar-800x586.jpeg\" alt=\"Lizard Skins 3DGRP on bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-on-bar-800x586.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-on-bar-297x218.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-on-bar-120x88.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-on-bar-768x563.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-on-bar.jpeg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Lizard Skins)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 3DGRP grips are created by <a href=\"https://www.carbon3d.com/\">Carbon</a> utilizing their Digital Light Synthesis technology. “<em>DLS is a production method using programmable liquid resins, digital ultraviolet light projection, and oxygen permeable optics to create pieces with superb performance and surface finish</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When using these types of advancements in 3D printing, the development of the Lizard Skins 3DGRP was unrestrained by traditional manufacturing methods and materials. And they think that the 3DGRP grip will help you take your ride to the next level. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Look How the Lizard Skins 3DGRP Is Made</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been pretty quiet over at Lizard Skins since it was announced that <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2023/11/03/fox-factory-buy-baseball-softball-brand-marucci-572-million\" target=\"_blank\">Fox Factory was set to purchase their parent company Marucci</a>, though they seem to still be innovating. For those unaware, Carbon is the 3D printing company that has been partnering with a number of cycling brands to create new products including Specialized and Kú Cycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense then that the 3DGRP lattice looks similar to that of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-s-works-romin-evo-gets-the-mirror-treatment-for-longer-3d-printed-saddle-design/\">Specialized 3D printed saddles</a>. It will be interesting to see how the material and pattern holds up when used as a grip. Between all the holes and the fact that they’re not lockons, these had better be really comfortable to justify the price. But if they are anything like those 3D printed saddles, they’ll probably end up some of the most comfortable grips ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 3DGRP Retail and Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-studio.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-studio-800x806.jpeg\" alt=\"Lizard Skins 3DGRP studio\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-studio-800x806.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-studio-297x300.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-studio-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-studio-768x773.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lizard-Skins-3DGRP-studio.jpeg 983w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $51.99</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Total Weight: 68 grams / 2.39 ounces</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Length: 133 millimeters / 5.11 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diameter: Medium (32 millimeters / 1.26 inches)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compatible with MTB, BMX, ATV, and PWC</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.lizardskins.com/\">LizardSkins.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lizard-skins-3d-printed-bike-grip-3dgrp/\">Lizard Skins 3d Prints New 3DGRP with Digital Light Synthesis</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"50fb9890c8a32c885bda3ac4c20d5ac9fa30d9d70378443d0f4bc9a99326b08d","category":"Cycling"}
