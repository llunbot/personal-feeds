I sold many treasures out of my fleet, including a 1986 Eddy Merckx Super Corsa that I bought from the original owner in Boulder, CO, and brought with me to Canada. But the opportunity to build a custom bike with a local builder was worth it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0776.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I wanted a bike that suited my needs for long-distance gravel rides, fun in-town singletrack rips that I can ride to, silly rides where I ride 50km out of town to rip XC trails and then ride back home. Also, I was over skinny road tires and was curious about big volume slicks for the little bit of road riding I do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0024.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Corey, the fabricator, artist, and creator of Kruch, allowed me to have a blank canvas to dream upon. I wanted a long front end, adjustable dropouts, and more of a mountain bike geo rather than gravel. I based much of this geo and concept after riding the Hurt’n Albert’n 550 back in 2016 where I converted an old Gary Fisher Rig to a drop bar 29er. Comfy! Slacking HT at 68. Steepish SA at 75. 440mm chainstays and 1123mm wheelbase. FYI I am 5’8”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1452.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The character of this bike I love the most, besides the versatility and the quality, is how well it fits and rides me. All those years of thinking of how I would build a bike have come to a point and I am not disappointed. That being said, I don’t think years of experience in the bike industry is needed to build a well-fitting and great riding bike. Find a local builder. Communicate with them. Enjoy the experience of building a custom bike! Your builder will help you find your dream bike.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/2A9D7D2B-4E7C-45BB-BE4F-07345422221B.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Build Spec:</strong><br />\nCustom Kruch Frame and fork with glow-in-the-dark powdercoat with custom locally printed decals by 54Blue<br />\nKing hubs laced to Stan’s Arch rims<br />\nTires are either Compass Antelope Hill 29×2.2, Maxxis Aspens 2.25, or Bontrager XR 4 2.6/2.4<br />\nTRP levers with Paul Klampers<br />\nWhite Industries M30 cranks with White Industries BB<br />\nSpank Flare 25 Vibrocore bar with Paul Boxcar 35mm<br />\nWhite Industries headset<br />\nPNW Loam dropper with Paul lever<br />\nFabric Scoop saddle<br />\nSRAM 11 speed drivetrain with Paul shifter clamp<br />\nPorcelain Rocket partial frame bag</p>\n<p>The next step with the “All-Country” is some custom front and rear racks and some overnight adventures.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
