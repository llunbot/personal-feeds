(Evo laptops are Intel-certified premium ultralights meeting <a href=\"https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/performance/benchmarks/intel-evo/\">certain criteria</a>, like providing at least eight hours of battery life with a QHD display.) Imagine my shock when I realized I had been using that very mouse with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/dell-xps-13-2022-review/\">Dell XPS 13</a> (an Evo laptop) for almost eight months <em>without Intel's blessing.</em></p>\n<p>Of course, even before the mouse gained Intel's stamp of approval, I had enjoyed hours of problem-free use. The same can be said of every functioning USB webcam I'm ever plugged into a computer. But that hasn't stopped countless peripheral makers from touting that their devices have been certified for Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1916774#p3\">Read 59 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1916774&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b741141d8aa8ec7c3964ffa44fc404b9f4e5569196c8efac9af9890e1da8ebb","category":"Tech"}
