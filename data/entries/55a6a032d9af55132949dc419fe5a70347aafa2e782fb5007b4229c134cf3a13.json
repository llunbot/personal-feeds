He can now call himself a mountain stage winner at the Tour. That's a special achievement for any rider let alone one that already has a sprint victory at the Tour. </p>\n<p>His performance was as dramatic as the lunarscape backdrop, dispatching proper climbers like Bauke Mollema, Julian Alaphilippe and Pierre Rolland with sheer, unadulterated power. On Ventoux, Van Aert displayed versatility in ways we haven't seen since the 1980s when the likes of Sean Kelly were riding. It was old school racing. </p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9838/gallery-bikes-of-the-tour-de-france-2021\">Gallery: Bikes of the Tour de France 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nBehind Van Aert, the battle for yellow showed signs of life. <a href=\"/tags/tadej-pogacar\">Tadej Pogacar</a> showed the first sign of weakness as he was dropped by Jonas Vingegaard on the upper slopes of Ventoux. Luckily for Pogacar, a fast descent allowed him to chase back but the embers of a GC battle did begin to flicker.</p>\n<p>And even further back, a battle to make the time cut. Cavendish made it, Soren Kragh Andersen did too, albeit by just one second. But unfortunately for the Ineos Grenadiers, Luke Rowe's Tour was cut short as the double ascent of Ventoux proved a climb too far.</p>\n<p>Below, the best images from Chris Auld:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9854/tour-de-france-2021-stage-11-gallery#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 28</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/cauldphoto-tdf-stage11-2.jpg?itok=9_XdJodP\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>28</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9854/tour-de-france-2021-stage-11-gallery\">Tour de France 2021 Stage 11 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>8 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9854%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2011%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9854%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2011%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9854%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2011%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9854%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-11-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9854/tour-de-france-2021-stage-11-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 28</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/cauldphoto-tdf-stage11-4.jpg?itok=8FYhfw6M\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"55a6a032d9af55132949dc419fe5a70347aafa2e782fb5007b4229c134cf3a13","category":"Cycling"}
