The mostly pan-flat terrain of the northern Netherlands was punctuated by a few cobbled sectors and four ascents of the VAM-berg, the last coming 15 km before the flat finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The early break of Lieke Nooijen (Parkhotel Valkenberg) and Janneke Ensing (BikeExchange) – the latter racing on home roads for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JannekeEnsing/status/1451167931149295622?s=20\">last time before retirement</a> – led the field over the cobbled sectors in the first half of the race before being brought back at around the halfway mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers Kirstie van Haaften (Parkhotel Valkenberg) and Margaux Vigie (Valcar-Travel &amp; Service) carried a small lead onto the first ascent of the VAM-berg, but the pair were neutralised by the top of the climb as the race began to heat up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attacks persisted in the last 60 km as the non-sprinters and smaller teams attempted to avoid the traditional bunch sprint. The British pairing of newly crowned national champion Pfeiffer Georgi (Team DSM) and Alice Barnes (Canyon-SRAM) established a 25-second gap on the way to the second VAM-berg circuit. Their advantage yo-yoed ahead of the strung out peloton until they reached the foot of the infamous man-made climb for the final ascent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trio of attackers – Elena Cecchini (SD Worx), Elise Chabbey (Canyon-SRAM) and Floortje Mackaij (Team DSM) – earned a gap over the last climb and they were joined for the last 10 km by a dangerous four-rider chase group that was stacked with Team DSM riders, including Wiebes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DSM riders drove the pace into the closing kilometres, keeping what was left of the peloton at bay and perfectly setting up their sprinter. Wiebes won with a few bike lengths to spare, with Cecchini in second and Eleanora Gasparrini (Valcar-Travel &amp; Service) crossing the line in third.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n\t\t            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUCI Women's WorldTour Ronde van Drenthe (1.WWT)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <span>Assen → Hoogeveen</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255523\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                        <img />\n\t\t\t\t\t                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">WIEBES Lorena</a>\n                                            <span>Team DSM</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>04:07:34</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">CECCHINI Elena</a>\n                                            <span>SD Worx</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>3</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">GASPARRINI Eleonora Camilla</a>\n                                            <span>Valcar - Travel &amp;
