AUO has just begun mass production of microLED watch display panels, while PayNitride is mass producing related chips. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTalks between Apple and PlayNitride have reportedly faltered due to scale limitations, but AUO has apparently emerged as a \"promising partner\" with its advancements in microLED display applications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report aligns with comments made by <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240301-12054.html\">TrendForce</a>, which previously said that Taiwan and South Korea have a \"robust lineup of manufacturers for Micro LED chips, backplanes, and related transfer processes.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo last week claimed that microLED production costs are currently \"too high\" for its Apple Watch Ultra project to be \"economically viable.\" But according to industry sources cited by <em>DigiTimes</em>, the high costs of early microLED production remain within expectations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Based on Apple's track record in development, high expenses tied to pioneering technologies are typically manageable and can be addressed as long as production scales up,\" said the report. \"However, the primary challenge persists in overcoming associated technological bottlenecks.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese bottlenecks are said to include an absence of circuit control design within the LEDs, which potentially increases the risk of LED chip damage. \"Furthermore, the stamp technology solution falls short in achieving precise transfer, particularly when interfacing with Osram's vertical chips,\" according to <em>DigiTimes</em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe main takeaway from today's report is that Apple likely still hopes to eventually transition to microLED in the future, but the Apple Watch Ultra may not be the first product to adopt the technology. According to a separate report by <em><a href=\"https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=26333\">The Elec</a></em>, Apple may instead decide to prioritize microLED technology for future, lighter versions of Apple Vision Pro while it waits for watch implementation costs to come down.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-still-dedicated-microled-apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Still Plans MicroLED Apple Watch Ultra, Seeks New Suppliers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-plans-microled-apple-watch-ultra-seeks-new-suppliers.2420987/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d8ec797907f66aa2423f9935608e87e7fe5048b822dd7f239e5febe6212f1083","category":"Apple"}
