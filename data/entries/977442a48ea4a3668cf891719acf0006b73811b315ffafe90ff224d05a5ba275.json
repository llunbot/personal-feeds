The post includes an #AppleLaunch hashtag, along with a short video featuring an animated Apple logo inside of a circle. No other details were provided.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo, what can we expect? We outline some possibilities below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to MacRumors on YouTube</a></em></div>\r<br />\n<h2>New iPhone SE or iPhone 16E</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe most likely possibility seems to be a new entry-level iPhone SE. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman already said a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/\">new iPhone SE was coming by next week</a>, prior to Apple's teaser, and he has since doubled down on his claim.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Tim Cook teases the new iPhone SE,\" he <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1890069182286602362\">said</a>, in a social media post today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPhone SE is rumored to feature a larger screen than the current model, a USB-C port, Apple Intelligence support, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother rumored name for the next iPhone SE <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e/\">is iPhone 16E</a>, which would be the so-called \"newest member\" of the iPhone 16 family.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New MacBook Air and iPads</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/macbook-air-blue-image.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nNew models of the MacBook Air, iPad Air, and entry-level iPad are \"coming soon,\" according to Gurman. He said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/ipad-air-macbook-air-stocks-running-low-apple/\">MacBook Air and iPad Air inventory is running low</a> at many of Apple's stores. It is unclear if any of these devices will be announced next week, though, with Gurman seemingly suggesting they are coming a little bit later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNewer chips are expected for these devices, including the M4 chip for the MacBook Air, the M3 chip for the iPad Air, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/ipad-11-with-a16-chip-identifier-leak/\">either the A16 Bionic chip or A17 Pro chip</a> for the entry-level iPad 11. No other significant changes have been rumored.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Smart Home Hub</h2>\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-1-Textless.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1688\" /><em>A made-up concept of an Apple smart home hub</em></div>\r<br />\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">rumored smart home hub</a> is not expected to enter mass production <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/\">until the second half of 2025</a>, but what if Apple surprises us with an early preview next week? Many all-new Apple product categories were previewed months prior to an actual launch, including the original iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, HomePod, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe home hub is expected to resemble a HomePod with a screen, with rumored features including a 6-inch or 7-inch display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support. Gurman said it can be attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, or mounted on a wall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman previously said the home hub will be \"Apple's most significant release of the year,\" as it represents the company's \"first step toward a bigger role in the smart home.\" He said the device will be like a \"smaller and cheaper iPad\" that lets users \"control appliances, conduct FaceTime chats, and handle other tasks.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirTag 2</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/airtag-purple-prime-day.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe circle around the animated Apple logo in Cook's post has fueled online speculation about an AirTag 2 announcement next week. This is entirely based on the fact that the current AirTag, announced in April 2021, has a circular design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman is skeptical about an AirTag 2 next week, though.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Lots of folks pointing out the circular design and think it's an AirTag,\" he <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1890070656353714258\">said</a>. \"There is a new one coming this year. But Tim isn't going to put out a teaser for a new $29 accessory. He would for a major new low end iPhone though.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman previously said the AirTag 2 will be released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/airtag-2-release-date/\">around the midpoint of 2025</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumored features for the next AirTag include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/airtag-2-important-upgrade/\">more tamper-proof speaker to reduce stalking</a>, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip with up to 3Ã— longer range for item tracking, and improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro headset.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/what-to-expect-from-the-apple-launch-next-week/\">What to Expect From the 'Apple Launch' Next Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-the-apple-launch-next-week.2449332/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"977442a48ea4a3668cf891719acf0006b73811b315ffafe90ff224d05a5ba275","category":"Apple"}
