We should create and manage reusable components in the frontend and the UX of our website, as well as coordinate with the backend and the content itself.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll discuss how to go through both the server and the client sides of our projects and how to align with the content that we’ll manage. We’ll also compare how to <strong>implement composable logic into our code</strong> using different approaches provided by React-based frameworks like Remix and Next.js.</p>\nComposable Architecture\n<p>In the dynamic landscape of web development, the concept of composability has emerged as a key player in crafting scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems. It goes beyond merely constructing design systems; it encompasses the creation and management of reusable components across the entire spectrum of web development, from frontend UX to backend coordination and content management.</p>\n<p>Composability is the art of <strong>building systems in a modular and flexible way</strong>. It emphasizes creating components that are not only reusable but can seamlessly fit together, forming a cohesive and adaptable architecture. This approach not only enhances the development process but also promotes consistency and scalability across projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/full-stack-composability-storyblok/storyblok-composable-architecture.png\" /></p>\n<p>We define “composable architecture” as the idea of building software systems from small, independent components that you can combine to form a complete system. Think of a system as a set of <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/\">LEGO</a> pieces. Putting them together, you can build cool structures, figures, and other creations. But the cool thing about those blocks is that you can exchange them, <strong>reuse them for other creations</strong>, and add new pieces to your existing models.</p>\nParts Of A Composable Architecture\n<p>To manage a composable architecture for our projects, we have to connect two parts:</p>\n<h3>Modular Components</h3>\n<p>Break down the system into independent, self-contained modules or components. Modular components can be developed, tested, and updated independently, promoting reusability and easier maintenance.</p>\n<p>When we talk about modular components, we are referring to units like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Microservices</strong><br />The architectural style for developing software applications as a set of small, independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. The application is broken down into a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability.</li>\n<li><strong>Headless Applications</strong><br />In a headless architecture, the application’s logic and functionality are decoupled from the presentation layer, allowing it to function independently of a specific user interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Packaged Business Capabilities (PBC)</strong><br />A set of activities, products, and services bundled together and offered as a complete solution. It is a very common concept in the e-commerce environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>APIs</h3>\n<p>As the components of our architecture can manage different types of data, processes, and tasks of different natures, they need a common language to communicate between them. Components should expose consistent and well-documented APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other.</p>\nBenefits Of A Composable Architecture\n<p>When applying a composable approach to the architecture of our projects, we will see some benefits and advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy to reuse.</strong><br />Components are designed to be modular and independent. This makes it easy to reuse them in different parts of the system or entirely different systems. Reusability can significantly reduce development time and effort, as well as improve consistency across different projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy to scale.</strong><br />When the demand for a particular service or functionality increases, you can scale the system by adding more instances of the relevant components without affecting the entire architecture. This scalability is essential for handling growing workloads and adapting to changing business requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy to maintain.</strong><br />Each component is self-contained. If there’s a need to update or fix a specific feature, it can be done without affecting the entire system. This modularity makes it easier to identify, isolate, and address issues, reducing the impact of maintenance activities on the overall system.</li>\n<li><strong>Independence from vendors.</strong><br />This reduces the dependence on specific vendors for components, making it easier to switch or upgrade individual parts without disrupting the entire system. </li>\n<li><strong>Faster development and iteration.</strong><br />Development teams can work on different components concurrently. This parallel development accelerates the overall development process. Additionally, updates and improvements can be rolled out independently.</li>\n</ul>\nThe MACH Architecture\n<p>An example of composability is what is called the <a href=\"https://machalliance.org/\">MACH architecture</a>. The MACH acronym breaks down into Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless. This approach is focused on applying composability in a way that allows you to mold the entire ecosystem of your projects and organization to make it align with business needs.</p>\n<p>One of the main ideas of the MACH approach is to let marketers, designers, and front-end developers do their thing without having to worry about the backend in the process. They can tweak the look and feel on the fly, run tests, and <strong>adapt to what customers want</strong> without slowing down the whole operation.</p>\n<p>With MACH architecture, getting to an MVP (minimum viable product) is like a rocket ride. Developers can whip up quick prototypes, and businesses can test out their big ideas before going all-in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/full-stack-composability-storyblok/storyblok-mach-architecture.png\" /></p>\n<p>The advantage of Storyblok, speaking about composability, is the <a href=\"https://www.storyblok.com/docs/guide/essentials/content-structures#component?utm_source=smashing&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=DGM_DEV_SMA_PLG&amp;utm_content=full-stack-composability-with-storyblok/\">component approach</a> it uses to manage the content structures. Because of its Headless nature, Storyblok allows you to use the created components (or “blocks”, as they are called on the platform) with any technology or framework. Linking to the previous topic, you can create component structures to manage content in Storyblok while <strong>managing their visual representation</strong> with React components on the client-side (or server-side) of your application.</p>\nConclusion\n<p>Composability is a powerful paradigm that transforms the way we approach web development. By fostering modularity, reusability, and adaptability, a composable architecture lays the groundwork for building robust and scalable web applications. As we navigate through both server and client sides, aligning with content management, developers can <strong>harness the full potential of composability</strong> in order to create a cohesive and efficient web development ecosystem.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Articles on Smashing Magazine — For Web Designers And Developers","siteHash":"ab069ca35bf300e9db0da36f49701f66485a5b0d2db0471dfeee07cef6204939","entryHash":"199a4eeb6502c1f8f73f5ebc19a7e5b0655d0f5517894cfb99db025a8fc1d91b","category":"Tech"}
