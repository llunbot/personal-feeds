The page will automatically update with the item's latest known location. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said it worked directly with airlines to put systems in place to \"privately and securely\" accept the \"Share Item Location\" links. Access to each link is \"limited to a small number of people,\" and airport employees are required to \"authenticate\" to view the link by signing into their Apple Account or partner email address.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-Share-Item-Location-iPhone-iPad-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe item's location stops being shared \"as soon as a user is reunited with their item,\" or automatically expires after seven days.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.2 was released in December, and Apple said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/\">additional airlines</a> will implement this feature over the coming months.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/airtag-lost-baggage-feature-more-airlines/\">New iPhone Feature for Tracking Lost Baggage Expands to More Airlines</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-feature-for-tracking-lost-baggage-expands-to-more-airlines.2448878/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57b405f458b6500d95c522228fd0beb326a72ebd8e250dac689e0c8eeac9f09c","category":"Apple"}
