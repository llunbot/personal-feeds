This expectation was then seemingly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/report-apple-executives-cautious-of-headset/\">downgraded to three million units</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn August last year, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/08/apple-ar-headset-1-5-million-units/\">planning to ship</a> no more than 1.5 million units in 2023. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> recently said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/report-apple-executives-cautious-of-headset/\">Apple now expects</a> to sell around 900,000 headsets this year. In December last year, Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/04/kuo-apple-headset-2h23-mass-shipments/\">revised his estimate</a> down to \"less than 500,000 units.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has also postulated that Apple may <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-ar-vr-headset-2022-launch/\">sell only one headset per day</a> per retail store, which would equate to annual sales of just over 180,000 units. TrendForce's estimate of less than 100,000 units is the lowest shipment estimate for Apple's headset to date.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/apple-may-ship-less-than-100000-headsets-this-year/\">Apple Mixed-Reality Headset Shipments Now Estimated to 'Fall Short of 100,000 Units' This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-mixed-reality-headset-shipments-now-estimated-to-fall-short-of-100-000-units-this-year.2390388/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6dd8890232a1c569436aaffbf5d9dbd7ca9a713c18caa504d4f275ef4c69172c","category":"Apple"}
