When someone is nearby, a conversation awareness option will lower the sound of the music and focus on voices, while also cutting out background noise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Adaptive Audio and conversation functions also work on calls to make it easier for you to hear the person you're speaking with while you're out and about.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also improving automatic switching across the Apple ecosystem, so you can swap between devices more quickly than before.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new firmware is limited to developers at the current time.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-firmware-beta-airpods/\">Apple Releases Beta Firmware Update for AirPods</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-beta-firmware-update-for-airpods.2391667/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1dad920536895526a16d91e72e19a2212262b85bf9cd2fefe9b010b63f90c8b8","category":"Apple"}
