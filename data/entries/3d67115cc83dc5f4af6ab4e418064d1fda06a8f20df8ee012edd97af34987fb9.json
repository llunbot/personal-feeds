Already, Mozilla <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2023-44/\">has said</a> that its Firefox browser is vulnerable to the same bug, which is tracked as CVE-2023-5217. And just like CVE-2023-4863 from 17 days ago, the new one resides in a widely used code library for processing media files, specifically those in the VP8 format.</p>\n<p>Pages <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/TdkC4pDv\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-5217\">here</a> list hundreds of packages for Ubuntu and Debian alone that rely on the library known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libvpx\">libvpx</a>. Most browsers use it, and the <a href=\"https://www.webmproject.org/about/supporters/\">list</a> of software or vendors supporting it reads like a who’s who of the Internet, including Skype, Adobe, VLC, and Android.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972043#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972043&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3d67115cc83dc5f4af6ab4e418064d1fda06a8f20df8ee012edd97af34987fb9","category":"Tech"}
