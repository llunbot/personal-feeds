But the rodents turn out to be a bit more bloodthirsty than we thought. According to a new paper published in the Journal of Ethology, California ground squirrels have been caught in the act—many times over—of chasing, killing, and eating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole\">voles</a>.</p>\n<p>Co-author Jennifer Smith, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, <a href=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/carnivorous-feeding-squirrels-documented-california\">described</a> the behavior as \"shocking,\" given the sheer number of times they watched squirrels do this. “We had never seen this behavior before,\" <a href=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/carnivorous-feeding-squirrels-documented-california\">she said</a>. \"Squirrels are one of the most familiar animals to people. We see them right outside our windows; we interact with them regularly. Yet here’s this never-before-encountered-in-science behavior that sheds light on the fact that there’s so much more to learn about the natural history of the world around us.”</p>\n<p>Squirrels mainly consume acorns, seeds, nuts, and fruits, but they have been known to supplement that diet with insects and, occasionally, stealing eggs or young hatchlings from nests. And back <a href=\"https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/gbn/vol53/iss2/5/\">in 1993</a>, biologist J.R Callahan caused a stir by reporting that as many as 30 species of squirrel could be preying on smaller creatures: namely, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and the occasional small mammal.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/watch-carnivorous-squirrels-chow-down-on-tasty-voles/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/watch-carnivorous-squirrels-chow-down-on-tasty-voles/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ea646e2d0b2f42310cca56022550e074bed79e94331a83947b1a8c2090173fdf","category":"Tech"}
