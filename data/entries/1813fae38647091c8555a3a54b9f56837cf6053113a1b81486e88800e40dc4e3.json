The One-Twenty is designed to be a bike that can double up on all-day epics while not embarrassing itself on gnarlier trails.</p>\n<p>Merida seems to have given itself quite the task, with the goals of producing a bike that’s a “strong climber, perfect ground coverer, daredevil descender, fun packed, affordable and with a simple to look after and reliable top performing design”.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida OneTwenty\" title=\"merida onetwenty three quarters\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The One-Twenty is designed to tackle all-day epics and singletrack blasts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>This is achieved via modern geometry, with angles that are straight out of the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bike</a> recipe book, as well as suspension derived from Merida’s Bike of the Year winning <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-mtb-bike-of-the-year-winners/\">longer-travel rigs</a>.</p>\n<p>The One-Twenty is alloy only, and sees three models coming to market.</p>\n<p>The same alloy frame forms the basis of a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">budget XC racer</a>, when paired with a shorter-stroke shock and fork. This is aimed at the European market, where more conservative travel numbers may appeal.

The frames are rated (and warrantied) to ‘Level 4’ use, which includes <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">enduro racing</a>, should you wish to set times down tracks on your shorter-travel rig.</p>\n<p>The suspension details given to us by Merida are fairly typical of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The system is designed to be progressive, with plenty of bottom-out resistance so you can push the shorter-travel bike hard. This, in turn, gives a poppy mid-stroke, so you’re encouraged to get the bike airborne at any opportunity.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Chainstay protection\" title=\"merida onetwenty chainstay protection\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s plenty of protection for the frame’s paint.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Deep in the travel, the anti-squat is low, so there shouldn’t be any harsh pedal kickback, though at around the sag point it should be just over 100 per cent. Therefore, your pedal stroke shouldn’t make the rear shock bob through its travel in an energy-inefficient manner.</p>\n<p>In terms of anti-rise (the impact of braking on suspension), Merida says it’s below 100 per cent for the full travel of the bike. This means the suspension should remain active whenever the brakes are applied (rather than stiffening up and decreasing the bike’s ability to deal with impacts when the brakes are on).</p>\n<h3>Angle of attack</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Pike\" title=\"merida onetwenty rockshox pike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A sturdy RockShox Pike fork is placed up-front on the top-spec model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>When it comes to the shape of the bike, it’s no surprise to see some rather interesting angles from Merida, certainly if you kept abreast of the One-Forty and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/merida-one-sixty-6000-review/\">One-Sixty</a> bikes launched a year ago.</p>\n<p>The seat angle, in particular, is steep at 78.5 degrees (and it’s steeper on the Ninety-Six Lite, covered below), while the head angle is a little more middle-of-the-road, at 66 degrees.

Looking to race XC on a budget? This model from Merida could be a good starting point.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<h3>Merida Ninety-Six Lite XT Edition details</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, Shimano’s XT groupset features here, alongside Deore brakes.</p>\n<p>Up-front, there’s a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-rockshox-sid/\">RockShox SID SL fork</a> with 110mm of travel, while a Deluxe Select+ shock controls the rear.</p>\n<p>Maxxis’ 3C EXO Rekon Race tyres are intended to keep things rolling quickly.</p>\n<h3>Merida Ninety-Six Lite 400 details</h3>\n<p>Suntour’s Raidon34 R-2CR fork heads up this build, with a matching shock at the rear.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s Deore 12-speed groupset provides the drive, while MT200 brakes bring it all to a halt.</p>\n<p>Once again, there’s a Rekon Race tread, but the tyre has a cheaper wire bead.</p>\n<h2>Merida One-Twenty 700 initial ride impressions</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida OneTwenty climbing\" title=\"merida onetwenty climbing\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With stable suspension, the One-Twenty climbs well.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>I rode the top-line One-Twenty for a day on Exmoor during the bike’s co-launch with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/merida-onesixty-fr/\">One-Sixty FR</a>.</p>\n<p>The conditions were mercifully dry (a rare sight this summer in the UK) and the trails dusty and buff – perfect territory to get to grips with the bike.</p>\n<p>As I found with the One-Forty, climbing manners on Merida’s bikes are second to none. The suspension system seems largely immune to pedal-induced bob, until you really start mashing the pedals.</p>\n<p>If you want to completely remove any shock movement, there’s a dial on the shock.</p>\n<p>The seated position is good, with the steep seat tube angle placing your hips centrally over the bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>The front end is a touch shorter than on the longer-travel bikes. As such, there’s a hint less of the rangey feel the bigger bikes have, but the One-Twenty doesn’t feel cramped.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida OneTwenty cornering\" title=\"merida onetwenty cornering\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With the Forekasters biting, the One-Twenty feels fun through the corners</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Adding to the zippy feel are the Forekaster tyres from Maxxis. Their mid-depth, mid-aggression tread rolls faster than a ‘true’ trail tyre, while still giving just enough bite to scrabble up marginal climbs.</p>\n<p>The rims are wide, and so with 2.4in rubber I was happy running moderately <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/trail-tech-mountain-bike-tyre-pressure-all-you-need-to-know/\">low pressures</a> to further enhance grip.</p>\n<p>On the way back down, the One-Twenty shows its true colours.</p>\n<p>The tyres pick up speed quickly, and a few jabs at the pedals will yet further increase speed.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida OneTwenty descending\" title=\"merida onetwenty descending\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The short-travel trail bike doesn’t shy away downhill.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>I appreciated the Pike’s sturdy chassis when I encountered chunkier trails, as well as the progression from the rear suspension. It’s supportive and then protective as you reach the later stages of its travel.</p>\n<p>While not overly slack, the geometry doesn’t seem to hold the bike back – certainly if you remember this is one of the brand’s shorter-travel options.</p>\n<p>There’s enough front-end length to give confidence on faster trails, while once you’ve learnt the limits of the Forekaster, cornering is a hoot, with the bike displaying plenty of agility.</p>\n<p>I have the Merida One-Twenty 700 in for a full review, so look out for that soon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"1813fae38647091c8555a3a54b9f56837cf6053113a1b81486e88800e40dc4e3","category":"Cycling"}
