{"title":"Apple Pencil 3 with a new squeeze gesture could be coming soon","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2286875/apple-pencil-3-squeeze-gesture-ipados-17-5-beta.html","date":1712160883000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumor has it that Apple is going to release a new Apple Pencil 3–which would <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2156898/apple-pencil-compared-1st-2nd-gen-vs-usb-c.html\">actually make it the fourth Pencil</a> but who’s counting? But this new Pencil 3 will stand out from the quartet because it could support a new “squeeze” gesture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/02/squeeze-gesture-apple-pencil-3/&amp;xcust=1-1-2286875-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">report</a> by 9to5Mac, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262753/ios-17-5-beta-is-now-available-with-app-downloads-from-websites-in-eu.html\">iPadOS 17.5 beta</a> that was released on Tuesday includes code for an Apple Pencil squeeze gesture. Squeeze would be used for “quick interactions such as adding shapes, signatures, stickers, or a text field.” The code doesn’t explain how the gesture works, but presumably, it would work by squeezing the Pencil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three Pencils that Apple currently offer don’t have pressure sensors in the body where the user holds it, so this new gesture suggests that Apple is going to release a new Pencil 3. If a new Pencil 3 does arrive, it could replace a current one in the lineup, probably the 2nd-generation Pencil, which is the most expensive model at $129/£139/€149 and works with the iPad Pro, iPad mini, and iPad Air. The 1st-generation Pencil ($99/£109/€119) would likely stay since it works with the 9th- and 10th-generation iPad. The USB-C Pencil could also stick around as Apple’s most affordable Pencil at $79/£79/€95.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Or Apple could keep all the Pencils in its lineup and offer four of them, which would accomplish the goal of making the Pencil lineup more confusing than it already is.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also introduced a new version of the PencilKit API with iPadOS 17.4, but we haven’t seen any reports about any new features the API provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About a year ago, Apple filed a patent application for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1931787/a-future-apple-pencil-could-have-find-my-support.html\">acoustic resonators in Apple Pencil</a>. This seemed to indicate that Apple is working on Find My support for the device–the resonators would be used to alert a user to its location. None of the current Pencils are outfitted with resonators, so a new Pencil 3 could have this feature. A recent rumor also suggested the new Pencil could work as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2278925/apple-pencil-vision-pro-rumor-drawing-color-selection.html\">an input device</a> for Apple Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to announce new iPads soon. The latest report said that the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2282952/ipad-pro-ipad-air-launch-shipping-may-2024.html\">iPad Pro and iPad Air won’t arrive until May</a>. Macworld theorizes, based on Apple’s release history, that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2277216/new-ipad-air-pro-launch-april-may-2024.html\">Apple will make an iPad announcement sometime this month</a>–perhaps Apple 23 or around that time. For more about the possible new iPad, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> rumor roundups.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c1c8cc7c003049d7c0a6a307992c3746418aa5a08a9f4579d867678e9edd46b4","category":"Apple"}
