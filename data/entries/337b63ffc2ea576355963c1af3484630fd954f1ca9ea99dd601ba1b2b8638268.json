We're finally getting a new film from this gifted director: the sci-fi comedy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_17\"><em>Mickey 17</em></a>, based on the 2022 novel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey7\"><em>Mickey7</em></a> by Edward Ashton. Judging by the trailer that recently dropped, it feels a bit like a darkly comic version of Duncan Jones' 2009 film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(2009_film)\"><em>Moon</em></a>, with a bit of the surreal absurdity of Terry Gilliam's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)\"><em>Brazil</em></a> (1985) thrown in for good measure. And the visuals are terrific.</p>\n<p>Ashton's inspiration for the novel was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox\">teletransportation paradox</a>â€”a thought experiment pondering the philosophy of identity that challenges certain notions of the self and consciousness. It started as a short story about what Ashton called \"a crappy immortality\" and expanded from there into a full-length novel.</p>\n<p>Ashton <a href=\"https://nerdist.com/article/mickey7-edward-ashton-interview-bong-joon-ho-sci-fi/\">told Nerdist</a> last year that Bong's adaptation would \"change a lot of the book,\" but he considered the director a \"genius\" and wasn't concerned about those changes. The basic premise remains the same. Robert Pattinson plays the space colonist named Mickey Barnes, who is so eager to escape Earth that he signs up to be an \"expendable\" without reading the fine print.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050633#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050633&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"337b63ffc2ea576355963c1af3484630fd954f1ca9ea99dd601ba1b2b8638268","category":"Tech"}
