{"title":"New Specialized Riprock is a kids’ mountain bike built to stoke tiny shredders","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-specialized-riprock/","date":1635264048000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/10/Riprock-20-29ed33b.jpeg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>Specialized has overhauled its Riprock kids’ bike, updating the geometry and ditching the suspension fork to make this a shred-ready trail bike for children.</p>\n<p>Having been first released in 2016, the new Specialized Riprock now takes its geometry cues from the brand’s full-sized bikes, with a slacker head angle across the range, designed for children aged from four to 12 years old.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts from £599 / $650 for the 20in rigid model and rises to £649 / $700 for the 24in bike. There’s also the top-of-the-range, suspension-equipped Rockrider 24 Expert for $1,500.</p>\n<h2>Ditching suspension (mostly)</h2>\n<p>As we learn more about what’s the best way to start <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/beginners-guide-to-cycling-with-kids/\">cycling with kids</a>, including the more recent emphasis on balance bikes – such as the (admittedly very expensive) <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-hotwalk-carbon-balance-bike/\">Specialized Hotwalk</a> released last year – Specialized has opted for a lightweight rigid fork on both the Riprock 20 and Riprock 24, compared to the previous model’s 60mm travel fork.</p>\n<p>(We’ve got a guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/guide-to-kids-bike-wheel-sizes/\">kids’ bike wheel sizes</a> if you want to see where your child fits).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Both the 20in and 24in size options feature a rigid fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>This switch yields a significant weight saving, which is crucial for young riders, where minimising bike weight is key.</p>\n<p>The smallest Riprock 20 model weighs in at a claimed 10.2kg, according to Specialized. Getting the basic mountain bike skills dialled without suspension is now generally accepted to be a smart route.</p>\n<p>“We designed the new Riprock to give young riders everything they need and nothing they don’t,” says Eric Fischer, product manager for Specialized kids’ bikes.</p>\n<p>“Most young riders don’t need suspension forks, and by offering a rigid fork, we’re able to dramatically reduce the bike weight, which ultimately results in a more positive experience for smaller, less powerful riders.”</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s 100mm travel on offer up front on the Expert model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>More experienced and confident riders can work up to the Riprock 24 Expert model, featuring a 100mm Manitou fork for trail progression and young riders starting to tackle those more technical features.</p>\n<h2>Geometry update</h2>\n<p>Taking design cues from Specialized’s full-sized range, frame updates include shortened chainstays, a slackened head tube angle and shorter stack heights.</p>\n<p>Specialized says these changes put a greater level of control into the hands of your budding shredder, without losing that nimble ride feel.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n
