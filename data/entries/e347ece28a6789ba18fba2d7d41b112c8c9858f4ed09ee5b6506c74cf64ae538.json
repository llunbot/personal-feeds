Last year, the big team news was the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bike-check-kyle-straits-custom-ari-superior-peak-for-red-bull-rampage/\" target=\"_blank\">addition of Kyle and Rachel Strait to the family</a>. Now, there’s another big name being added to the roster – Tyler McCaul. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Tyler announced that for the first time in 16 years, he would no longer be riding for GT bikes. That’s not surprising considering <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gt-bicycles-pausing-brand-shutting-down/\" target=\"_blank\">GT Bikes announced that they were “pausing” the brand</a> back in December. In the video above, T-Mac says that the brand is officially closing down, so it sounds like at least from the sponsored athlete perspective, GT is not coming back the way it was. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately for Tyler, Ari has scooped up the talented rider and has given him the ability to continue to ride and compete. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ari Bikes Bentonville</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Interior-Sketch-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"983\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Interior-Sketch-1536x983.webp\" alt=\"Interior Sketch\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Interior-Sketch-1536x983.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Interior-Sketch-297x190.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Interior-Sketch-120x77.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Interior-Sketch-768x492.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Interior-Sketch-2048x1311.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0204-Photoshopped-Rendering-2-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"782\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0204-Photoshopped-Rendering-2-1536x782.webp\" alt=\"ari bikes bentonville rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0204-Photoshopped-Rendering-2-1536x782.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0204-Photoshopped-Rendering-2-297x151.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0204-Photoshopped-Rendering-2-120x61.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0204-Photoshopped-Rendering-2-768x391.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0204-Photoshopped-Rendering-2-2048x1043.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bentonville-Signage-Mockup_White.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bentonville-Signage-Mockup_White-1536x550.webp\" alt=\"Bentonville Signage Mockup_White\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bentonville-Signage-Mockup_White-1536x550.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bentonville-Signage-Mockup_White-297x106.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bentonville-Signage-Mockup_White-120x43.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bentonville-Signage-Mockup_White-768x275.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bentonville-Signage-Mockup_White-2048x733.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big news for Ari is the announcement of their first satellite location – in Bentonville, AR, where else? With the area continuing to explode as a popular year-round destination for riders of all skill levels, Ari plans to leverage that with bike demos, guidance for finding the right bike and riding zones, a full-service shop, and the ability to pick up your new bike or have it shipped straight to your door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ari Bikes Bentonville is expected to open this summer.
