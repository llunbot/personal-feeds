Current Switch Pro Controllers, which do not physically attach to the Switch, should be fully compatible with the Switch 2, according to the report.</p>\n<p>Vandal cites several unnamed accessory and peripheral makers who reportedly got to touch the new console inside of an opaque box, which was used to balance design secrecy with the need to provide general knowledge of the unit's dimensions. According to those sources, the Switch 2 will be \"larger than the Switch, although without reaching the size of the Steam Deck.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020227#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020227&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc13afcdb01a9c012fa335735fae46374af65c01a55f67d92959090c02f39f6c","category":"Tech"}
