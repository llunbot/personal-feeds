Previously only the latter card could be used, so the addition of Mastercard means Instant Transfer is more accessible to users who want to quickly transfer money from an Apple Cash balance to a bank account without having to wait for the transaction to be processed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says that beginning August 26, 2021, the cost of making an Instant Transfer will change to 1.5% (previously 1%) of the transfer amount, with a minimum fee of $0.25 and a maximum fee of $15. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf users don't want to use Instant Transfer, they can also transfer money to their bank account using ACH and receive it within one to three business days with no fee. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo make an Instant Transfer, open the Wallet app and select your Apple Cash card, then tap the three-dotted icon. Tap Transfer to Bank, enter an amount, and select Instant Transfer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently only available in the United States, Apple Cash can be used to make and receive payments in Messages, or you can get <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> to send money to a friend or family member. \r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-an-apple-cash-card/\">How to Set up an Apple Cash Card on iPhone and iPad</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\nWhen someone sends you money, it goes on your virtual Apple Cash card, which is stored securely in the Wallet app on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. You can use the money on it to send to someone, make purchases using ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ in stores, within apps, and on the web. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-cash/\">Apple Cash</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/apple-cash-instant-transfer-mastercard/\">Apple Cash Instant Transfer Now Works With Mastercard Debit Cards</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-cash-instant-transfer-now-works-with-mastercard-debit-cards.2306689/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NaWKO1zMwC8:YrsJ8codm0M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NaWKO1zMwC8:YrsJ8codm0M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NaWKO1zMwC8\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fe064d5933c9202a2c7d0a1670a9477b46fe055874d6330e23f5d478c71c991","category":"Apple"}
