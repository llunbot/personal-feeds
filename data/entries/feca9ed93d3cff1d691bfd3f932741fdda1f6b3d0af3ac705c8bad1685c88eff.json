The increase in emitted electromagnetic radiation observed over time by regulators appears to have been the result of successive software updates issued by Apple, and was not present when the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12 was launched in 2020.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ANFR ordered Apple to \"remove the ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12‌ from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit\" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. The agency also told Apple to recall every ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12‌ it has ever sold in the country. Ministers later said that though the radiation level was above the accepted standard, it was not dangerous and people were safe to continue using the phones, local media reported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple later said it would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-iphone-12-software-update-france-radiation/\">issue a software update</a> for ‌iPhone‌ 12 users in France to address the radiation concerns. The French regulator ANFR responded by saying it would test the software update. If it made a difference to the electromagnetic waves the device emitted, ANFR said it would bring the model into compliance with European standards applied in France, and the marketing withdrawal order would be lifted.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/\">France</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-software-update-approved-iphone-12-france/\">Apple iOS Update to Fix iPhone 12 Radiation Levels Approved by French Regulators</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ios-update-to-fix-iphone-12-radiation-levels-approved-by-french-regulators.2405456/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"feca9ed93d3cff1d691bfd3f932741fdda1f6b3d0af3ac705c8bad1685c88eff","category":"Apple"}
