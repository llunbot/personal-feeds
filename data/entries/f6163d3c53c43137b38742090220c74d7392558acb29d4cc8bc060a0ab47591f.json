I know the exact day because I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1655572613157068809\">tweeted about\nit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This morning, though, I discovered that Twitter has restored a\nhandful of my old re-tweets; interactions I <em>know</em> I scrubbed from\nmy profile. Those re-tweets were gone. I remember surveying my\nbare timeline with satisfaction before thinking, “great, time to\ndraw attention to myself.” But now they’re back. You can see them\nby scrolling down my timeline past May 8th, with even more\nappearing if you select “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjvincent/with_replies\">tweets with replies</a>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Twitter is far from alone being a service where “deletion” needs dick quotes around it. This bug is bad and likely will soon be fixed, but the persistence of ostensibly deleted tweets is a profound design flaw.</p>\n\n<p>(The nightmare scenario: a bug that exposes DMs — which infamously are not encrypted — publicly.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/twitter-bug-deleted-tweets\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f6163d3c53c43137b38742090220c74d7392558acb29d4cc8bc060a0ab47591f","category":"Tech"}
