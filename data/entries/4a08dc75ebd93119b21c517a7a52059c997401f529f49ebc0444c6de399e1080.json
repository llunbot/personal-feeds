We shared dozens of tech <a href=\"https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/204\">adventures</a> together, but those adventures were cut short when he died of cancer in 2013. Thanks to a new AI image generator, it turns out that my dad and I still have one more adventure to go.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, an anonymous AI hobbyist discovered that an image synthesis model called <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/\">Flux</a> can reproduce someone's handwriting very accurately if specially trained to do so. I decided to experiment with the technique using written journals my dad left behind. The results astounded me and raised deep questions about ethics, the authenticity of media artifacts, and the personal meaning behind handwriting itself.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, I'm also happy that I get to see my dad's handwriting again. Captured by a neural network, part of him will live on in a dynamic way that was impossible a decade ago. It's been a while since he died, and I am no longer grieving. From my perspective, this is a celebration of something great about my dad—reviving the distinct way he wrote and what that conveys about who he was.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045545#p3\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045545&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a08dc75ebd93119b21c517a7a52059c997401f529f49ebc0444c6de399e1080","category":"Tech"}
