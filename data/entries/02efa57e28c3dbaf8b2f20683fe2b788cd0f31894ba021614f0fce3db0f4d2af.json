Indeed, Gurman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1698898144011190411?s=20\">speculates</a> that sustainability will be a \"larger than normal\" part of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">\"Wonderlust\" September 12th event</a>, where it is expected to unveil its new iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, and a second-generation Apple Watch Ultra, among <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/iphone-15-apple-event-four-other-announcements/\">other possible new products</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-hermes/\">Apple Watch Hermès</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-watch-leather-bands-discontinued-rumor/\">Apple Watch Leather Bands May Be Discontinued for Series 9</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-leather-bands-may-be-discontinued-for-series-9.2400483/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"02efa57e28c3dbaf8b2f20683fe2b788cd0f31894ba021614f0fce3db0f4d2af","category":"Apple"}
