While this isn't a particularly steep discount, it is one of the first times we've tracked any deal on the AirTag 4-Pack, so if you've been holding off now is a great time to buy the accessory.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-13112648?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airtag-4pk-6%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_5\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$4 OFF</div>AirTag 4-Pack for $94.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe AirTag 4-pack comes with a one year Apple Manufacturer Limited Warranty, and has a delivery estimate between October 13 and October 15.

This starts with the Powerbeats Pro at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598\"><strong>$159.95</strong></a>, down from $199.95 in Black, Cloud Pink, Glacier Blue, Ivory, Lava Red, and Navy.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$40 OFF</div>Powerbeats Pro for $159.95</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a match of the previous Amazon all-time low price, and overall the second-best price we've ever tracked on the headphones. This deal will last one day only, and expire later tonight.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, you can get the Beats Studio Buds for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SV8SJG\"><strong>$124.95</strong></a>, down from $149.95 in Black, Red, and White.
