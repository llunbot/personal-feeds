These COVID-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html\">do not cause \"shedding\" or pose any risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to others</a>.</p>\n<p>The school, the Centner Academy, is well-known for its anti-vaccine rhetoric and vaccine misinformation. The academy notes that it is against all vaccine mandates and does not require any immunizations for its students, citing \"<a href=\"https://centneracademy.com/our-vaccine-policy\">freedom of choice</a>.\" Without evidence, it links routine, safe, and life-saving childhood vaccinations to the rise of a variety of health conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccines-and-other-conditions/vaccines-diabetes\">diabetes</a>Â and offers to help parents obtain exemptions from state vaccine requirements. Like many anti-vaccine groups, Centner plays up fears of harms and falsely suggests that there have been insufficient safety studies on vaccines. Centner's tuition ranges from <a href=\"https://centneracademy.com/2021-22-tuition-fees\">$15,000 to $30,000 per year</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805009#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805009&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5f759c73848ea1aebf12606d8ef8bc2107e814da56e322e4733831ed4ed1325","category":"Tech"}
