The result is the Ultra, which has deep, truncated aerofoil tubes throughout, high levels of integration, and is specced with aerodynamic wheels and components on all builds.</p>\n<p>As for how fast it is, Ribble claims the Ultra offers an “11.6 watt saving at 22mph across the average of 5 and 10 degrees of yaw” over <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/ribble-endurance-sl-disc/\">Ribble’s Endurance SL Disc</a> road bike, which, Ribble says, makes it “75.1 seconds quicker over 40km”.</p>\n<p>To ensure it’s as good for amateurs as it is for the pros, Ribble says the Ultra has been aero tested at two speeds – 22mph (10 metres per second) and 29mph (13 metres per second) – with time gains being more significant at the slower speed.</p>\n<p>As always with Ribble, prices are very competitive, starting at £3,199 for a build equipped with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-105-r7000-r7020-groupset-review/\">Shimano 105 R7020</a> and Level carbon wheels.</p>\n\n<h2>Return of the aero bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ribble’s new Ultra aero road bike is aggressively aero optimised.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As you’d expect, the extensively aero-optimised frame and fork feature all the hallmarks of modern aero road bike design.</p>\n<p>The frame has deep, truncated aerofoil tubes, a narrow head tube and, of course, dropped seatstays.</p>\n<p>The lower section of the down tube also flares out dramatically to manage the airflow around a water bottle – the assumption being the vast majority of riders will typically carry at least one water bottle when riding.</p>\n<p>The down tube is similar in approach to that of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-systemsix-hi-mod-etap-axs-review/\">Cannondale’s SystemSix aero bike</a>, although the taper of the aerofoil near the head tube is more dramatic on the Ribble.</p>\n<p>The fork was subject to extensive development too, with multiple different aerofoil profiles, tube depths and stance widths tested.</p>\n<p>Although UCI rules allow for fork blades up to 80mm deep, Ribble settled on 68mm×15mm fork blades (having also tested 56mm blades). Though Ribble’s testing showed the 80mm fork blades were more aero below 10 degrees of yaw, performance dropped off dramatically at wider yaw angles.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0017-22dd48b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The head tube on the Ultra is kept narrow to reduce frontal area.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0014-3833adb.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The stance width of the fork follows the width of the front wheel axle, and the seatstays are placed in the wake of the fork’s legs.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0025-80e8778.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Deep, truncated aerofoil tubes are used throughout the frameset.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0021-cdbed67.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The down tube flares out dramatically around the water bottle mounts, to help smooth the airflow over a standard, round water bottle.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0024-9775d38.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Dropped seatstays and an aero seatpost are de rigueur for a modern aero road bike.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0028-1e9abb4.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The fork also hides the front brake caliper from the wind.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nRibble says it tested both narrow and wide fork designs, but found aligning the fork blades with the front wheel axle width was the optimum solution. So much so, in fact, that Ribble claims the fork profile begins to generate lift / negative drag (or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-canyon-aeroad/\">the sailing effect</a>, as it’s also known) beyond 5 degrees of yaw.\n<p>The non-driveside fork leg is also shaped to hide the front brake caliper from the airflow, improving the airflow over a component that isn’t typically optimised for aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<p>The seatstays were also placed in line with the fork blades, to further reduce their drag at low yaw angles.</p>\n<p>To recap, yaw is “<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bikeradar-builds-simons-planet-x-exocet-2-time-trial-bike/\">the angle of attack of the wind on a cyclist</a>”. A straight-on headwind is a yaw angle of 0 degrees, and crosswinds have positive or negative values depending on which side the wind is coming from. The faster you ride, the lower yaw angles you’ll typically experience, and vice versa.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Ribble_Ultra_WindTunnel_3_XL-c644545.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ultra is the result of three years worth of CFD, wind tunnel and real-world development and testing.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ribble</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Ribble_Ultra_WindTunnel_2_XL-7c89f27.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ultra was wind tunnel tested with not one…</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ribble</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Ribble_Ultra_WindTunnel_4_JossLowden_XL-b2ec0af.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>But two different riders, and…</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ribble</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Ribble_Ultra_WindTunnel_1_XL-84a42b0.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>A dummy rider.

Realising this means a bike’s handlebar subsequently influences the airflow over the rider’s body behind it, Ribble designed the Ultra Bar to manipulate the airflow over the rider rather than simply slice through the air as cleanly as possible.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0015-72414ca.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ultra Bar has large bulges near the stem to help manipulate the airflow over the rider.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0036-fbf3fd1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ultra Bar has large, truncated aerofoil tops.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0023-b09d3f0.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The tops of the Ultra Bar are clearly designed for aerodynamic efficiency, first and foremost.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThis airflow manipulation is achieved via what Ribble calls “wake generators”. In a nutshell, the top of the handlebar bulges dramatically in the central portion closest to the stem, meaning they have a larger impact on the airflow behind them compared to traditional aero road handlebars (which tend to have tops that are slim and flat).\n<p>This apparently means, in a straight wind tunnel shootout with no rider involved, the Ultra Bar actually creates more aerodynamic drag than a more traditionally shaped aero handlebar.</p>\n<p>Crucially, though, the situation is said to flip once a rider is involved, leading to an overall drag reduction for the rider plus bike system.</p>\n<p>With a rider in place, Ribble claims the Ultra SL R equipped with the Ultra Bar is “20.5 seconds quicker over 40km at 22mph” than the same bike equipped with Ribble’s current Level 5 integrated handlebar.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shape of the handlebar affects the airflow over the rider behind it, leading Ribble to create an innovative new handlebar that reduces system drag compared to a standard aero road handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<p>In addition to this, the Ultra Bar is only available in widths of 33cm, 36cm or 38cm (centre to centre at the brake hoods – the drops flare out by 2cm on either side).</p>\n<p>That’s narrow compared to what we’re used to seeing specced on off-the-shelf bikes. A 56cm/medium frame, for example, normally comes with a 42cm handlebar.</p>\n<p>The idea is to promote an aerodynamic riding position (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/aero-bike-test-notes/\">switching from a 42cm handlebar to a 36cm one could save up to 12 watts at 45kph</a>), though riders who prefer something wider could theoretically swap it out for the Level 5 integrated handlebar because the Ultra frameset is also compatible with that handlebar.</p>\n<p>The narrowest, 33cm width was specifically designed for Ribble’s sponsored professional teams, Ribble Weldtite Pro Cycling and Drops–Le Col, and is paired with a 140mm stem length for the kind of long and narrow <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-position/\">riding position</a> increasingly favoured by riders at the top of the sport.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Ribble_Ultra_RapidPrototype_5_XL-7718c0f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ultra Bar uses a direct-mount system for attaching the brake levers without the need for round clamps, as shown on this prototype.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ribble</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0033-30741d3.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The brake levers mount directly onto the Ultra Bar with no band clamp and the drops are designed for use without bar tape.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0046-64249c6.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>This cover hides the brake lever clamping bolt.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/20210810_AX6300_DSC0035-4ba366f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Cables route through the Ultra Bar and into the frameset, leaving nothing exposed to the wind.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe innovations don’t end there, though. In order to move away from the shaping restrictions of round, 23.5mm brake lever clamps, Ribble has designed a new direct-mount solution (also patent-pending) for attaching the brake levers to the Ultra Bar.\n<p>This design does away with the traditional metal clamping band found on brake levers and instead sees the brake levers bolt directly onto the handlebar.</p>\n<p>This means the clamping area of the Ultra Bar can be made more aerodynamic than on a standard handlebar, which needs to be 22.2mm and round to accommodate a standard 23.5mm brake lever clamp.</p>\n<p>The system is said to work with any standard brake lever, and the reshaped, non-round drops are claimed to be both more aerodynamic and more ergonomic.</p>\n<p>Ribble has also covered the drops with a kind of grippy paint, which is said to negate the need for handlebar tape, for another small aero gain (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-slippery-should-your-aero-road-bars-be/\">adding handlebar tape adds a small but measurable amount of aero drag</a> by increasing frontal area).</p>\n<h2>Builds, pricing, weight and availability</h2>\n<p>Just like Ribble’s current Endurance road bike platform, the Ultra will be available in two options.</p>\n<p>First, there’s the top-tier Ultra SL R, then there’s the cheaper Ultra SL.

A painted, size medium Ultra SL frame is claimed to weigh 1,200g, while an equivalent Ultra SL R comes in at 1,050g.\n<p>This results in Ultra SL R builds starting from 7.6kg at the top end of the pricing scale, which is competitive with the current crop of aero road bikes.</p>\n<p>One obvious difference is that while all SL R builds get the innovative Ultra Bar described above, the SL builds are specced with Ribble’s Level 5 integrated aero handlebar.</p>\n<p>Prices start at an attractive £3,199 for an Ultra SL build with Shimano 105 R7020 and Level carbon wheels.</p>\n<p>If you want the Ultra Bar, prices for the Ultra SL R start at £3,899 for a build with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-ultegra-r8000-groupset-review/\">Shimano Ultegra R8020</a> and Mavic Ksyrium 30 wheels, and rise to £7,299 for a build with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9170-first-ride-review/\">Shimano Dura-Ace R9170 Di2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/enve-foundation-65-wheelset-review/\">Enve Foundation 65 carbon wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s also a triathlon-specific Ultra SL R build that costs £6,599 and comes with a tri-specific seatpost and components, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-ultegra-di2-r8050-r8070-hydraulic-groupset-long-term-review/\">Shimano Ultegra R8070 Di2</a> and Ribble’s wonderfully bonkers tri-spoke carbon wheels.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Double tri-spoke wheels on a road bike aren’t a traditional choice, but we imagine they’re pretty fast in the right conditions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<p>Full build details can be found on Ribble’s website, and exact specifications can be further customised through Ribble’s online Bike Builder tool.
