And it is one that can put an eye out, if not played with carefully and responsibly. But this really is fun to play with, and a nicely-crafted bit of silliness made with care and precision in Germany by the same framebuilders that craft Sour’s steel gravel, road &amp; mountain bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sour’s first words about it are “<em>Don’t Sue Us Please</em>” and their parting words leave a further disclaimer:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Please note: This is a toy. Please do not harm any animals. We love animals. And humans. And everything else on this planet.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sour Bicycles’ limited edition steel Sweet ‘n Sour Slingshot</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sour Bicycles limited edition steel Sweet 'n Sour Slingshot, up close with bottle opener\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_up-close-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I first noticed these last winter, after the framebuilders of Sour Bicycles in Dresden, Germany decided to make themselves a slingshot to play with in their downtime. And then, everybody who saw it said they wanted one, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Sour decided to make a batch and see if anyone would actually pay for a handcrafted steel slingshot. And thus, the Sweet ‘n Sour Slingshot was born. Of course, they sold out, and I thought that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, in the lead-up to the holiday gifting season, Sour decided to resurrect the Sweet ‘n’ Sour Slingshot in all of its glory, including its built-in bottle opener – for responsible adult beverages while responsibly shooting at safe targets. So there’s a pre-order now for 2 weeks, and they’ll ship slingshots out to everyone who buys one now, in time to wrap it up and gift it to a lucky individual on your Christmas shopping list!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Review: Why a slingshot isn’t a bad idea</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sour Bicycles limited edition steel Sweet 'n Sour Slingshot, pinecone ammo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_plinking-cans-with-pinecones-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, a 70€ hand-crafted slingshot made by professional bike frame-builders is undeniably a luxury item. And to be fair, at least a little bit dangerous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, this is one of the most affordable handmade products that you’ll get out of bike builder. And it is legitimately fun for the whole family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you first need to figure out what you are shooting a Sweet ‘n Sour Slingshot at before you go out and order one. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_target-practice-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_target-practice-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sour Bicycles limited edition steel Sweet 'n Sour Slingshot, fun family target practice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_target-practice-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_target-practice-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_target-practice-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_target-practice-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_target-practice-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a couple of big old European Larch trees in our yard, so we have hundreds of their cones all over the lawn. And every time a strong wind blows, old dead branches with cones still attached fall and need to be picked up. We’ve literally got 2-3cm pinecones coming out of our ears, so the perfect ammo. Check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a couple of old metal barrels. So quickly breaking out some sidewalk chalk, and we’ve got a perfect target that produces a very satisfying gong sound the closer you get to the bull’s eye. Check, number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fun for the whole family</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_working-on-hand-eye-coordination-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_working-on-hand-eye-coordination-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sour Bicycles limited edition steel Sweet 'n Sour Slingshot, working on hand-eye coordination\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_working-on-hand-eye-coordination-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_working-on-hand-eye-coordination-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_working-on-hand-eye-coordination-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_working-on-hand-eye-coordination-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sour-Bicycles-limited-edition-steel-Sweet-n-Sour-Slingshot_working-on-hand-eye-coordination-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So now my son, my daughter, and I get to spend some extra fun time together plinking pinecones at a metal barrel. And we can all work on refining our hand-eye coordination skills, with no video games or any screentime required. Plus, now the kids have a bit more incentive to help rake up the yard. Although that hasn’t seemed to help too much, yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at least they are more willing to hunt around for little cones to shoot at the barrel or just a big pile of wood. We haven’t yet progressed to individual tin cans, but I think that will come soon enough when they start to get more competitive. Then, the real competition begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A side benefit… our young cat loves chasing after every errant pinecone as it bounces off of whatever we hit. So I guess she’s refining her hunting skills too, and won’t be turning into a fat lap cat anytime too soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know you come to Bikerumor for the deep technical details dive on everything we cover, right?

Then, they get a black powder coat, including individual multi-color splatter made by Sour’s founder Chris himself. “<em>Please Note: Since the splatter paint job is a result mainly of luck, every slingshot will look a little bit different.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sour slingshot features a 31mm diameter soft clear Frozen push-on mountain bike grip made by Freeze, also in Dresden, so you get to see more of Chris’ luck of the splatter. A tough set of tubular rubber hose bands secured with steel ball bearings hold the synthetic leather pouch to propel your ammo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It measures 24cm long x 11cm wide (9.4×4.3″) and will weigh down your back pocket about 286g, ready for target practice and opening a brew or two when you are done.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sour’s ltd.
