The Move, Exercise, and Stand activity summaries include the same +/- button that lets you adjust the goal for just today, or adjust your schedule for each day of the week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, if you tap the main Activity Rings display on Apple Watch, there's also a new Pause Rings option that mutes coaching and goal tracking while maintaining your Move streak. So if you're aiming for a streak and something unexpected upends your efforts (if you fall ill, for example) you can pause tracking without losing out and having to start again.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/fitness-app-activity-goals-schedule.jpg\" width=\"4377\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\nYou can initiate a pause for just today, until next week, for the whole month, or until a date of your choosing. Currently, you can pause your rings for up to 90 days and resume at any time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌watchOS 11‌ is in developer beta, so it's worth noting that some features could always change or be removed completely before Apple releases the new Apple Watch software in the fall.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/watchos-11-custom-activity-goals-different-days/\">watchOS 11 Lets You Schedule Activity Goals for Each Day of the Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-lets-you-schedule-activity-goals-for-each-day-of-the-week.2429523/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"11368fa4ddf1c7c298cfe824aa00813594223a13107dd342ec1eacb74781a23d","category":"Apple"}
