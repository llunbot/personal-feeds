Here's how to take advantage of these new tools.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Generic-iOS-18-Maps-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Using the New Library</h2>\r<br />\nApple's iOS 18 update brings significant improvements to the Maps app, and streamlines the process of saving and organizing your favorite locations. Building on the existing Guides feature, the new version introduces a simple \"+\" button on location listings for quick saving.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA new Library menu now houses all of your saved places, including those from Guides and Pinned locations. The Library also automatically incorporates previously saved locations, offering a comprehensive view of your favorite spots.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-library.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nYou can individually search through your Pinned, Places, Guides, and Routes collections, and use the three-dot button to sort them by date added, name, or distance, and toggle between list and grid views. The update also enables direct saving of new locations from within the Library itself, via the <strong>+ Add</strong> button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn summary, the new Library consolidates content that was previously spread across different sections of the app, which makes your saved place information a lot more accessible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Adding Notes to Locations</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18 also introduces the ability to add personal notes to any location in Apple Maps. This feature allows you to jot down reminders, impressions, or any other information you want to associate with a specific place. To add a note:\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n  <li>Search for or tap on a location in Maps.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap the <strong>More</strong> button (three dots) in the location's information card.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap <strong>Add a Note</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Type your note, then tap <strong>Done</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-maps-add-note.jpg\" alt=\"maps\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYour notes are private and stored only on devices logged into your Apple account. This feature can be particularly useful for remembering details about restaurants, marking meeting spots, or keeping track of places you want to visit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese new features in iOS 18's Maps app offer enhanced organization and personalization, and there are other additional tools checking out that we've covered elsewhere, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-maps/\">custom routes, hiking trails</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-search-here-feature-apple-maps-ios/\">new Search Here function</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-add-place-notes-apple-maps-library/\">iOS 18: Use New Library and Notes Features in Apple Maps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-use-new-library-and-notes-features-in-apple-maps.2440030/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5d1c8d2aa4f7153bd06102c14dc4627b9e8206bfebbdeaf13dda138dc0df24b9","category":"Apple"}
