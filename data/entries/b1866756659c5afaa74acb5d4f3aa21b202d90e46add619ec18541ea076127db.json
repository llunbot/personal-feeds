Apple is expected to launch the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup in mid-September, with an announcement on the 10th being the most probable date based on the company's historical patterns. Sources speaking to the <em>Korea Times</em> claim that preparations appear to be underway for an early release in the country.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHistorically, despite the ‌iPhone‌'s strong market share in Korea, new models have been released in the country weeks after their debut in other markets. This is partly due to Apple's rigorous confidentiality policies and Korea's stringent certification system. All electronic devices in Korea must be certified by the National Radio Research Agency, and details about these devices are disclosed on the agency's website, which could lead to premature leaks of new ‌iPhone‌ specifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite these challenges, Apple appears to be reconsidering its strategy for the Korean market, driven by the country's steady demand and the potential for positive early sales. Data from Canalys claims that Apple's market share in China dropped to 14% in the second quarter of this year, down from 16% a year earlier. This decline <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/apple-drops-to-sixth-place-in-china/\">pushed Apple out of the top five smartphone vendors</a> in China, potentially providing an opportunity to reallocate inventory to other markets, such as Korea.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/koreatimes-co-kr/\">Korea Times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/south-korea/\">South Korea</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/07/iphone-16-lineup-could-launch-earlier-in-korea/\">iPhone 16 Lineup Could Launch Earlier Than Usual in Korea</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-lineup-could-launch-earlier-than-usual-in-korea.2433119/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b1866756659c5afaa74acb5d4f3aa21b202d90e46add619ec18541ea076127db","category":"Apple"}
