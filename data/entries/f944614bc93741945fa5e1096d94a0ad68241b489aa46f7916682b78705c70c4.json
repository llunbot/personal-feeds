They also come with Adaptive Noise Cancellation so you can block out the world around you and focus on work reading, or whatever it is you’re doing. You can also switch to Transparency mode to hear your surroundings, which is useful when you’re in public, crossing the street, or you have to mind your safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beats Studio Pro can keep you company for up to 40 hours of play time, which means you won’t have to charge them up very often. If you have a portable power bank on you, you can even charge them on the go if need be. A 10-minute charge will give you another four hours of playback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss out on the chance to get yourself one of the best headphones out there, especially when they’re as low as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Kardashian-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22/?th=1\">$180 at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Jam out with Beats</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Kardashian-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22/?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Get it at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f944614bc93741945fa5e1096d94a0ad68241b489aa46f7916682b78705c70c4","category":"Apple"}
