It's called \"Windows App.\" Microsoft just has a certain way with naming things.

The fact that it exists, with such a strong and simple name, says something larger than the rather plain and starting-stage app it is now.</p>\n<p>\"Windows App,\" as named by Microsoft in a rare bit of minimalism, is essentially a convenient remote desktop connection to a Windows OS on a physical system, an Azure virtual desktop, a Dev Box, or elsewhere. There are <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-app/device-audio-folder-redirection-teams?tabs=windows\">some other tricks</a> you can pull off, too, like using your local device's webcam, speakers, and printer connections with your remote Windows system. But you can easily read a \"Windows app\" for multiple platforms, including web browsers generally, as being the next step in Microsoft's slow march toward making a virtual Windows OS something that seems convenient for everybody, whether on a business or personal account.</p>\n<p>At the moment, you need a work or school account with Microsoft to use most of the features beyond a traditional remote desktop connection. To use a remote desktop connection, the Windows instance you're connecting to must be running a Pro edition, as Home lacks the ability to host a remote desktop connection. There are, of course, many ways to connect to a remote PC from nearly any device, including <a href=\"https://www.realvnc.com/en/\">RealVNC</a> and others.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984393#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984393&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2873b959bad863fadc14b01365f4126f819def88021d7a4a9fef347ca1816afe","category":"Tech"}
