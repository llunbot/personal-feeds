But the company waited until today <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/21/new-platforms-new-players-xbox-games-switch-playstation/\">to confirm</a> the names of the four soon-to-be-multiplatform titles.</p>\n<p>The Xbox games coming to other consoles in the coming months are (multiplatform launch date in parentheses):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Pentiment</em> (Feb. 22, Switch, PS4/5): <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/pentiment-preview-obsidians-historical-religiously-charged-murder-mystery/\">Obsidian's historical murder mystery</a> has a sprawling narrative that reacts strongly to player choices.</li>\n<li><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> (March 9, Switch, PS5): A rhythm-action game from Bethesda Softworks where you have to match your attacks and movements to the beat to maximize your impact.</li>\n<li><em>Grounded</em> (April 16, PS4/5): Obsidian's co-op survival adventure will be fully cross-play compatible across all platforms.</li>\n<li><em>Sea of Thieves</em> (April 30, PS5): Despite <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/sea-of-thieves-makes-a-weak-meandering-first-impression/\">what we considered a poor first impression</a>, Rare's pirate-themed multiplayer simulation has attracted 35 million players so far, according to Microsoft. This title will also be cross-play compatible across platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Microsoft's announcement comes just after <em>Grounded</em> and <em>Pentiment</em> were announced for Switch as part of the morning's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ER2hl7HUWI\">Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase</a> video stream, the timing of which likely prevented Microsoft from announcing its plans for those titles last week. There wasn't a lot of drama to today's announcement, though; both <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity\">The Verge</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1758220881283944903\">independent journalist Stephen Totilo</a> cited anonymous sources in accurately naming all four games just after Microsoft's presentation last week.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005050#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005050&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cdf6de5424fe3d1eff1c084ebb972d33e9ae284fd9033fe1aec9715a13c23481","category":"Tech"}
