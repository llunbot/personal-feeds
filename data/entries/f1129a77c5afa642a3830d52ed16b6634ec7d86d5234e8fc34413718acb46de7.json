A link pivoting concentric to the bottom bracket is connected to the swingarm via another link that also drives the rear shock, while the main pivot sits high on the seat tube. An idler pulley routes the chain line close to the main pivot to minimize chain growth and its associated undesirable effects on suspension performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched with 140mm of rear wheel travel, the later availability of an aftermarket link allowed riders to boost that to 150mm.

All sizes run the very same swingarm to give a consistent 441mm rear-center length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seat tubes remain impressively short at 430mm on the size large, and are straight and uninterrupted to allow for the fitment of long travel dropper seat posts. Also notable is the much lower standover delivered by the front triangle’s new shape, now at 685mm on the size large, down from 731mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/action-shot-riding-deviate-highlander-2-drive-side.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Highlander II Kinematic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The suspension kinematic of the Highlander II offers up no real surprises.

The Highlander II grows its effective rear-center length as it is pushed through the compression stroke, increasing by a whopping 23mm at 145mm. Such an axle path is excellent at delivering rear wheel forces into a suspension linkage where they can be most effectively damped by the rear shock. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs-800x626.jpg\" alt=\"deviate highlander 2 anti-rise anti-squat kinematic graphs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs-800x626.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs-297x232.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs-120x94.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs-768x601.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs-1536x1202.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deviate-highlander-2-anti-rise-anti-squat-kinematic-graphs.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An anti-rise of around 130-135% indicates the suspension will compress under heavy rear braking, which will concomitantly lengthen the wheelbase to provide stability in such scenarios. Anti-squat remains relatively consistent throughout the travel; most relevant at the sag point, it sits at just over 120%, indicating the shock will extend under pedaling-induced accelerations, a characteristic that could help provide traction on steep, technical climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Highlander II Frame Details</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-deviate-claymore-is-a-165mm-travel-high-pivot-enduro-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">165mm Claymore</a> enduro bike, the Highlander II benefits from double-row, angular contact max fill bearings. These are protected with twin-lip wiper seals at every single frame pivot, and on the bearing that the idler pulley sits on. All of these also feature grease ports, allowing the owner to refresh grease in the bearings without any disassembly required.
