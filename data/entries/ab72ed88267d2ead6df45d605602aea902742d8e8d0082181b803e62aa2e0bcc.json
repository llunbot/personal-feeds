The move is expected to save Apple $35–50 million annually and supports the company's efforts to increase its manufacturing presence in India. Apple's assembly operations in the country, conducted through its partners like Foxconn, have grown significantly in recent years, with 14% of all iPhones now being produced in India. Foxconn has recently invested in new manufacturing plants in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, further boosting production capacity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe reduction in import duties is part of India's broader strategy to enhance its role in the global supply chain, particularly in the electronics sector. Apple continues to import a significant number of its premium models, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, into India. The reduced import duties will make these high-end models more affordable for Indian consumers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe country's official economic survey for 2024 also highlights the positive impact of initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the Districts as Export Hubs (DEH) program. These programs have attracted substantial foreign investment, leading to increased local manufacturing capabilities.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-expansion-in-india-to-accelerate/\">Apple's Expansion in India Set to Accelerate Thanks to Duty Reductions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-expansion-in-india-set-to-accelerate-thanks-to-duty-reductions.2432130/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab72ed88267d2ead6df45d605602aea902742d8e8d0082181b803e62aa2e0bcc","category":"Apple"}
