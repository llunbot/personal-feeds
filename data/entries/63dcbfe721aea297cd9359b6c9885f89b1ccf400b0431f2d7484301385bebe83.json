{"title":"Tour de France Femmes: Behind the Scenes & Power Meters!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/08/france-femmes-behind.html","date":1723754998000,"content":"<p>xxxVIDEO</p>\n<p>The women’s Tour de France is in full swing this week, and most notably, in my country of residence: The Netherlands. That’s made it super easy to check things out this year, on a few different stages – both regular road and time trial. For today’s post, we’ll look at a road stage, and then in tomorrow’s(ish) post, I’ll dive into a time trial stage, including some team car bits and more!</p>\n<p>Above is an initial behind the scenes video covering all sorts of things, including the following bits of interestingness:</p>\n<p>– How Shimano Neutral Service inventories each team’s bikes at the start<br />– Kristen Faulkner’s new bike setup post-Olympic gold medal<br />– …and pairing of said new bike/power meter to her new golden Wahoo BOLT (in the middle of the team zone)<br />– Laundry machines, obviously<br />– The reason why one team had smart trainers out for a non-TT stage<br />– Which teams are using power meter pedals<br />– Which teams are rolling-up at the last second<br />– A group of women cyclists following the Tour…except starting in Germany.<br />– A really big squirrel gives me a hug<br />– A look at Puck’s handlebar daily artwork, outlining the stage details (current KOM holder)<br />– All sorts of totally other random things</p>\n<p>Basically, it’s what happens when you give me a camera for 2 hours and I just want to geek out on the randomness of pro cycling in the team zone. Or essentially, what I always do at the Tour de France, men’s or women’s.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC_3342.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3342.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3342.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3342-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3342-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, a lot of that is in pursuit of inventorying sports tech, and today was power meter day. As is often the case, the choices among the women’s side are far more interesting. For the men’s side, it’s basically pick one: Shimano or SRAM (with a side dish of a single SRM team). But for the women’s side, the world is your oyster! We’ve seen everything from Favero to Garmin to SRM to 4iiii to Stages in the past. And that largely holds true here too.</p>\n<p>At a high level, here’s the run-down:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Shimano (crank arms):</strong> 8 teams<br /><strong>SRAM (spider):</strong> 6 teams<br /><strong>FSA/Power2Max (spider):</strong> 4 Teams<br /><strong>Garmin Rally (power pedals):</strong> 1.5 Teams<br /><strong>4iiii (crank arm):</strong> 1 Team<br /><strong>Look (power pedals):</strong> 0.5 Team<br /><strong>SRM (spider):</strong> 0.5 Team</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To me, the big stand-out here is actually FSA/Power2Max (virtually entire due to the FSA side), they’ve slowly but surely grown their pie over the last few years. Power2Max makes a good product, and FSA is leveraging that well (as they have for years).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC_3271.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3271.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3271.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3271-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3271-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, at this point, some of you are like ‘WTF’, half a team? Well, hopefully this next bit makes it a bit more clear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Arkéa–B&amp;B Hotels Women: </strong>Shimano <strong><br />Ceratizit–WNT Pro Cycling:</strong> Shimano<br /><strong>FDJ–Suez:</strong> Shimano<br /><strong>Fenix–Deceuninck:</strong> Shimano<br /><strong>Liv AlUla Jayco:</strong> Shimano<br /><strong>Lotto–Dstny Ladies:</strong> Shimano (+ a couple FSA/Power2Max)<br /><strong>Team dsm–firmenich PostNL:</strong> Shimano<br /><strong>UAE Team ADQ:</strong> Shimano</p>\n<p><strong>Canyon–SRAM:</strong> SRAM/Quarq<br /><strong>Human Powered Health:</strong> SRAM/Quarq<br /><strong>Lidl–Trek:</strong> SRAM/Quarq<br /><strong>Movistar Team:</strong> SRAM/Quarq<br /><strong>Team SD Worx–Protime:</strong> SRAM/Quarq<br /><strong>Visma–Lease a Bike:</strong> SRAM/Quarq</p>\n<p><strong>EF–Oatly–Cannondale:</strong> FSA/Power2Max<br /><strong>Roland Cycling:</strong> FSA/Power2Max<br /><strong>St. Michel–Mavic–Auber93:</strong> FSA/Power2Max<br /><strong>Uno-X Mobility:</strong> FSA/Power2Max (+ couple Garmin Rally) </p>\n<p><strong>AG Insurance–Soudal:</strong> Garmin Rally<br /><strong>Cofidis:</strong> Half Look pedals, Half SRM<br /><strong>Laboral Kutxa–Fundación Euskadi:</strong> 4iiii (single-sided)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s a few teams that had riders with Garmin Rally pedals floating around (some Shimano-based teams, some nothing-based), and then one team that’s in the process of converting over to Look’s power meter pedals (just as they are on the men’s side, given sponsorships).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC_3248.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3248-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3248-1.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3248-1-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3248-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Those teams that had Garmin Rally, were teams that were sponsored by Garmin at-large (bike computers, trainers, etc…), but not ones where I saw Garmin Rally on all bikes. Virtually all of Garmin’s pro-level cycling sponsorships of major TdF teams are limited to the non-power stuff, at least publicly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC_3258-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3258-Enhanced-NR-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3258-Enhanced-NR-1.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3258-Enhanced-NR-1-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3258-Enhanced-NR-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Garmin has noted they’re happy to sponsor the power meter side, but Shimano/SRAM largely block that, via drivetrain sponsorships.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC_3263.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3263.jpg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3263.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3263-200x134.jpg 200w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC_3281.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3281.jpg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3281.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3281-200x134.jpg 200w\" /></p>\n<p>Inversely, we saw no Wahoo-based power meter pedals this year (in terms of widespread sponsorships, perhaps I missed a bike somewhere in the 180 or so riders), whereas in the past both Wahoo and Favero had sponsored teams. But again, this is often driven by drivetrain sponsorships more than anything. There’s no meaningful resistance to power meter pedals in the WorldTour peloton today, like there was 8-10 years ago. Heck, given the Shimano accuracy issues, many teams *are* using power meter pedals in training (where they can get away with it, from a contract standpoint).</p>\n<p>I did see a surprise 4iiii team though, which I was not expecting. Albeit, all single-sided units.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DSC_3262.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3262.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3262.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3262-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/08/DSC_3262-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>In any event, more to come with all the details from the time-trial stage, including a few surprises and firsts on the smart trainer side of things.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned, and thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"63dcbfe721aea297cd9359b6c9885f89b1ccf400b0431f2d7484301385bebe83","category":"Cycling"}
