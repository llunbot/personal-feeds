Calling it a logical progression from the light but powerful motor &amp; battery systems that keep their drones in the air, the DJI Avinox system powers eMTBs with 105Nm max torque from a motor that weighs just 2.5kg. That makes Avinox the lightest full-power eMTB drive I know of, and just about half a kilo heavier than the lightest motors that put out around half as much torque. And with energy-dense battery tech, DJI promises full-power ebikes as light at 19.2kg with all-day range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DJI Avinox lightweight, full-power ebike drive system</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB.jpg\" alt=\"all-new DJI Avinox ebike lightweight drive system full-power motor, rigin the new Amflow PL Carbon eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_loose-loam-on-the-all-new-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/DJI)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>DJI says they are going to “redefine the electric mountain bike (eMTB) experience” with their all-new Avinox ebike drive system. With a unique combination of industry-leading torque, light motor weight, light &amp; energy-dense battery tech, and smart automated pedal-assist modes, the new DJI Avinox ebike drive system looks poised to make a splash in the growing eMTB market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, we’re a little hesitant any time a new company appears out of the blue with a complex technical product going head-to-head with established industry powerhouses. But it’s true that DJI knows how to build powerful electric motors and batteries. And no one needs to make electric drive systems lighter and more efficient than a company used to flying them in the air. So, our interest is truly piqued to see how DJI can adapt their battery-powered drone expertise into battery-powered ebikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components.jpg\" alt=\"all-new DJI Avinox ebike lightweight drive system full-power motor, system components\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_eMTB-system-components-2048x1024.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“DJI’s legacy of passion for innovation, as well as our expertise in battery and motor technology accumulated in drones and camera stabilization systems, have led us to the creation of Avinox.

DJI says it puts out a max 105Nm of torque and a peak of 850W of power assist (of course, 250W nominal power to meet pedal-assist regulations.) And yet delivering industry-leading power, the Avionox motor is claimed to weigh just 2.51kg, making it the lightest full-power motor we’ve seen. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside.jpg\" alt=\"all-new DJI Avinox ebike lightweight drive system full-power motor, exploded view with composite planetary gears\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside-1536x614.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside-768x307.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_exploded-view-with-composite-planetary-gears-inside-2048x819.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To hit that light of a weight, DJI says the Avionox motor uses “high-performance polymer gears” inside its ‘compound planetary gearset’. Not just powerful and light, Avionox also promises a “remarkably quiet ride”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Smart pedal-assist modes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_riding-a-eMTB-wheelie-in-the-jungle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_riding-a-eMTB-wheelie-in-the-jungle.jpg\" alt=\"all-new DJI Avinox ebike lightweight drive system full-power motor, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_riding-a-eMTB-wheelie-in-the-jungle.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_riding-a-eMTB-wheelie-in-the-jungle-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_riding-a-eMTB-wheelie-in-the-jungle-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_riding-a-eMTB-wheelie-in-the-jungle-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_riding-a-eMTB-wheelie-in-the-jungle-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key element leveraging DJI’s drone motor and stabilized video tech is smart pedal-assist modes. Instead of just their conventional Eco, normal riding Trail, and high-power Turbo modes, DJI Avinox adds a new algorithm-tuned Auto mode. “Designed for broad adaptability and long-range use, the Auto mode utilizes multi-sensor fusion to automatically and continuously adjust assistance based on riding resistance.” DJI Auto promises a longer range than just running Trail or Turbo, but still gives you powerful pedal-assist when you need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, for those moments when you want to go full gas, there’s a 5th Boost mode, that surges output to the Avinox’s peak 850W power for a few seconds, at the push of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A companion DJI ebike app gives the rider customization control over assist levels and ride feel for each mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Big batteries and fast charging</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery.jpg\" alt=\"all-new DJI Avinox ebike lightweight drive system full-power motor, 600Wh or 800Wh battery inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_600Wh-or-800Wh-internal-battery-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While light assist eMTBs have generally opted for &lt;500Wh batteries and many full-power ebikes have expanded to &gt;1000Wh, DJI strikes a balance in the middle. Their standard go-to is an 800Wh internal battery. But there’s also a 600Wh option for building eMTBs that blur the boundaries between lightweight and full power. Whatever way the eMTB designer goes, DJI employs “GaN 3x fast charging 1” tech in their chargers so you can charge your ebike quickly. DJI says their 12A/508W fast charger can bring the bigger 800Wh battery from 0% to 75% charge in just 90 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>An integrated interface</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display.jpg\" alt=\"all-new DJI Avinox ebike lightweight drive system full-power motor, 2&quot; full-color OLED touch-screen display\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive_toptube-2-inch-full-color-OLED-touch-screen-eMTB-display-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All the power, control, and range come together in a sleek package with a tidy 2″ full-color touchscreen OLED display in the top tube.

So the first complete eMTB that will feature the new DJI Avinox ebike drive system is the Amflow PL. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/All-new-2024-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-with-DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive-system_angled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/All-new-2024-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-with-DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive-system_angled.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Amflow PL Carbon all-new 150/160mm eMTB equipeed with new DJI Avinox ebike drive system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/All-new-2024-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-with-DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive-system_angled.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/All-new-2024-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-with-DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive-system_angled-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/All-new-2024-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-with-DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive-system_angled-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/All-new-2024-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-with-DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive-system_angled-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/All-new-2024-Amflow-PL-Carbon-eMTB-with-DJI-Avinox-ebike-drive-system_angled-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An independent upstart bike manufacturer incubated by DJI, Amflow just launched a carbon 150/160mm all-mountain ebike with the DJI system that will be available later this year in Q4 starting around 7000€ and with complete weights as low as 19.2kg in a more expensive spec. Check out our separate coverage of the Amflow PL Carbon here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Amflow at launch, DJI confirms that they are in discussions with other established ebike manufacturers. And if the ride feel, torque, power, and weight claims stand up, we’d bet a bunch of ebike makers will be jumping to stick a DJI AVinox motor in their eMTB frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.dji.com/avinox\" target=\"_blank\"> DJI.com/Avinox</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dji-avinox-105nm-ebike-motor-evolves-drone-tech-into-mega-power-at-2-5kg-lightweight/\">DJI Drone Tech Evolves into Mega eBike Power w/ Lightweight 105Nm Avinox Motor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3fcdd8fab3abf82efb6f362020973d29a87a04bafa7bc53d0559bce307bcfc9a","category":"Cycling"}
