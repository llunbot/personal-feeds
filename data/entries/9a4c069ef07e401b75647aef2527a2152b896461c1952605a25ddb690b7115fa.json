In the wake of the essay's publication, the Federal Aviation Administration launched an investigation of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/10/tech/blue-origin-safety-review-whistleblower-scn/index.html\">these safety allegations</a>.</p>\n<p>Now the conflagration has spread to SpaceX. On Tuesday, Lioness <a href=\"https://www.lioness.co/post/at-spacex-we-re-told-we-can-change-the-world-just-don-t-try-to-stop-the-sexual-harassment\">published another essay</a> by Ashley Kosak, a former mission integration engineer at SpaceX. This essay has fewer anonymous co-signers (only two) and is more tightly focused on sexism rather than the company's broader culture. But in regard to harassment, its allegations are no less worrisome. Kosak writes about multiple occasions of feeling sexually harassed and her belief that SpaceX's management did not do enough to intervene.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820661#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820661&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a4c069ef07e401b75647aef2527a2152b896461c1952605a25ddb690b7115fa","category":"Tech"}
