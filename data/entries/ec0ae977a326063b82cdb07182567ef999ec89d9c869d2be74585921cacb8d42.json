It’s been an action-packed week culminating in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-gravel-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel World Championships</a> races and<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/il-lombardia\" target=\"_blank\"> Il Lombardia</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=19020&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While there was no live coverage for the women’s race – and we’ll get into that below – Kasia Niewiadoma (Poland) won through a solo attack, with Silvia Persico (Italy) and Demi Vollering (Netherlands) completing the podium. Matej Mohorič (Slovenia) won the men’s race ahead of Florian Vermeersch (Belgium) and Connor Swift (Great Britain). </p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=24&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Il Lombardia marked the last Monument of the season as road racing winds down, and who else would win but <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>? The Slovenian accelerated away on the Selvino descent to win back-to-back-to-back editions of the race. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thibaut-pinot-tour-de-france-2023-stage-20\">The last dance: Thibaut Pinot’s closing act</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\">Opinion: Tadej Pogačar is the Greatest Of All Time</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/5-best-thibaut-pinot\">Cyclist’s 5 favourite Thibaut Pinot moments</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Kasia Niewiadoma and Matej Mohorič win at Gravel Worlds</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-970x648.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-970x648.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-1536x1026.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-2048x1368.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-750x501.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-1140x761.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Kasmia-Niewiadoma-wins-Gravel-Worlds-by-UCI-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, Niewiadoma won the women’s Gravel World Championships race. Allegedly. There was no live coverage of this. In 2023. In contrast, the men’s event on Sunday won by Mohorič received 90 minutes of live coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After backlash, the UCI posted a statement during the women’s race, saying: ‘The UCI has been informed by the Local Organising Committee of the 2023 UCI Gravel World Championships in Veneto that today’s Women’s Elite race will not be broadcast live due to no TV production.’ The statement also confirmed it would be ‘mandatory for event organisers to provide TV production’ for both the men’s and women’s Gravel World Championships races next year. Why it wasn’t mandatory for the 2023 edition remains unclear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niewiadoma won her maiden rainbow jersey with a 20km solo attack launched on the final climb. Behind, Silvia Persico (Italy) and Demi Vollering (Netherlands) completed the podium. In the men’s race, Mohorič also won through a solo attack. He distanced breakaway companions Connor Swift (Great Britain) at around 24km to go and Florian Vermeersch (Belgium) at the 18km mark. Vermeersch held on for silver as Swift evaded the chasing group to take home the bronze medal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mark Cavendish signs new one year contract</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-970x647.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-astana-qazaqstan-2.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Astana Qazaqstan</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish</a> returns to the pro peloton. In May, the 38-year-old announced his plan to retire at the end of the season but he has now signed a one-year deal with Astana for 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was looking forward to not having to get up and train every day and not to be away from home for such a long time. I love cycling, I love racing, however I was happy with that decision. Obviously crashing out of the Tour de France was not the finish of my career that I hoped for. It is what it is. Alexander Vinokourov said to me after my crash, “Why don’t you do another year?” and my first reaction was not to change my decision. I was at peace with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Then, I discussed it with my family, my kids and I got their answer: “You should carry on.”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news reignites the will he/won’t he debate surrounding the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> stage victory record he currently shares with Eddy Merckx, tied on 34 wins apiece. Before the postponed retirement, Cavendish’s Tour de France career ended with a broken collarbone after crashing out on Stage 8 this year. Now, the Astana team has bolstered its strength for 2024 by signing Michael Mørkøv as Cavendish’s lead-out man in the sprints.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-retirement-delay\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish delays retirement to race for one more year in 2024</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tadej Pogačar wins Il Lombardia </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-970x647.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>UCI</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadej Pogačar is already legendary but he cemented his status even further this weekend. Not only did he win Il Lombardia for the third time, but he did it consecutively, joining Alfredo Binda and Fausto Coppi as the only riders to complete such a feat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar began to accelerate away on the Passo di Gando summit and Selvino descent. His gap swelled to over a minute in the final kilometres and no one could reel him in. 52 seconds behind, the chasing group’s sprint resulted in Andrea Bagioli (Soudal-QuickStep) and Primož Roglič claiming the last podium places. This was Roglič’s last race for his Jumbo-Visma team as he joins Bora-Hansgrohe next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-peter-sagan\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič to leave Jumbo-Visma</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thibaut Pinot retires </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"cyclist in blue kit smiles in glowing sun\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-tour-de-france-2023.jpeg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Groupama-FDJ</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the topic of last races… goodbye, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/thibaut-pinot\" target=\"_blank\">Thibaut Pinot</a>. Thank you for such an enthralling career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 33-year-old Frenchman retired from professional cycling as he crossed the finish line of Il Lombardia in Bergamo. Pinot won the Monument in 2018 and has taken stages in all three Grand Tours over the years, but he also won hearts with his emotional riding style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t wait to see more of his farm content as he enjoys time away from the bike. But don’t be too disheartened – it’s likely we’ll see him at the roadside enjoying a passing race with his Thibaut Pinot fanclub next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thibaut-pinot-tour-de-france-2023-stage-20\" target=\"_blank\">The last dance: Thibaut Pinot’s closing act</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-lombardia-2023\">Pro Log: No live coverage for the women at Gravel Worlds, Cavendish returns, Pogačar wins Il Lombardia and Pinot retires</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ec0ae977a326063b82cdb07182567ef999ec89d9c869d2be74585921cacb8d42","category":"Cycling"}
