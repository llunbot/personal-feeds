We are expecting the software to go live at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is when Apple typically releases updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-Update-Available-Next-Week-With-New-Features-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nLast week, Apple seeded release candidates (RCs) for all of the upcoming software refreshes. Apple usually tests RCs for about a week to make sure there are no device-breaking bugs, and this time around, we're also clued in on a specific launch date because of an update in France.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.1 in France includes a feature to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/ios-17-1-launch-by-october-24/\">reduce the radiation level</a> of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 12 models when they are stationary on a table or another surface, and French regulatory group ANFR two weeks ago confirmed that the iOS 17.1 update is expected to come out \"by October 24.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.1 isn't going to bring us the Journal app, but it does have some useful new features. It includes the option to continue large AirDrop transfers over the internet once initiated, so if you're sending someone files, you can walk away while the transfer is in progress.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt includes new options for favoriting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> songs, there are new options for leaving the display on in StandBy mode, and Screen Time should work better across devices. There are also several bug fixes, so if you've been having issues with search in the Messages app or persistent images on the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models, you're going to want to download the update right away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you have an Apple Watch, it's actually watchOS 10.1 that's going to bring some of the best features. The update includes support for NameDrop for quickly sharing contact info with another person, and it adds Double Tap on the latest models. Double Tap lets you tap your index finger and thumb together to do things like answer phone calls and bring up the Smart Stack.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sonoma‌ 14.1 has a few bug fixes, and if you have an original ‌HomePod‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, you'll be pleased to hear that ‌HomePod‌ 17.1 adds the Enhance Dialogue feature to these devices. When a ‌HomePod‌ is used as an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> speaker, Enhance Dialogue cuts down on background noise and music when there's speaking so you can better hear what's being said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have a full rundown on all of the new features coming in iOS 17.1 in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-1-beta-features/\">iOS 17.1 beta features guide</a>. Apple is already working on iOS 17.2, so we could be seeing new beta features as soon as later this week after iOS 17.1 and its sister updates come out.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/ios-17-1-likely-to-launch-tomorrow/\">iOS 17.1 Likely to Launch Tomorrow</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-likely-to-launch-tomorrow.2408441/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ef24e8fbf794bb32506ad9c477d217e55755060aab97dc63b45a1cd3d8c5b4a7","category":"Apple"}
