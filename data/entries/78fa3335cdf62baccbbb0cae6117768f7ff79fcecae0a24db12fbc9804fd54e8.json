He said there were reasonable disagreements among engineers at NASA, which is the customer for the spaceflight, and Boeing, which developed and operates Starliner, about the viability of the 28 reaction control system thrusters that are used for delicate maneuvering and pointing of the vehicle.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041586#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041586&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78fa3335cdf62baccbbb0cae6117768f7ff79fcecae0a24db12fbc9804fd54e8","category":"Tech"}
