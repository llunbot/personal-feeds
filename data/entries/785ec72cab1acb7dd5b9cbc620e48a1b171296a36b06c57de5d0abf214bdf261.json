When stored carbs are depleted, your body starts to convert fat into ketones. Studies show that ketones are 28% more efficient than glucose, making them a super-efficient fuel source for the brain and the body.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These benefits led H.V.M.N to create Ketone-IQ: a drinkable ketone designed to support energy, focus and endurance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Developed alongside the U.S. military, Ketone-IQ is one of the most powerful ketone supplements on the market. It’s designed to elevate your ketone levels for up to 4 hours – much longer than other products. Plus, it’s vegan, caffeine free, and compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s guidelines. That’s a major win for athletes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ketone-IQ Shots are the best way to get your ketones on the go. They’re portable, convenient, and fit perfectly in your pocket during a ride or a race.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can save 30% on Ketone-IQ using the promo code CYCLIST at  <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST\" target=\"_blank\">hvmn.com/CYCLIST</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about achieving your ultimate metabolic potential, subscribe to H.V.M.N’s podcast ‘Health Via Modern Nutrition with Dr. Latt Mansor’ on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube. <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/?sscid=91k7_qvnwj&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">See hvmn.com</a> for more details</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/neah-evans-cyclist\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 88: Winning gold with Neah Evans</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"785ec72cab1acb7dd5b9cbc620e48a1b171296a36b06c57de5d0abf214bdf261","category":"Cycling"}
