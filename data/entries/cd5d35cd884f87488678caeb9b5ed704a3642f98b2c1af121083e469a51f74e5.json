Apple hasn't actually implemented reverse wireless charging until now, and the way that it works with the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ is limited in scope.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, the ‌iPhone‌ has to be plugged in for the charging feature to work, but it's certainly a step in the right direction and hints at more expansive reverse wireless charging capabilities in the future. Given the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌'s reverse wireless charging feature, it seems technically possible that an ‌iPhone 12‌ could deliver power to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, but Apple has not yet implemented this feature. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has suggested that ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ users might want to use the ‌iPhone‌ passthrough charging feature when the ‌iPhone‌ is connected to a power source like wired <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> and is able to charge both accessories. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-reverse-charging/\">Apple's MagSafe Battery Pack Unlocks Long Rumored Reverse Charging Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-unlocks-long-rumored-reverse-charging-feature.2304163/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MbJUm7wtgDc:mR9WoCPyi5s:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MbJUm7wtgDc:mR9WoCPyi5s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MbJUm7wtgDc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cd5d35cd884f87488678caeb9b5ed704a3642f98b2c1af121083e469a51f74e5","category":"Apple"}
