Affected users say the speaker audio becomes quiet or muffled over time, even after using the Water Lock feature to eject water from the speaker following swimming or another water activity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe low volume affects both phone calls and music, according to the complaints.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear how widespread this issue is, or if there is an underlying hardware or software problem. If a hardware issue affects enough customers, Apple sometimes opts to launch a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/service-programs\">service program</a> offering free repairs. If a software issue is discovered, then Apple should be able to address it with a future watchOS update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Watch Series 10 models launched in September 2024. I was unable to replicate the issue on my Apple Watch Series 10, but I have only owned it for about six weeks and have not used the speaker much, as I tend to use AirPods Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have reached out to Apple for comment about this matter, and we will update this post in the unlikely event that the company responds.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-watch-series-10-speaker-issue/\">Some Apple Watch Series 10 Users Experiencing Speaker Volume Issue</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-apple-watch-series-10-users-experiencing-speaker-volume-issue.2449174/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"02f8724cc0fb99da8c98bc6c2e07818e3fea99a44b28e5f557cbbb20bb2c78a1","category":"Apple"}
