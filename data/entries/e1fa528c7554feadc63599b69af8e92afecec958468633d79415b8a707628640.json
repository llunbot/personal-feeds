This week two charging networks have announced that they're going to add support for the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard connectors. On Wednesday, Blink revealed that it integrated NACS into its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/\">level 2 and DC fast chargers</a>. Today, it was Electrify America, the country's largest non-Tesla charging network, which will also add NACS plugs to its charging stations.</p>\n<p>Tesla opened up the latest version of its charging protocols to the wider auto industry in November 2022, renaming it the North American Charging Standard as it did so. For a few months, nothing much happened, but in late May, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/ford-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/\">Ford signed a deal to adopt NACS and obtain access to Tesla's Supercharger network</a>. Two weeks later, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/gms-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/\">General Motors</a> followed, then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/rivian-is-the-next-automaker-to-adopt-teslas-charging-plugs/\">Rivian</a>, and most recently, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/now-volvo-is-switching-to-teslas-charging-plug/\">Volvo joined the club</a>.</p>\n<p>At first, the move <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/with-ford-and-gms-help-tesla-reignites-the-charging-standard-war/\">raised eyebrows from some industry watchers</a>. It appeared that Ford, GM, and others were putting a hugely important aspect of their customers' EV experience into the hands of a rivalâ€”one run by a CEO known for impulsive, often rash decisions like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/08/elon-musk-tweets-he-has-funding-to-take-tesla-private/\">suggesting making Tesla private again</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/tesla-announces-35000-model-3-is-closing-its-stores-to-pay-for-it/\">deciding to close all its retail stores</a>, both whims that were later backtracked.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951096#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951096&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
