{"title":"Rumor Suggests Low-Cost Ninth-Generation iPad to Debut at Apple Event Later Today","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/low-cost-ipad-debut-apple-event/","date":1631606925000,"content":"A new rumor suggests that Apple may debut its updated baseline ninth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> later today, as part of several new product announcements for its \"California streaming\" event.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/iPad-9th-gen-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6734482564/Ky0Ek8Jkt\">Weibo account @PandaIsBald</a>, who has shared information regarding <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> pre-order dates <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/iphone-13-launch-sept-17-chinese-report/\">in the past</a>, Apple plans to release the new ninth-generation ‌iPad‌ during or possibly after today's event. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌iPad‌, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/9th-gen-ipad-this-fall-gurman/\">previously reported</a>, is expected to feature a 10.5-inch display, improved performance, and like the current model, it's expected to be tailored towards students and customers wanting an affordable ‌iPad‌ option. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe event is expected to headline the ‌iPhone 13‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-7/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, and possibly the third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>. While those products are likely to be featured during the event itself, Apple may decide to release other products via press releases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman this week indicated that Apple is planning a second event for this fall that will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/gurman-apple-second-event-new-macs-ipads/\">focus purely on the iPad and Mac</a>. The ninth-generation ‌iPad‌ is one of two ‌iPad‌ updates expected before the end of the year. The other update, a new and redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, is the more significant refresh, making it conceivable that Apple could dedicate its latter event to the ‌iPad mini‌ while releasing the more incremental baseline ‌iPad‌ refresh sooner.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://appletrack.com/ahead-of-tomorrows-appleevent-the-329-ipad-is-mysteriously-unavailable/\">As noted</a> by the website <em>AppleTrack</em> earlier today, the current eighth-generation ‌iPad‌ is still unavailable in several retail stores in the United States. Shortages for the ‌iPad‌ began to become apparent last week. A number of Apple products, including Macs, iPhones, and iPads, are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-products-delayed-shipping-times/\">currently experiencing shortages</a> due to the ongoing chip shortage. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhether or not the new ‌iPad‌ makes an appearance during the company's \"California streaming\" event, Apple still has plenty in store to share.
