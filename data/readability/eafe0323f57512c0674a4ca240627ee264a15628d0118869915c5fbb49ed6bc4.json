Or to make it aerodynamic. And quite another to make it do both.</p><p>But when it needs to do all of those things and meet the required safety standards, that’s where things get tricky. Fortunately, Giro has a lot of experience, and the man in charge of tying all those pieces together is Rob Wesson.
