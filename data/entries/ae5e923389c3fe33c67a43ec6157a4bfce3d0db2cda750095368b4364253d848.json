What it can do, however, is simulate enough of the universe to appear more intelligent than it really is.\"</p>\n<p>Lebling's quote comes up first in a chapter about <em>The Oregon Trail</em>.

When you inevitably perish, it asks you about \"a few formalities we must go through,\" accepting Y/N for each.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948253#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948253&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae5e923389c3fe33c67a43ec6157a4bfce3d0db2cda750095368b4364253d848","category":"Tech"}
