And this year’s hot new color might have a little retro flair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over on X (formerly Twitter), <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/vnchocotaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=61&amp;t=jv1PIlPi0JXTW2QJrnOc7w&amp;xcust=1-1-2279877-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">ShrimpApplePro reports</a> that a Weibo account that was previously accurate in predicting iPhone colors has spilled the beans on the hot new finish coming to the iPhone 16 Pro this year. The tipster claims Apple will introduce a new Rose color that appears to be a throwback to the iPhone 7 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the $10,000 rose gold Apple Watch Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/226314/rose-gold-a-hot-seller-as-iphone-6s-preorders-start.html\">introduced the rose gold color on the iPhone 6S</a>, followed by the iPhone SE and iPhone 7. It quickly became one of Apple’s hottest colors, but while Apple has released several gold-colored iPhones since then it hasn’t released any more rose gold models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As has been previously reported, the new color will replace the iPhone 15 Pro’s Blue Titanium. The source also says Natural Titanium will be replaced with a grayer shade while Black Titanium will be similar to the iPhone 14 Pro’s Space Black hue, likely to match the M3 Pro and Max MacBook Pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all of the latest information on the iPhone 16, follow our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">dedicated roundup</a> of all the new features, specs, and, of course, colors.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d67fc6d057ed8c5eff0c097b420e53906ce9ff4e6426b8e869d6a9988738e463","category":"Apple"}
