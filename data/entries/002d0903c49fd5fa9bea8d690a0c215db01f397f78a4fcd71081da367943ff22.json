It's January 11, and today's image showcases a diffuse nebula known as NGC 7538, found in the constellation Cepheus.</p>\n<p>Located some 9,000 light-years from Earth, the nebula is a region of active star formation and produces a large amount of hydrogenâ€”which shows up in this image. The nebula contains a shockingly large protostar that is, <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...715..919S/abstract\">astronomers estimate</a>, some 300 times larger than our Solar System and has a mass of 2,000 Suns. Even as astronomical objects go, that's gargantuan.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995207#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995207&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"002d0903c49fd5fa9bea8d690a0c215db01f397f78a4fcd71081da367943ff22","category":"Tech"}
