The complete handlebar package with aerobars would set you back an impressive £8,500.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the bike, there’s an SRM crankset fitted with a Pyramid Cycle Design chainring, which from the creases on its surface appears to be made from carbon fibre. While Pyramid Cycle Design normally makes custom alloy chainrings, many riders are now opting for low-friction carbon fibre rings, as Lowden seems to have done.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 64-tooth chainring is made by Pyramid Cycle Design and appears to be carbon fibre.

This is a massive gear but it helped Lowden keep a lower <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a> than would be desired for other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/track-cycling-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">track cycling events</a> as this is said to help keep your heart rate lower.</p>\n<p>Lowden ran an Izumi KAI chain, which during coverage of the attempt was said to be one of the fastest chains Wattshop has tested.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Single-sided Speedplay Aero pedals provided some extra watt savings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Alexander</i></span></div>\n<p>The record attempt also doubled as an opportunity for sponsor Le Col to show off its Le Col x McLaren Project Aero Skinsuit.
