Bikerumor.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I caught up with the new Pinarello Dogma XCs of Tom Pidcock and Pauline Ferrand-Prevot in Nové Město na Moravě, I was first surprised to see such tidy integration into their cross-country race bikes – just one small wire exiting the fork crown and just one wire coming off a slightly larger control box on the rear shock. But really caught my eye was what was missing – the system had no external buttons, no display, and no bulky external control units or battery. These two top riders obviously could trust that the automated suspension control would work so reliably, that they couldn’t even deactivate it during a race if they felt they weren’t getting the most out of the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, knowing that just one 3-axis accelerometer controls the entire system makes that even more impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What makes up an automated TACT suspension setup?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"SR Suntour TACT automatic electronic XC MTB racing suspension, system diagram\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram.jpg 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram-297x283.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram-800x762.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram-120x114.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram-768x731.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram-1536x1463.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_system-diagram-2048x1950.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

From that input data and a 1-8 TACT support level preselected by the rider via a mobile app, the suspension automatically opens and locks out to maximize efficiency – varying both fork &amp; shock low-speed compression depending on need, not just fully open or fully locked but also a medium in-between pedal platform mode, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all happens so fast – a claimed 4 milliseconds – that the suspension apparently remains active on technical climbs to absorb every impact but is able to stiffen itself up as the rider’s pedal stroke comes down again, or the moment they get out of the saddle to stomp up a climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to think about the suspension at all. Just pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype SR Suntour TACT e-suspension, unreleased automatic electronically controlled XC MTB suspension, Tom Pidcock INEOS racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SR Suntour tells us that on the technical 3.8km long XCO course in Nové Město, Pidcock’s TACT suspension automatically changed position 150 times each lap. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup.jpg\" alt=\"SR Suntour TACT automatic electronic XC MTB racing suspension, mobile app setup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_TACT-App-mode-setup-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c. SR Suntour</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT suspension still requires a regular air pressure setup to dial in rider weight (with the compression settings open), and you still get external rebound adjustment to tune in for the desired terrain. Then in the SR Suntour TACT companion app on a mobile phone, the rider picks a level from 1-8: 1 &amp; 2 offering max comfort, middle settings balancing comfort with efficiency, and 7 &amp; 8 prioritizing XC-race-ready pedaling efficiency above all else. But once it is set via built-in Bluetooth connectivity, the TACT system does not require a mobile phone or app to function. It is always on – activated by movement, and returning to sleep mode when the bike doesn’t move – and will stay in the preset mode until you change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumor is that the pro racers tend to stay near the higher numbers, but sometimes pick a lower TACT Mode level for more technical racecourses – <em>think</em>: maybe 8 for XCC &amp; 6 for XCO.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details &amp; Who is it for?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype SR Suntour TACT e-suspension, unreleased automatic electronically controlled XC MTB suspension, Tom Pidcock air time XCC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Pidcock-XCC-airborne-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT is a fully-automated electronic 3-position low-speed compression suspension control system – open, medium, firm – that operates both front &amp; rear suspension from a single sensor and single processing unit – an example of SR Suntour’s refined simplicity guiding principle… “<em>high performance made simple</em>“. TACT is a standalone system that does not need any other device to control it, but it can be custom configured via an iOS/Android mobile app. It is offered on the 100/110/120mm Axon 34 Werx Boost EQ 29er fork and the Edge TT rear shock (available in 165×40/45mm, 190×40/45mm &amp; 185×50/55mm). Total additional weight compared to a non-electric cable-activated remote suspension lockout system front &amp; rear is an extra 198g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, XC racing is the most obvious application since it has been raced to 4 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sr-suntour-tact-auto-electronic-suspension-from-world-cup-to-you-prototype-sneak-peek/\" target=\"_blank\">XCO World Cups</a> and an <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sr-suntour-shows-prototype-electronic-suspension-on-tom-pidcocks-gold-medal-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic XCO Gold medal</a> all by Tom Pidcock in the last two years.
