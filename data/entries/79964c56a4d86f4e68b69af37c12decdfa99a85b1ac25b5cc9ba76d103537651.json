Here's How to Cancel Your Apple TV+ or Apple One Subscription","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/cancel-apple-one-subscription/","date":1698266529000,"content":"Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/\">today announced</a> significant price hikes for several of its services, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a>+. Because of the higher individual prices, the cost of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a> bundles have also increased.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-TV-Arcade-and-News-Price-Increase-Feature-2-Purple.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1404\" />\r<br />\nIn the U.S., ‌Apple TV+‌ is now $9.99 per month, up from $6.99 per month. ‌Apple Arcade‌+ is up $2 at $6.99, and ‌Apple News‌+ is now priced at $12.99 per month, up from $9.99 per month. ‌Apple One‌ Individual and Family are $3 more expensive, while Premier is $5 more. Prices are going up in most countries where Apple services are available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-One-Services-Youd-Like-to-Keep-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIf you're unhappy with the new price points for Apple's services, it's quick and easy to cancel. Here's how on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>:\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n \t<li>Open up the Settings app.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap on your profile picture.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap on Subscriptions.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>If you have ‌Apple One‌, tap on \"Cancel All Services\" to end your subscription for every service. If you want to pick and choose certain ones to keep, tap on \"Choose Individual Services.\"</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>If you have individual subscriptions, tap on one of the subscriptions and choose the \"Cancel Subscription\" option.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap on \"Confirm\" to go through with the cancelation.</li>\r<br />\n</ol>\r<br />\nAfter your subscription is canceled, your services will continue to be accessible until your next billing date. So if you paid for a year of ‌Apple TV+‌, for example, it will be available until what you've paid for expires. ‌Apple One‌ can only be purchased on a monthly basis, so you'll have a month at most before access runs out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you need to cancel your subscription on your Mac, the process is similar. Open the System Settings app, click on your profile picture, select Media &amp; Purchases, and choose \"Manage\" under the Subscriptions option. From there, you can follow the same steps listed above.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's increased prices start today for new subscribers, but Apple is offering existing subscribers a 30-day grace period. After that 30 days, existing subscribers will see the new prices on their next renewal date. Apple is likely to send out emails ahead of the price hikes.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/cancel-apple-one-subscription/\">Upset With Apple's Price Increases?
