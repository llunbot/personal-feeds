And the latest report claims it will have a very high price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">According to Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple’s first folding iPhone is “expected to retail above $2,000 and $2,500.” That would make it the most expensive iPhone ever made and rival some high-end MacBook Pro configurations. It’s also more expensive than the Galaxy Z Fold6, which retails for $1,600.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says the device will be a “true AI-driven Phone … enabling scenarios like chatting with a chatbot about travel plans while viewing a full map app simultaneously.” Reports say Apple’s “conversational” Siri which was expected to launch in iOS 19 has been delayed to iOS 20 and won’t launch until 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as the specs, Kuo says the phone will have “a book-style design” with a 5.5-inch outer display that opens to a 7.8-inch display. Of note, he claims the screen will be totally crease-free with a stainless steel and titanium alloy hinge. He says the phone will measure between 9mm and 9.5mm thick when folded and 4.5mm to 4.8mm when unfolded. By comparison, Oppo’s Find N5, which is the world’s thinnest folding phone, measures less than 9mm when folded, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is 8.25mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo also says the phone will have a dual-camera setup and the front-facing camera will be accessible “in both folded and unfolded states.” And finally, it won’t have Face ID but rather use a Touch ID built into the power button like the iPad mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Kuo also says the folding iPhone is coming anytime soon. Mass production in late 2026, putting the launch sometime in 2027. And that’s without any delays, which has already pushed the timeline back years.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a9644374a5217edfc61079189eb440440a0df377fccc71bd38676a0af89499af","category":"Apple"}
