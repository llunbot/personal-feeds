Last year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/automakers-may-have-to-sell-4x-more-evs-under-new-proposed-cafe-rules/\">President Biden's administration published</a> proposed new Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations for 2027â€“2030, regulations that would require automakers to sell four times as many zero-emissions vehicles as they do now.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/white-house-threatens-to-veto-anti-ev-bill-just-passed-by-us-house/\">opposition</a> to the new CAFE standards has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/car-dealers-say-they-cant-sell-evs-tell-biden-to-slow-their-rollout/\">been fierce</a>, and now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-administration-relax-ev-rule-tailpipe-emissions-ny-times-2024-02-18/\">Reuters reports</a> that the White House is backing down and will issue new guidelines with less ambitious goals in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>The White House's goal had been for US EV adoption to reach 50 percent of all new light vehicle sales by 2030, rising to 60 percent by 2032. In part, it proposed changing the modifier applied to each new zero-emissions vehicle when used to calculate an automaker's fleet emissions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004542#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004542&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
