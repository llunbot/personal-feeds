According to Apple's tech specs, the iPhone 16e offers up to 26 hours of battery life for video playback, compared to up to 22 hours for the standard iPhone 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Air-Fanned-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nA key reason the iPhone 16e has longer battery life than the iPhone 16 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">Apple's new C1 modem</a>, which is the most power-efficient modem ever included in an iPhone. All other current iPhone models are equipped with Qualcomm modems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how Apple described the C1 modem:<blockquote>Expanding the benefits of Apple silicon, C1 is the first modem designed by Apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity. Apple silicon — including C1 — the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.</blockquote>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today said the <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1892605046078259711\">iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with the C1 modem</a>, which should contribute to the device having longer battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not only the C1 modem that will boost battery life. With a large 6.6-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display/\">or 6.7-inch display</a>, there should be plenty of room inside the iPhone 17 Air for a larger battery, even with the device expected to have an ultra-thin design. So, despite being thin and light, the iPhone 17 Air's battery life might be more impressive than some may have anticipated.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-battery-life-promising/\">iPhone 17 Air's Battery Life Looks Promising Based on iPhone 16e</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-airs-battery-life-looks-promising-based-on-iphone-16e.2449800/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5229778dada1e999ba25c4adc6313ceeb7eb10d42cb6cd73de3856d14d7d67e7","category":"Apple"}
