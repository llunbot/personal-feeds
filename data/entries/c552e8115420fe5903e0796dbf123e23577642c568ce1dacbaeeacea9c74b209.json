If you'd like to tackle similar organizational projects, I've got you covered. Here are the organizational tools that I bought and the reason for my purchase.</p>\n<h2>Expandable bamboo drawer organizer</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/81hYxca8ZML.jpg\"><img alt=\"Expandable drawer insert can keep office items like pens, tools, and more organized.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/81hYxca8ZML-640x554.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/81hYxca8ZML-1280x1108.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/81hYxca8ZML.jpg\">Expandable drawer insert can keep office items like pens, tools, and more organized.</a> (credit: Amazon)</p></div>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>Pipishell Bamboo Expandable Drawer Organizer for Utensils Holder                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <a href=\"https://amzn.to/46H2LNb\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                    For $25 (was $40) at Amazon                                </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                                <a href=\"https://amzn.to/46H2LNb\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>Originally designed for eating and cooking utensils, I've used these expandable organizers before in my desk to organize my pens, cables, and tools.
