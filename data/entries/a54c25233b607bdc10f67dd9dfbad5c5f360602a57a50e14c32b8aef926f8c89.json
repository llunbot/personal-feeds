The region stores a huge amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in boreal forests and underlying soils. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/carbon-rich-peat-is-disappearing-but-is-it-also-growing/\">Organic peat soil</a>, for instance, covers just 3 percent of the Earth’s land area (there’s some in tropical regions, too), yet it contains a third of its terrestrial carbon. And Arctic <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/abrupt-permafrost-thaw/\">permafrost</a> has locked away thousands of years’ worth of plant matter, preventing rot that would release clouds of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/arctic-permafrost-obsessed-methane-detectives/\">planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane</a>.</p>\n<p>But in a pair of recent papers, scientists have found that wildfires and human meddling are reducing northern ecosystems’ ability to sequester carbon, threatening to turn them into carbon <em>sources</em>. That will in turn accelerate climate change, which is already <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-arctic-is-warming-4-times-as-fast-as-the-rest-of-earth/\">warming the Arctic four and a half times faster</a> than the rest of the world, triggering the release of still more carbon—a gnarly feedback loop.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938004#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938004&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a54c25233b607bdc10f67dd9dfbad5c5f360602a57a50e14c32b8aef926f8c89","category":"Tech"}
