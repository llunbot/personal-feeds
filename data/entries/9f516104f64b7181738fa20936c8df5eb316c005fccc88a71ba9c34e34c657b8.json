After an unexpected, major injury, people are sent to the closest hospital and aren't likely to be shopping around for the best price from the back of an ambulance. If they did, though, they might also need to be treated for shock.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018504#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018504&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f516104f64b7181738fa20936c8df5eb316c005fccc88a71ba9c34e34c657b8","category":"Tech"}
