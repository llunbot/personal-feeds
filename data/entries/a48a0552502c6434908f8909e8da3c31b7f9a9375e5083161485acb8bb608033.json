The drive uses a four-lane PCI Express 3.0 interface and was novel for being able to perform better than SATA SSDs for about the same amount of money.</p>\n<p>But that may be changing, thanks to quiet behind-the-scenes component changes: Chinese site <a href=\"https://www.expreview.com/80127.html\">Expreview</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wd-blue-sn550-ssd-performance-cut-in-half-slc-runs-out\">Tom's Hardware</a> and <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/computing/326200-western-digital-caught-bait-and-switching-customers-with-slow-ssds\">ExtremeTech</a>) says that a newer version of the drive manufactured in July 2021 was writing data at speeds of about 390MB per second after the drive's cache had filled up. According to Expreview, that's about half the speed of older versions of the SN550; Tom's Hardware measured speeds of about 610MB per second during a sustained write test on the original SN550, so the exact amount of performance degradation may vary. Because both the old and new versions of the SN550 use the same SSD controller, it seems likely that the slowdown is being caused by inferior NAND flash.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789710#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789710&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a48a0552502c6434908f8909e8da3c31b7f9a9375e5083161485acb8bb608033","category":"Tech"}
