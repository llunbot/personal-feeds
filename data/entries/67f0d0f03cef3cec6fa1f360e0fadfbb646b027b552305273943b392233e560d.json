{"title":"Industry Nine DUO Carbon Trail & Enduro Wheels Go Front & Rear Specific","link":"https://bikerumor.com/industry-nine-duo-carbon-wheels-front-rear-specific/","date":1690380000000,"content":"<p>Industry Nine has announced four new carbon wheelsets for mountain biking that conform to the brand’s so-called DUO concept, wherein different rim profiles are assigned to the front and rear wheel, tailoring them to the contrasting demands placed upon them by rider and trail. Made by We Are One Composites in Kamloops, BC, internal rim width is adjusted to the front and rear wheels to deliver comparatively more compliance out front, and comparatively more impact resistance out back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduction of the DUO Wheels is a part of Industry Nine’s complete overhaul of their current range of carbon wheels, with no fewer than eight new wheelsets announced today. XC Racing, Trail, All-Mountain, Enduro, eMTB and Freeride bases are all covered. Without further ado, here’s a quick overview of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"industry nine emtb wheelset en350\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-emtb-specific-carbon-wheelset-en350-made-in-canada-we-are-one-composites.jpg 1500w\" /></a><figcaption>Also announced today is the Hydra EN350 Wheelset with Industry Nine’s first ever eMTB specific rim featuring a 35mm internal width</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Industry Nine DUO Carbon Wheelsets</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are seeing something of a trend across mountain bike wheel manufacturers toward this front and rear-specific approach to wheel design. Indeed, Industry Nine are not the first to engineer wheelsets to take into account the contrasting load cases experienced by the front and rear wheel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While brands like Crankbothers go a step further by varying spoke count, as well as tailoring the rim profile with their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crankbrothers-synthesis-carbon-wheels-run-ft-rr-specific-rims-for-better-riding/\" target=\"_blank\">Synthesis wheelsets</a>, Industry Nine are satisfied with changes brought about by tailoring rim profile only. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the four DUO carbon wheelsets announced today, all of which run on the 690 POE Hydra hubset, the rear wheel sees a narrower internal rim width than the front wheel. Industry Nine says the new range places emphasis on pinch flat reduction, impact resistance, and ride quality improvements. Specs and pricing on each are right here.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Industry-Nine-Hydra-Trail-300-290-DUO-Carbon-Wheelset-24-hole.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Industry-Nine-Hydra-Trail-300-290-DUO-Carbon-Wheelset-24-hole-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"industry nine hydra trail 300 290 duo wheelset 24 spoke carbon rims made in kamloops we are one composites\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Industry-Nine-Hydra-Trail-300-290-DUO-Carbon-Wheelset-24-hole-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Industry-Nine-Hydra-Trail-300-290-DUO-Carbon-Wheelset-24-hole-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Industry-Nine-Hydra-Trail-300-290-DUO-Carbon-Wheelset-24-hole-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Industry-Nine-Hydra-Trail-300-290-DUO-Carbon-Wheelset-24-hole-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Industry-Nine-Hydra-Trail-300-290-DUO-Carbon-Wheelset-24-hole.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Hydra Trail 300/290 DUO – 24 Hole – XC or Light Trail Riding</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wheel Sizes: 29″</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internal Rim Width: 30mm Front, 29mm Rear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spoke Count: 24</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claimed Weight for Set: 1,550g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tire Width: 2.2″ – 2.5″</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting Price: $2,350 USD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replacing the Industry Nine TR280 wheelset is the TR300/290 DUO.

With pricing starting at $2,350 USD, there is no increased cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering a rim that is 2mm wider and 1mm deeper, the UL300 is said to give increased torsional stiffness and better tire support over the 28mm internal width rims of the UL280 wheelset, with an improved strength to width ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"725\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing-800x725.jpg\" alt=\"industry nine hydra ultralite ul300 xc wheelset carbon rims 24 spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing-800x725.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing-297x269.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing-120x109.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing-768x696.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing-1536x1392.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-ul300-carbon-wheelset-xc-racing.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Hydra Ultralite 300 – XC Racing</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wheel Sizes: 29″</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internal Rim Width: 30mm Front &amp; Rear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spoke Count: 24</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claimed Weight for Set: 1,470g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tire Width: 2.2″ – 2.5″</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting Price: $2,350 USD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-en310-275-carbon-wheelset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-en310-275-carbon-wheelset-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"industry nine hydra enduro 310 275 trail enduro wheelset carbon rims we are onw\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-en310-275-carbon-wheelset-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-en310-275-carbon-wheelset-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-en310-275-carbon-wheelset-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-en310-275-carbon-wheelset-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/industry-nine-en310-275-carbon-wheelset.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Hydra Enduro 310 – 27.5 Trail or Enduro Riding</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wheel Sizes: 27.5″</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internal Rim Width: 31mm Front &amp; Rear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spoke Count: 32</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claimed Weight for Set: 1,620g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tire Width: 2.3″ – 2.6″</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting Price: $2,380 USD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the EN325/310 DUO wheelset is only available in 29″ and MX options, riders of 27.5″ trail and enduro bikes can turn to the new EN310 wheelset, with a 31mm internal width rim on the front and the rear.
