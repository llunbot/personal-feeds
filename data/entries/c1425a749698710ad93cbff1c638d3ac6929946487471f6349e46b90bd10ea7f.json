Gordon's response to a query about the show implied that shooting had been delayed by the global health crisis.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"Our show is uniquely unsuited to shooting in pandemic times, as we have a lot of international actors and a different cast each episode,\" said Gordon. \"But we're prepping to shoot early next year.\"</blockquote>Season one, which premiered in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/17/first-season-little-america-now-on-apple-tv/\">January 2020</a>, received <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/little_america/s01\">largely positive reviews</a> from critics, many of whom called it the best ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>‌+ show available at the time.
