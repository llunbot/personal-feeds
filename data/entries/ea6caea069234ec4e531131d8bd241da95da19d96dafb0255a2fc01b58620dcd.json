Instead of a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/hands-on-nes-classic-edition-puts-old-games-in-a-very-small-package/\">miniaturized</a> N64, however, the company's first dedicated 3D-rendering console is returning as part of a software suite on Nintendo Switch.</p>\n<p>And in classic Nintendo fashion, Thursday's announcement only told some of the story.</p>\n<p>So far, we know that the initial selection of the <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/a-new-nintendo-switch-online-membership-plan-with-expanded-benefits-is-coming/\">Nintendo Switch Online \"Expansion Pack\"</a> will include nine N64 games, ranging from classics like <em>Super Mario 64</em>Â and<em> Mario Kart 64 </em>to niche surprises like <em>Winback: Covert Operations.</em> These games will require an additional fee over <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/nintendos-first-ever-paid-online-service-launches-on-switch-sept-18/\">NSO's standard $20/year rate</a>, though Nintendo has not yet announced a price for this tier. The company also did confirm plans to roll out seven more N64 games at some point, particularly Rare's <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, which hasn't been seen on a Nintendo console since Microsoft bought the developer in 2002.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798338#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798338&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ea6caea069234ec4e531131d8bd241da95da19d96dafb0255a2fc01b58620dcd","category":"Tech"}
