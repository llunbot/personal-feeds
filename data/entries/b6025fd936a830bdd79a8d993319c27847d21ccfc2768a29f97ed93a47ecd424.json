Why don’t you just stick a small tracker on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BFKN2NN/?tag=arstech20-20\"> something cheap</a> and attach it to your cat’s collar, you say? Well, that’s exactly what Tile did. At a time when Bluetooth-tracking companies should be rethinking their approach and reputation among shoppers, a Tile Sticker slapped on a cheap collar attachment feels like a wasted opportunity.</p>\n<p>It took a surprisingly long time for Tile to release an official pet tracker, but Tile for Cats finally became available Wednesday for <a href=\"https://www.tile.com/product/tile-for-cats-black\">$40</a>—$10 more than a Tile Sticker's <a href=\"https://www.tile.com/product/black-sticker\">solo MSRP</a>. Tile's announcement describes the product as the simplistic solution it is. It merely “combines Tile Sticker with a silicone collar attachment.\"</p>\n<p>And that's the first reason why Tile for Cats doesn't feel like an exciting new product—and it doesn't look like one either. If someone wanted something that looked like a DIY pet tracker, they'd probably make one. That device would also probably have something cuter written on it than \"Tile,\" like this <a href=\"https://hackaday.io/project/188224-squeak-gps-pet-tracker\">GPS pet tracker on Hackaday</a> that says \"Squeak.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935408#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935408&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b6025fd936a830bdd79a8d993319c27847d21ccfc2768a29f97ed93a47ecd424","category":"Tech"}
