Two weeks ago, BMW <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554419/bmw-i3-discontinued-us-electric-hatchback-sales\">confirmed</a> that this is the last month the company will be making its quirky and often misunderstood electric vehicle for US customers.

BMW pitched the i3 as the foundation of an entirely new line, and BMW could have seriously iterated on the design. There was talk in the early days of how easy it would be to simply drop a new carbon fiber reinforced plastic body onto the brilliantly engineered aluminum chassis, creating a suite of models that would explore a wide range of electrified mobility.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778799#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778799&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4db4392c1c07f1cc42ce3172e9be5d7a7695b8e884b9e9a8719c7521b089a8d","category":"Tech"}
