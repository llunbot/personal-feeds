But a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02563-1\">fresh analysis</a> published in the journal Nature Astronomy is casting that longstanding narrative in a more uncertain light. The authors conclude that the likelihood of this collision and merger is closer to the odds of a coin flip, with a roughly 50 percent probability that the two galaxies will avoid such an event during the next 10 billion years.</p>\n<p>Both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies (M31) are part of what's known as the Local Group (LG), which also hosts other smaller galaxies (some not yet discovered) as well as dark matter (per the prevailing standard cosmological model). Both already have remnants of past mergers and interactions with other galaxies, according to the authors.</p>\n<p>\"Predicting future mergers requires knowledge about the present coordinates, velocities, and masses of the systems partaking in the interaction,\" the authors wrote. That involves not just the gravitational force between them but also dynamical friction. It's the latter that dominates when galaxies are headed toward a merger, since it causes galactic orbits to decay.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/milky-way-galaxy-might-not-collide-with-andromeda-after-all/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/milky-way-galaxy-might-not-collide-with-andromeda-after-all/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bae66ca6588c7bfed5a688ab402743a469bf8bf0d7b02c1296ea9504fbe10034","category":"Tech"}
