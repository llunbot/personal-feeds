We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The problem child</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve had a week now to digest Apple’s latest pronouncements at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2361079/wwdc-2024-keynote-live-blog-ios-18-macos-15-watchos-11.html\">WWDC keynote</a>, and sometimes a little distance can be helpful. The febrile atmosphere of an Apple hype-fest can be fun, but it doesn’t exactly lend itself to a sense of perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days along, the impression remains that Apple had a <em>lot</em> to talk about, and has come up with some seriously substantial software updates for 2024. I have <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2364153/did-apple-just-sherlock-its-most-loyal-users.html\">mixed feelings</a> about the Gen AI elements of Apple Intelligence, but iOS 18 is undeniably a momentous release, blending long-requested customization options with big, risky innovations. macOS Sequoia, too, was able to back up the longer-term hopes of Apple Intelligence with a brilliantly appealing new feature (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2364295/macos-15-sequoia-iphone-mirroring-connecting-devices.html\">iPhone Mirroring</a>) and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365751/macos-sequoia-windows-tiling-dont-ditch-that-tiling-app.html\">tiled interface layout</a> that seems both nice-looking and convenient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about iPadOS 18? This seemed well short of a home run. Unlike the poor neglected Apple Watch, the iPad <em>does</em> get to be part of the cool Apple Intelligence crowd, but that’s not going to be here at all for a while and may not work well for longer still. The other OSes managed to offset this with more immediate benefits, but the iPad gets very little other than Calculator, an app it should have had more than a decade ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, the Math Notes feature is so good that Calculator for the iPad might just be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362395/ipados-18-calculator-math-notes-apple-pencil-handwriting-equations.html\">worth that ridiculous wait</a>. But a flash of brilliance like this just makes it all the more frustrating that Apple hasn’t elevated the iPad past what it was back in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the iPad a high-end creative tool? Is it a laptop replacement for business users, or a note-taker for people in hospitals and building sites? Or is it what it’s overwhelmingly used as right now, which is a low-end, instant-booting web surfer for users to mess around with on the couch while someone else watches Netflix on the big TV? Apple can try to hit all of these different markets by selling multiple hardware variations (albeit at the risk of making the buying decision <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2325523/ipad-pro-air-sizes-names-confusion.html\">intimidatingly complex</a>) but it will keep bumping up against the fundamental problem that the operating system isn’t suitable for more advanced applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple wants the iPad to replace the MacBook, it needs to bring iPadOS closer to macOS in scope and organizational structure. It’s not like the software department at Cupertino hasn’t tried: numerous multitasking features and modes have been added to iPadOS over the years. But we’re still at a point where doing two things at the same time is a lot more of a hassle on an iPad than it would be on a Mac, and as long as that’s the case, you can’t expect it to take off as a mainstream laptop replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, turning iPadOS into a sophisticated desktop-style OS will shrink the iPad’s appeal for its current userbase, by taking away the simple qualities that they value. And there’s no easy way to make both groups happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iPadOS gained less than the other big Apple platforms this year, but it needed more. Whereas customers know what the iPhone and Mac are for, the iPad is drifting around in commercial limbo, and something radical was needed to turn it around: not the needless addition of a ludicrously overpowered M4 chip, but a rethink of the software platform itself. And as exciting as WWDC 2024 was, it didn’t offer any real answers to the iPad question.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trending: Top stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <strong>iOS 18</strong> announcements leave us one thought: Steve Jobs would <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2367507/ios-18-customization-icons-colors-control-center-steve-jobs.html\">never have allowed this</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> is nice, but <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2364295/macos-15-sequoia-iphone-mirroring-connecting-devices.html\">Apple Laziness</a> is my jam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362925/macos-15-ipados-18-fealtures-math-notes-iphone-mirroring-walled-garden.html\">does its best work</a> inside its <strong>walled garden</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2367175/apple-intelligence-sherlock-search-product-feature.html\">Sherlock and Watson</a> all over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <strong>smartest new features</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362768/macalope-apple-intelligence-llm-chatgpt.html\">leave the Intelligence behind</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to <strong>iPhone customization</strong>, Apple is finally <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2364378/ios-18-customization-has-its-limits-wwdc.html\">letting you have it your way</a>–kinda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forget the harmless “Crush” ad.
