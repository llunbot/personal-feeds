Each pedal has a power sensor to provide instantaneous Angular Velocity (REAL) data instead of an average velocity. That’s because of the exclusive IAV Power system tech and an integrated gyroscope used for its data. The power meter pedals also incorporate the temperature and weather conditions when measuring watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedals connect via Bluetooth and ANT+ providing up to 50 hours of pedaling before recharging. These are Favero’s lightest and most compact pedal-based power meters, which are waterproof and shock-resistant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/favero-assioma-pro-mx-2-power-meter-pedals?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=080924_reader_survey_power\" target=\"_blank\">Favero Assioma PRO MX-2 Power Meter Pedals</a> are made for MTB and gravel rides and are SPD-compatible. They have integrated rechargeable batteries that last 60+ hours on a single charge and connect via Bluetooth or ANT+ to be compatible with most apps, watches, and cycling computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedal body is 6061-T6 aluminum so it’s both light and sturdy when you take on all kinds of trails. Like other pedals, these can be swapped to other bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you win a pair?
