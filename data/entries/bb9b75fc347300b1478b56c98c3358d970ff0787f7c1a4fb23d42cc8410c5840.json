The so-called ultimate burst pressure test was designed to measure the limits of the soft goods technology Sierra Space is developing alongside ILC Dover, which also built spacesuits for NASA.</p>\n<p>The 27-foot-diameter (8.2-meter) inflatable structure burst at 77 psi, exceeding NASA's recommended safety standard of 60.8 psi, which is four times the module's real-life operating pressure at 15.2 psi.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998174#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998174&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bb9b75fc347300b1478b56c98c3358d970ff0787f7c1a4fb23d42cc8410c5840","category":"Tech"}
