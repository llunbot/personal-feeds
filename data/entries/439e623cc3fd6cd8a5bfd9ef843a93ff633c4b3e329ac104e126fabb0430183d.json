Golovanova and colleagues’ super-technical archaeological terms, “a unique pointy bone artifact”) is the oldest bone tip from a hunting weapon ever found in Europe. It’s also evidence that Neanderthals figured out how to shape bone into smooth, aerodynamic projectiles on their own, without needing to copy those upstart <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Along with the bone tools, jewelry, and even rope that archaeologists have found at other Neanderthal sites, the projectile is one more clue pointing to the fact that Neanderthals were actually pretty sharp.</p>\n<h2><b>Getting to the point</b></h2>\n<p>Archaeologists found the bone point in Mezmaiskaya Cave, high in the Caucasus Mountains (Mezmaiskaya is also home to the remains of three Neanderthals who lived around 90,000 years ago; anthropologists sequenced samples of their DNA in earlier studies). Herbivore teeth from the same layer of sediment dated to around 70,000 years old, and the bone point’s position near the bottom of that layer probably makes it closer to 80,000 or 70,000 years old. That makes it the oldest bone projectile point ever found in Europe (so far).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/neanderthals-invented-their-own-bone-weapon-technology-by-80000-years-ago/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/neanderthals-invented-their-own-bone-weapon-technology-by-80000-years-ago/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
