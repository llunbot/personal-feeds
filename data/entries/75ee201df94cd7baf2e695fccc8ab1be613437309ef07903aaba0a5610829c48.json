Even after some minor drops, there are no scratches or scuffs to speak of.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere were reports of overheating early on with the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, but Apple has addressed this in software updates. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ stays cool to the touch for the most part, even when playing games. It can heat up when charging at random times, but it's not a consistent issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBattery life is about on par with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro Max battery life, and there doesn't seem to be much of an improvement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, Apple added an Action Button, and , well, it's not getting much use. It's hard to get in the habit of using a new button for things that we've done for years using other workflows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the camera, the best feature by far is the automatic portrait mode that lets you adjust focus after an image is captured without having to turn on Portrait mode. It's fun to use, and you can tap on each subject in the photo to change the focus from the foreground to the background. The 5x Telephoto lens is also a useful addition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMake sure to watch our full video for more thoughts on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, and let us know how it's performed for you over the last two months if you have one.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/iphone-15-pro-max-two-month-review/\">Review: Two Months With the iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-two-months-with-the-iphone-15-pro-max.2413103/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"75ee201df94cd7baf2e695fccc8ab1be613437309ef07903aaba0a5610829c48","category":"Apple"}
