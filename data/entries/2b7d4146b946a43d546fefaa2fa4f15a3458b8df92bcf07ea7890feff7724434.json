Last year, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the MagSafe Battery Pack <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">would be updated with a USB-C port</a> for charging in the foreseeable future, alongside the iPhone 15 series moving to USB-C. The current MagSafe Battery Pack has a Lightning port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the MagSafe Charger, one potential improvement could be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/25/iphone-15-expected-to-support-qi2/\">Qi2 support</a>, which could allow for up to 15W charging of non-Apple devices instead of the current 7.5W limit. The first Qi2-certified chargers are expected to launch later this year. It's unclear if the MagSafe Duo Charger with an Apple Watch charging puck would also be updated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released the MagSafe Battery Pack in 2021, while the MagSafe Charger has been available since 2020. The accessories have not been updated since then, but they have received several firmware updates with optimizations over the years. Last month, it was discovered that Apple prototyped the MagSafe Charger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-planned-magsafe-charger-color-options/\">in several different colors</a>, but it's unclear if the additional colors would ever be made available to the public.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>iOS 17 beta 1 has references to a new MagSafe Charger with the model number A3088 <a href=\"https://t.co/adXoNOZz8l\">pic.twitter.com/adXoNOZz8l</a></p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1665832404689334273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/ios-17-code-new-magsafe-battery-pack-charger/\">iOS 17 Beta Code References New MagSafe Battery Pack and Charger</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-beta-code-references-new-magsafe-battery-pack-and-charger.2392048/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2b7d4146b946a43d546fefaa2fa4f15a3458b8df92bcf07ea7890feff7724434","category":"Apple"}
