{"title":"iOS 17.5 beta 4 arrives a week before the May iPad event","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262753/ios-17-5-release-features-beta-how-to-install.html","date":1714671670000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a month since the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218208/ios-17-4-alternative-app-stores-emoji-fixes-security-updates-install.html\">release of iOS 17.4</a>, which introduced a few minor tweaks (like new emojis) for all users, but it has a massive change to app distribution for those in the European Union. In compliance with the Digital Markets Act, that version allowed alternate app stores, changed policies and terms around apps, browsers that use their own engines, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, a new iOS version is followed almost immediately by a beta of the next point release, so the month-long absence of any iOS beta is a strange occurrence. We expect the beta to continue for at least a few weeks; the final release of iOS 17.5 might not even come until May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update May 2:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-17-5-repair-state/&amp;xcust=1-1-2262753-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a> has found a new “repair state” function in iOS 17.5.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in iOS 17.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know everything that we can expect in iOS 17.5 as there are no patch notes yet, but we keep this section updated with significant new features and changes as they are discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Repair state:</strong> A new function that lets you set your iPhone into a “repair state” that allows it to be fixed without removing Activation Lock or removing your phone from Find My.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App downloads from websites (EU only):</strong> Another feature in compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act, iOS 17.5 enables users to download apps directly from websites. In order to offer these downloads, developers need to clear significant hurdles (including being a registered developer for two years and having existing apps with more than a million downloads in the prior year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unwanted item tracking:</strong> According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/02/ios-17-5-unwanted-tracking-accessories/&amp;xcust=1-1-2262753-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">9to5Mac</a>, the 17.5 beta includes references to a new anti-stalking feature that works with third-party trackers as well as AirTags. The new language in the Find My app reads: “This item isn’t certified on the Apple Find My network. You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Apple Pencil and squeeze gesture (iPadOS only):</strong> MacRumors has found code within the iPadOS 17.5 beta that references a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2286875/apple-pencil-3-squeeze-gesture-ipados-17-5-beta.html\">new “V4” Apple Pencil</a> and a potential new “squeeze” gesture for certain actions. A new Apple Pencil has been rumored to be on the way at the same time as a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a>, which may launch in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.5: How to install the public beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be among the first to install iOS 17.5, you can sign up for the public beta and get the release candidate now. The process for installing a beta has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click Sign Up on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://beta.apple.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2262753-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Beta page</a> and register with your Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in to the Beta Software Program.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Enroll your iOS device</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app, tap <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.5: How to install the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. Beginning with iOS 17, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958&amp;xcust=1-1-2262753-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting <em>iOS Public Beta</em> in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about iOS 17 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17 superguide</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"41e53688552e4fffc68ae4202bfe1c80f20a2fbc0d1bcbf257c4dfa017a02b60","category":"Apple"}
