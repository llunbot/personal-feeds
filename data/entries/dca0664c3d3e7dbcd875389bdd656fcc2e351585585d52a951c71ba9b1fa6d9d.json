The big-box retailer said it remains focused on its own convenient payment technologies available in the Walmart app, including Walmart Pay and Mobile Scan &amp; Go.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWalmart Pay allows customers to scan a QR code displayed at checkout to pay for their purchase with a payment card stored in the Walmart app. Scan &amp; Go allows Walmart+ members to save time by scanning barcodes on items while they shop, rather than having to scan all of the items at a self-checkout register later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe spokesperson said the following statement still stands:<blockquote>We do not accept NFC and instead have implemented convenient solutions, such as Walmart Pay, that provide our customers easy, touchless payments on any smartphone. We have also invested in innovative technologies that go beyond payments, such as Scan &amp; Go, which allow Sam's Club and Walmart+ members to bypass the checkout altogether, providing a truly touchless shopping experience.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Pay launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/17/apple-celebrates-10-years-of-apple-pay/\">more than 10 years ago</a>, and it was accepted at more than 90 percent of U.S. retailers as of 2022, according to Apple. Some other major Apple Pay holdouts in the U.S. have reversed course and started accepting it over the past few years, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/home-depot-and-heb-rolling-out-apple-pay/\">including The Home Depot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/lowes-apple-pay/\">Lowe's</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/15/kroger-fred-meyer-apple-pay/\">Kroger</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/home-depot-and-heb-rolling-out-apple-pay/\">Texas grocery store chain H-E-B</a>, leaving Walmart as one of the country's only major retailers not to accept Apple Pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWalmart has accepted Apple Pay in Canada since 2020.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/walmart/\">Walmart</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/walmart-reiterates-why-it-doesnt-accept-apple-pay/\">Walmart Stands Firm on Why It Doesn't Accept Apple Pay in the U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/walmart-stands-firm-on-why-it-doesnt-accept-apple-pay-in-the-u-s.2447966/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dca0664c3d3e7dbcd875389bdd656fcc2e351585585d52a951c71ba9b1fa6d9d","category":"Apple"}
