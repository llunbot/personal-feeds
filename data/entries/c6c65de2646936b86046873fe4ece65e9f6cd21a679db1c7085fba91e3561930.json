But Slack's policy may need updating \"to explain more carefully how these privacy principles play with Slack AI,\" Maurer wrote on Threads, partly because the policy \"was originally written about the search/recommendation work we've been doing for years prior to Slack AI.\"</p>\n<p>Maurer was responding to a Threads <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@gergelyorosz_/post/C7CtYPOIkPA\">post</a> from engineer and writer Gergely Orosz, who called for companies to opt out of data sharing until the policy is clarified, not by a blog, but in the actual policy language.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025179#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025179&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c6c65de2646936b86046873fe4ece65e9f6cd21a679db1c7085fba91e3561930","category":"Tech"}
