{"title":"Tour de France 2023: Which Smart Trainers Do They Use?","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/07/tour-de-france-2023-which-smart-trainers-do-they-use.html","date":1690030848000,"content":"<p></p>\n<p>In this video I dive into all the behind the scenes bits on time-trial day, including which smart trainers they use. However, realistically, it’s actually quite a bit more than that in this video. I look at an interesting new trend in how the warm-ups are done, as well as some of the crazy cooling gear athletes and teams use. Plus, what happens step-by-step from when a rider steps out of the team van and to their trainer, all the way up to the starting line.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, this is the first year we’ve seen a trainer in the technical zone that’s not from one of the big legacy trainer makers (Wahoo/Garmin-Tacx/Elite/Saris), so that was kinda fun to check out. Here’s the full listing of exactly what they’re riding, with all of these highlighted up in the full walk-through video above:</p>\n<p><strong>Elite Teams:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>AG2R Citroën Team: Elite Suito<br />\nArkéa–Samsic: Elite Suito<br />\nIsrael–Premier Tech: Elite Suito<br />\nCofidis: Elite Direto XR<br />\nGroupama–FDJ: Elite Justo<br />\nIntermarché–Circus–Wanty: Elitę Suito<br />\nMovistar Team: Elite Suito<br />\nTeam Bahrain Victorious: Elite Suito<br />\nTeam DSM–Firmenich: Elite Justo<br />\nTeam Jayco–AlUla: Elite Suito<br />\nUAE Team Emirates: Elite Justo</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tacx (Garmin) Teams:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Astana Qazaqstan Team: Tacx NEO 2T<br />\nIneos Grenadiers: Tacx NEO 2T<br />\nLotto–Dstny: Tacx NEO 2T<br />\nSoudal–Quick-Step: Tacx NEO 2T<br />\nTeam Jumbo–Visma: Tact NEO2T<br />\nTeam TotalEnergies: Tacx NEO 2T<br />\nUno-X Pro Cycling Team: Tacx NEO 2T</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wahoo Teams:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Bora–Hansgrohe: Wahoo KICKR V6<br />\nEF Education–EasyPost: Wahoo KICKR V5/V6<br />\nLidl–Trek: Wahoo KICKR V6 + Wahoo ROLLR</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Zwift Teams:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Alpecin–Deceuninck: Zwift Hubs</p></blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly and totally unrelated, this was one of the quietest years I’ve seen in the technical zone at a TdF time trial day. I’m not sure if it was because everyone was simply out on the course, or perhaps the location, or what. Ironically, it was BY FAR the most spectator-friendly technical zone setup for a TT stage I’ve seen in years. It varies by every single stage/day/town layout, and is often just a product of available land for all the team buses. But someone could have shot the same video as me from the sidelines without a media pass – a rarity most days. Still, there were very few people around. TV coverage does seem to indicate most were up on the course.</p>\n<p>In any case – enjoy the video!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"8d06f6e260ac1cc0a2964256a6e5168cae24ded3ca5c2ab55496f3f34bf4deb0","category":"Cycling"}
