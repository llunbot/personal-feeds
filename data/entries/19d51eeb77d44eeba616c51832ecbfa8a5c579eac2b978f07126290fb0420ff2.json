Since a refurbished Mac is a machine that a customer returned, all the Mac Pros in Apple’s refurbished inventory are ones that a customer designed. You can’t customize a refurb, so you basically have to pick what’s on the shelf. If you really want a refurb Mac Pro, you may have to settle for a model that doesn’t quite fit the specifications you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, big savings could be had. We’ve see model for sale that were over $1,000 cheaper than a brand new model. However, at the time of this writing, the cheapest Mac Pro available is nearly $18K. The models currently available are out of reach for most consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-1-0-0\">Go to the Apple Certified Refurbished store to see all of the available Mac Pros for sale.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refurbished Apple TV</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/apple-tv-100741667-small.jpg\" /></figure></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through periods of being unavailable, Apple has inventory of its Apple TV in stock.
