[credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.tagheuer.com/us/en/\">TAG Heuer</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>The unlikely combination of TAG Heuer and Nintendo has announced the \"<a href=\"https://www.tagheuer.com/us/en/smartwatches/tagheuer-connected-collaboration-3.html\">TAG Heuer Connected ✕ Super Mario Limited Edition</a>\" smartwatch. Like previous <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/and-you-thought-wear-os-was-dead-tag-heuer-launches-1800-smartwatch/\">TAG Heuer Connected</a> watches, this is an extremely expensive ($2,150) Wear OS smartwatch with extremely dated internals. You'll mostly be paying for the TAG Heuer and Nintendo name.</p>\n<p>TAG Heuer's website is still counting down the time to the July 15 release date, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/its-a-me-mario-smartwatch-by-tag-heuer-connected-060037257.html\">but</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/this-limited-edition-super-mario-smartwatch-will-run-you-2150/\">several</a> sites have already published the details of the watch. The specs match the 2020 TAG Heuer Connected, so that means a 45mm watch with a Snapdragon Wear 3100 SoC, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, a 1.39-inch, 454×454 OLED display, a 430 mAh battery, Wi-Fi, NFC, GPS, water resistance, and a heart-rate sensor. In terms of the computer hardware, you could get the same thing from a $300 Wear OS device.</p>\n<p>What you are getting is TAG Heuer design and materials, like a steel watch body and a superhard sapphire touchscreen. The hardware has a few <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/mario/\"><em>Mario</em></a>-specific touches, like a mushroom, warp pipe, and a star for the 3, 6, and 9-hour indicators on the bezel. The watch crown and clasp have engraved \"M\" logos, just like Mario's cap. There also seem to be two watchbands: one red rubber strap and another black leather strap with red highlights.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780157#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780157&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"37aeddba63979bc1b15dda0120b5c3e6994ad455940f080657c0eacb906e9377","category":"Tech"}
