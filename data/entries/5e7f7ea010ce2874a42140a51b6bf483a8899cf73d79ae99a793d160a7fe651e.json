While it’s still possible to spend thousands on a smart trainer, new entrants to the market and a flood of post-pandemic stock have also forced prices down in many cases.</p>\n<p>You can choose between wheel-on options, where your rear tyre provides the connection to the trainer or direct drive models, where you remove your rear wheel and attach your bike to a cassette on the trainer. Wheel-on trainers are in general more affordable, but direct-drive models provide a better experience and avoid wear on your bike’s tyres.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ve rounded up the best cheap turbo trainers and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a> Black Friday deals to help keep you riding this winter.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h2>Where to find the best early UK Black Friday cycling deals </h2>\n<p>These retailers typically offer Black Friday discounts on quality cycling equipment.</p>\n<h3>Black Friday cycling deals: UK quick links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://knl.mntzrlt.net/shop-rest/api/link/wrapper/608/12?mk=GBP_EN&amp;su=https%3A%2F%2Fpublishers.monetizer101.com%2Fhub%2Flink-generator%2Findex.html&amp;tu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fr-pm%2Fblackfriday\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction</a> – Offering up to 60 per cent off cycling gear including bikes, clothing, shoes and more</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://knl.mntzrlt.net/shop-rest/api/link/wrapper/608/12?mk=GBP_EN&amp;su=https%3A%2F%2Fpublishers.monetizer101.com%2Fhub%2Flink-generator%2Findex.html&amp;tu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.co.uk%2Fblack-friday\" target=\"_blank\">Wiggle</a> – Offering up to 60 per cent off a huge range of cycle gear</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sigma Sports</a> – Offering up to 60 per cent off top-notch cycling kit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More retailers to keep an eye on are…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.probikekit.co.uk/offers/black-friday.list\" target=\"_blank\">ProBikeKit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/browse/c0-deals/c1-black-friday/_/N-10mbq6r\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.halfords.com/black-friday/\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/search-keywords/xx_xx_xx_xx_xx/-price_deals-/xx-criteria.html\" target=\"_blank\">Currys</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Black Friday cycling deals: US quick links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jensonusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jenson USA</a> – Jenson is offering plenty of deals to those based in the US</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More retailers to keep an eye on are…</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.competitivecyclist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Competitive Cyclist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mikesbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike’s Bikes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.westernbikeworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Western Bike Works</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theproscloset.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pro’s Closet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<h2>Pinnacle HC Turbo Home Trainer – £700 £210 (save 70%)</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinnacle HC Turbo Home Trainer\" title=\"Pinnacle HC Turbo Home Trainer\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can get the Pinnacle HC trainer at a huge discount.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Pinnacle HC trainer is a UK-only option from Evans Cycles’ brand.</p>\n<p>It’s compatible with eight- to 12-speed drivetrains and you can buy an XDR freehub body if you run a SRAM drivetrain.</p>\n<p>It’s not without its issues, but will simulate a 20 per cent gradient and provide 2,500 watts resistance, so it’s up there with top trainers from the big brands while undercutting their prices.
