Hinton, who helped create some of the fundamental technology behind today's generative AI systems, fears that the tech industry's drive to develop AI products could result in dangerous consequences—from misinformation to job loss or even a threat to humanity.</p>\n<p>\"Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\" the Times quoted Hinton as saying. \"Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That’s scary.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hinton's résumé in artificial intelligence extends back to 1972, and his accomplishments have influenced current practices in generative AI. In 1987, Hinton, David Rumelhart, and Ronald J. Williams popularized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation\">backpropagation</a>, a key technique for training neural networks that is used in today's generative AI models. In 2012, Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, and Ilya Sutskever <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf\">created</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet\">AlexNet</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/04/17/how-a-toronto-professors-research-revolutionized-artificial-intelligence.html\">commonly hailed</a> as a breakthrough in machine vision and deep learning, and it arguably <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-generative-ai-revolution-has-begun-how-did-we-get-here/\">kickstarted</a> our current era of generative AI. In 2018, Hinton won the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award\">Turing Award</a>, which some call the \"Nobel Prize of Computing,\" along with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935563#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935563&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d151ee38771324b9207d762d8cb3e1cc6ff0690ed178e62701b27e2f6353c49a","category":"Tech"}
