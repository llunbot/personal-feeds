Sonos plans to offer the headphones in black and white, and features will include voice control navigation and synchronization with Sonos speakers, soundbars, and subwoofers. Sonos plans to price its over-ear headphones at $400 to $500, which is in line with the ‌AirPods Max‌ as well as over-ear headphones from companies like Sony and Bose.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s report suggests that Sonos isn't aiming to introduce a more technical feature set than Apple provides, with the company instead focusing on customization and fine-tuning sound with a \"Passport\" app. Sonos has been working on the headphones for several years, and they are set to be available as early as April 2024. In the future, the company may also develop a set of earbuds that would be similar to the AirPods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn late 2024 or 2025, Sonos will introduce a set-top streaming box akin to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>. The device will serve as a hub for Sonos audio equipment with support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and it will offer apps and streaming services much like existing set-top boxes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos is developing an Android-based operating system for the set-top box, expected to be priced somewhere between $150 and $200. Talks are being conducted with cable companies about possible live television offerings, and Sonos may even create its own video service.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos is developing new amplifiers and in-ceiling speakers for professional installers, a version of the Era 100 speakers for businesses, and a high-end TV sound bar that will be an update to the Arc. For consumers, Sonos is developing a new version of the Sub that will sync with the planned set-top box, along with an updated Roam speaker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence confirmed that Sonos is planning to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/sonos-new-product-category/\">enter a new product category</a> that will \"complement\" current Sonos devices and that will \"delight customers and drive immediate revenue.\" Sonos expects to generate more than $100 million from new products in 2024.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/\">Sonos</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/21/sonos-headphones-set-top-box/\">Sonos to Launch $400+ Headphones and Set-Top Box, Competing with Apple Devices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-to-launch-400-headphones-and-set-top-box-competing-with-apple-devices.2411635/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d6a99665aeb6b666235429d4fe59453f7adac07b2fd502516778f87a871dd82","category":"Apple"}
