Published on Tuesday morning, the social media post was 'hidden,' but somehow discovered late Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this is a credible date that the company is working toward. Following the fueling test on Sunday night at the company's Starbase site in South Texas, the hardware appears to be in good shape. Although SpaceX has yet to receive its launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency recently announced that it has closed its investigation into the second Starship test flight in November. So a mid-March launch date is plausible from a regulatory standpoint.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008182#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008182&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b696e3c2b8aae4854088060e9b00fd34064c8a0d574f448560c9dffe6e321227","category":"Tech"}
