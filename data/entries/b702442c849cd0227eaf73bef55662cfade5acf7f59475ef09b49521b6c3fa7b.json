Sign up for <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/\">Apple's public beta program</a> with your Apple ID, and you'll be able to select the public beta builds from Software Update in the Settings app.</p>\n<p>We covered the highlights of most of these releases when they were announced during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/\">more home screen customization</a> in iOS and iPadOS, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-announces-macos-15-sequoia/\">window tiling and iPhone mirroring in macOS,</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/apple-announces-rcs-support-for-imessage/\">RCS text messaging support</a> across all of Apple's platforms, and more. But Apple <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/three-betas-in-ios-18-testers-still-cant-try-out-apple-intelligence-features/\">still isn't ready</a> to show off a preview of its Apple Intelligence AI features, including the text and image generation features and a revamped Siri. Many of these features are still slated for \"later this summer\" and will presumably be available in some form in the final releases this fall.</p>\n<p>Most devices that can run iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS 14 Sonoma will be able to update to the new versions, including owners of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-case-for-and-against-macos-15-sequoia-being-the-final-release-for-intel-macs/\">the last couple generations of Intel Macs</a>. But <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/these-are-all-the-devices-compatible-with-ios-18-and-ipados-18/\">a handful of older phones and tablets</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/macos-15-sequoia-still-supports-intel-macs-but-cuts-the-2018-macbook-air/\">the 2018 MacBook Air</a> are being dropped by the new releases. The watchOS 11 update is also dropping the Series 4 and Series 5 models as well as the first-generation Apple Watch SE.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037128#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037128&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b702442c849cd0227eaf73bef55662cfade5acf7f59475ef09b49521b6c3fa7b","category":"Tech"}
