Now you just need to buy it.</p>\n<p>Bike finance offers a flexible way of paying for your bike in monthly instalments, rather than all in one go, and many bike retailers offer this online and in-store.

This is usually around 10 per cent of the total price of the bike.</p>\n<p>You can spread the cost of your repayments over the course of (in most cases) between three and 48 months.</p>\n<p>Zero per cent interest deals are often available on shorter-term agreements.</p>\n<p>Longer-term payment plans (usually upwards of 12 months) will mean lower monthly repayments, but they will usually have interest percentage rates added on top of the cost of the bike.</p>\n<p>A quick note on terminology. ‘Interest rate’ and ‘APR’ are two terms often used within bike finance agreements that look similar (both are expressed as a percentage rate) but are completely different beasts.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Interest rate</strong> refers to the flat charge on the amount of money loaned through your bike finance agreement</li>\n<li><strong>APR</strong> is calculated using a complex formula (prescribed by FCA rules) and takes into account other credit charges and fees alongside interest rates</li>\n</ul><p>For example, a credit agreement subject to a zero per cent rate of interest may not automatically have an APR of zero per cent, because there may be other fees or credit charges under the agreement.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h4>A word of warning</h4>\n<p>Please remember that applying for loan finance is noted on your personal credit rating, and missing or making late repayments will harm it and may make it harder to borrow in the future.</p>\n<p>Don’t borrow more than you can afford to repay; use <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/\">BikeRadar’s reviews</a> to help you find a great bike whatever your price limit.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><p> </p>\n<h2>Pros of financing a road or mountain bike</h2>\n<p>The advantage of finance is that it enables a customer to spread the cost of a purchase via a series of affordable payments, rather than spend a lump-sum upfront.</p>\n<p>Of course, regardless of whether you’re <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buying-a-bike/\">buying a bike</a> on finance or outright, you should never spend more than you can afford.<br /><a></a></p>\n<h2>Cons of financing a road or mountain bike</h2>\n<p>Unless your agreement is 0 per cent interest and 0 per cent APR, the downside of bike finance is that there will be interest and other charges to pay, meaning you may pay more over time than the original cost of the bike.</p>\n<p>Like any contract, once you’ve applied, have been accepted and signed the finance agreement, you will be obligated to make the agreed monthly repayments, so only apply if you know you will be able to do so.</p>\n<p>Late or non-payment will void any interest-free agreements. You will incur late payment interest and payment charges, and will end up paying more.</p>\n<p>In serious cases, you could be taken to court by the lender. It can also seriously harm your credit rating, which could affect future credit applications, including mortgage applications.</p>\n<p>So, again, we stress, don’t buy something that you’re unsure you can afford. Make sure you read the fine print of any agreement before signing to avoid any unexpected costs down the line.</p>\n<p>Also bear in mind that you won’t own the bike until you’ve paid off the balance of the loan. If you write off the bike or it’s stolen, you’ll still be eligible for the loan payments, so it’s a good idea to look for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-insurance-guide/\">bike insurance</a> to cover your shiny new bike.<br /><a></a></p>\n<h2>Bike financing through the Cycle to Work Scheme</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ribble Hybrid AL Leisure\" title=\"Ribble Hybrid AL Leisure\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cycle to Work scheme is a useful method to make a new bike affordable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rebecca Leach / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If your employer is participating in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycle-to-work-scheme-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Cycle to Work Scheme</a>, it’s possible to buy a new bike through it and save money by doing so.</p>\n<p>With this scheme, you effectively ‘rent’ a bike from your employer tax free, and then buy it off them at the end of the loan period. Savings of up to 42 per cent on a full-priced bike are possible.</p>\n<p>The main difference between this and financing elsewhere is that your repayments are taken directly out of your salary, so you will not pay tax or National Insurance on this sum.</p>\n<p>There used to be a blanket £1,000 cap on what could be bought through the scheme, but the Department for Transport updated its guidance in 2019 and now allows employers to save on cycle to work packages in excess of £1,000.</p>\n<p>It’s worth checking with your employer to see if there is a company cap in place.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Who is eligible for bike finance?</h2>\n<p>The specific terms may differ for each provider, but generally, to apply for bike finance in the UK you must:</p>\n<ul><li>Be at least 18 years or older</li>\n<li>Be a permanent UK resident</li>\n<li>Be either: in regular employment, either full-time (16+ hours a week) or self employed, retired and over 50 years old with a pension, or in receipt of a disability allowance</li>\n<li>Be able to make repayments by Direct Debit</li>\n<li>Provide your previous address if you have lived at your current address for less than three years</li>\n</ul><p>Under Financial Conduct Authority consumer credit rules, every applicant for finance will be subject to an affordability assessment, which will involve an ID and credit reference check for anti-money laundering purposes.</p>\n<p>If your application has been declined before, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t reapply. Be aware that repeated applications could severely harm your credit rating, however.</p>\n<p>It’s widely recognised that circumstances change and your ‘risk level’ will be considered based on the information in your newest application.<br /><a></a></p>\n<h2>How much can you borrow on bike finance?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2023 Scott Foil RC Pro\" title=\"2023 Scott Foil RC Pro\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> High-end superbikes are in the range of some finance offerings if you qualify.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Retailers acting as brokers give finance credit on purchases made costing upwards of £250.

There’s a new scheme to be launched in summer 2023, which will allow you to purchase a used ebike with a loan.<br /><a></a></p>\n<h2>Who offers bikes on finance?</h2>\n<p>Most major bike retailers provide the opportunity for you to purchase a bike on finance and act as credit brokers, rather than lenders.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely you will be borrowing money from the retailer itself. V12 Retail Finance is the UK’s only specialised retail finance provider via its Ride It Away product, and most online bike retailers provide bike finance credit through it.
