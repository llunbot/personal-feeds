Ramato is its unique copper colourway and a trademark feature.</p>\n<p>Wilier’s history dates to 1906 when its founder Pietro Dal Molin started building bikes in Bassano del Grappa, northern Italy. Commercial success soon followed and, after World War Two, he formed his own professional cycling team.</p>\n<p>In 1948, Italian cycling legend Fiorenzo Magni took the Tour of Flanders and Giro d’Italia on Wilier bikes. It was the start of an illustrious association with numerous cycling heroes, such as Marco Pantani and Alessandro Ballan, who rode to victory in the 2008 UCI Road World Championships.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wilier Triestina Mark Cavendish\" title=\"Wilier Triestina\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mark Cavendish was aboard a special Filante SLR during his last Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Continuing its racing heritage, since 2020 Wilier has supported the Astana Pro Team, which recently welcomed Mark Cavendish into the fold. Cavendish is riding the Filante SLR for his final season of racing.</p>\n<h2>The colour of success</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wilier's signature Ramato colourway.\" title=\"SuperRecordWireless WILIER-3_1024x768\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wilier’s signature Ramato colourway.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>Ramato was used widely between the 1940s and the 1980s, when steel bikes still ruled. The company even made Ramato a trademark in 1945 after it had become Wilier’s signature colour.</p>\n<p>In celebration of Wilier’s 110th birthday – and as a tip of the hat to its iconic race bikes – Wilier launched the Superleggera in Ramato in 2016.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wilier Cento10 Pro Ramato\" title=\"Wilier Cento10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Wilier Cento 10 Pro in a Romato finish.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>The following year, it brought the copper finish to the Cento10Pro, saying the bike provided a “direct connection between modern racing bicycles and the skilled craftsmen who brought the original Ramato bicycle to life”.</p>\n<p>The Filante SLR in Ramato is the latest in a first-class lineage of Wilier bikes that have sported this unique shade and is a fitting finish to this World Tour-level ride.</p>\n<h2>What’s your hue?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wilier Ramato advertorial images4\" title=\"Wilier Ramato advertorial images4\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wilier worked with Italian Road Cycling national team coach and ambassador Daniele Bennati to create this custom paintjob.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>Wilier is proud of its broad colour palette and there are various vibrant colourway options.
