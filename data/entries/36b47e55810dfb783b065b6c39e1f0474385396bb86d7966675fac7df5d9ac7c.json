That supple grippy rubber combines with a relatively thin 60tpi casing and the lower pressures from wider tire volume to deform over obstances for improved grip.

When applied to a real-world scenario, this means that a Peyote rider in a typical XC race scenario will gain ~0.75 km/hr. of average speed over the course of the race. These benefits are in addition to an 11% increase in grip (especially in wet), and durability of the new casing without impacting dependability.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Vittoria Peyote &amp; Mezcal XC – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vittoria-Peyote-and-Mezcal-XC-Race-updated-lightweight-wide-cross-country-racing-mountain-bike-tires_black-or-brown-sidewall.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vittoria-Peyote-and-Mezcal-XC-Race-updated-lightweight-wide-cross-country-racing-mountain-bike-tires_black-or-brown-sidewall-1536x1440.jpg\" alt=\"29x2.4&quot; Vittoria Peyote XC Race cross-country mountain bike tire, brown or black wall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vittoria-Peyote-and-Mezcal-XC-Race-updated-lightweight-wide-cross-country-racing-mountain-bike-tires_black-or-brown-sidewall-1536x1440.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vittoria-Peyote-and-Mezcal-XC-Race-updated-lightweight-wide-cross-country-racing-mountain-bike-tires_black-or-brown-sidewall-297x278.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vittoria-Peyote-and-Mezcal-XC-Race-updated-lightweight-wide-cross-country-racing-mountain-bike-tires_black-or-brown-sidewall-120x113.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vittoria-Peyote-and-Mezcal-XC-Race-updated-lightweight-wide-cross-country-racing-mountain-bike-tires_black-or-brown-sidewall-768x720.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Vittoria-Peyote-and-Mezcal-XC-Race-updated-lightweight-wide-cross-country-racing-mountain-bike-tires_black-or-brown-sidewall.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Vittoria)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-new Peyote and updated Mezcal cross-country tires are both offered in 2.25″ and 2.4″ sizes.
