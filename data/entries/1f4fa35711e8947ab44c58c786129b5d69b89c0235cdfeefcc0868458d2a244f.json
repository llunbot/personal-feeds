At first glance, it resembles its MagSafe predecessor, but there are small improvements in the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important feature: the Qi2 standard offers MagSafe compatibility with a 15-watt charging power. In addition to the MagSafe charging slot for the iPhone 12 and later, the charging station also has a charging slot for earphones such as the AirPods Pro 2, as well as a charging slot for all Apple Watch models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The special feature of the Apple Watch charging station is that it comes in the form of a USB-C dongle. This makes it easy to remove and take with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stand’s design is slim, which makes it easier to place on a nightstand or desk. Available in white or black, the stand has a pleasing appearance. The weight of 348 grams sufficiently makes the stand feel solid and its four rubber feet are important as they provide reliable protection against slipping and scratches. ESR specifies a magnetic holding force of 1,000 grams. We have not measured this, but we can attest that the ESR charging station has a very good hold.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"ESR 3-in-1 Qi2 Ladeset für Watch\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ESR_3in1Ladeset_05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"ESR 3-in-1 Qi2 Ladeset für Watch\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ESR_3in1Ladeset_04.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"ESR 3-in-1 Qi2 Ladeset für Watch\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ESR_3in1Ladeset_03.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"ESR 3-in-1 Qi2 Ladeset für Watch\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ESR_3in1Ladeset_06.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The certification by the Qi2 standard and that of Apple for the Apple Watch charging dongle should guarantee maximum compatibility and speed. We measured the charging speed for the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch 7 after several rounds at 34 percent and 43 percent, respectively, after 30 minutes of charging. It was noticeable that the charging times for the Apple Watch varied between 32 and 52 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See our reviews and tests of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MagSafe chargers</a> for more options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ESR has positioned its latest charging station in the lower-price market without compromising on the basic features of fast charging and compatibility. To realize the low price, the active cooling of the more expensive models has been omitted. As a result, the charging performance is somewhat lower, but still in the top class.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the ESR 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there is a lot to like about the ESR 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set. It can charge the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time, and it has a solid and sturdy design. The Apple Watch charging is compromised, but having a removable watch charger is handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on </em><a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2365612/esr-3-in-1-qi2-ladeset-fur-apple-watch-test.html\"><em>Macwelt</em></a><em> and was translated by </em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\"><em>Roman Loyola</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1f4fa35711e8947ab44c58c786129b5d69b89c0235cdfeefcc0868458d2a244f","category":"Apple"}
