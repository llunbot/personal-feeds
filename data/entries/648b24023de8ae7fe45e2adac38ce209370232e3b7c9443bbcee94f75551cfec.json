The inserts are set at angles, so swapping them also adjusts the geometry to suit the intended application, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2.jpg\" alt=\"riders hanging out on the 2024 polygon tambora road gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>All photos c.

Switch to gravel mode and you have a 71.8º head angle, 280mm BB height, and 1045mm wheelbase. Chainstay length grows by 10mm across all frame sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tambora is Polygon’s first carbon fiber gravel bike, and it gets most of the accessory mounts of their sleek alloy Bend model. This means four bottle cage mounts, frame bag mounts, and rear fender mounts. It lacks the top tube bag and fork mounts, but it’s aimed more at racers than adventurers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3.jpg\" alt=\"gravel bike riders on a hazy mountain road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-polygon-tambora-road-and-gravel-bike-in-one-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All bikes ship in gravel setup with Vee Rail 700×40 tires, Selle Italia saddles, and carbon fiber forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024 Polygon Tambora models &amp;
