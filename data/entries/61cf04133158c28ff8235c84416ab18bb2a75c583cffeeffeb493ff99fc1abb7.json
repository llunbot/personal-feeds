He has been pursuing this vision since at least 2010,\nwhen he founded Niantic as an internal startup at Google, then\nspun it out and launched <em>Go</em>. The game, in which players wander\nthe streets with phones held to their faces trying to capture\nWeedles, Squirtles, and Nidorinas, was both a cultural phenomenon\nand a financial success, reaping over a billion dollars in\nrevenue. Like Wendy sewing Peter Pan’s shadow to his foot, Hanke\nhas been gradually binding the ephemeral to the real, providing a\nsubstrate for the merger of pixels and atoms that he sees as the\nfuture. [...]</p>\n\n<p>He’s read all the science fiction books and seen all the films\nthat first imagined the metaverse — all great fun, and all\n<em>wrong</em>. He believes that his vision, unlike virtual reality, will\nmake the real world better without encouraging people to totally\ncheck out of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Terrific interview.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/12/levy-hanke-interview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"61cf04133158c28ff8235c84416ab18bb2a75c583cffeeffeb493ff99fc1abb7","category":"Tech"}
