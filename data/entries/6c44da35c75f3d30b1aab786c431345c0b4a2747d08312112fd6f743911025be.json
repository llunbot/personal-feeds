The problem was caused by a stuck pressurization valve. Instead, the company has turned the launch attempt into a wet dress fueling test.</p>\n<p>The company has backup opportunities to launch on Tuesday and Wednesday, but since so much liquid oxygen and methane propellant was loaded on board the vehicle, it will take a minimum of 48 hours to recycle into a new countdown.</p>\n<p><strong>7:15 am ET update</strong>: The first rays of sunlight are visible in the sky over South Padre Island this morning, with a crescent Moon in the sky and the massive Starship rocket on the horizon. As of this writing, SpaceX engineers are still working toward the opening of the launch window at 9 am ET (8 am local time, 1300 UTC).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932092#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932092&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c44da35c75f3d30b1aab786c431345c0b4a2747d08312112fd6f743911025be","category":"Tech"}
