{"title":"Thoughts on the M4 iMac, and making peace with the death of the 27-inch model","link":"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/thoughts-on-the-m4-imac-and-making-peace-with-the-death-of-the-27-inch-model/","date":1730988046000,"content":"<p>The M4 iMac is a nice computer.</p>\n<p>Apple's addition of 16GB RAM to the basic $1,299 model makes it a whole lot more appealing for the vast majority of people who just want to take the computer out of the box and plunk it on a desk and be done. New USB-C accessories eliminate some of the last few Lightning ports still skulking around in Apple's lineup. The color options continue to be eye-catching in a way that evokes the original multicolored plastic ones without departing too far from the modern aluminum-and-glass Apple aesthetic. The $200 nano-texture display option, included in the review loaner that Apple sent us, is lovely, though I lightly resent having to pay more for a matte screen.</p>\n<figure>\n      <img width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-640x427.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-980x653.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2401-1440x960.jpeg 1440w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      The back of the iMac, where the color is the most visible.\n\n              <span>\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  </span>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n      <figure>\n      <img width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-640x360.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-2048x1152.jpeg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-384x216.jpeg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-1152x648.jpeg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-980x551.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2382-1440x810.jpeg 1440w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      New USB-C accessories.

The M4 isn't record-setting fast, but it is quick enough for the kinds of browsing and emailing and office stuff that most people will want to use it forâ€”the fully enabled 10-core version is usually around as fast as a recent Intel Core i5/Core Ultra 5 or an AMD Ryzen 5 desktop CPU, though using just a fraction of the power, and with a respectable integrated GPU that's faster than anything Intel or AMD is shipping in that department.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/thoughts-on-the-m4-imac-and-making-peace-with-the-death-of-the-27-inch-model/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/thoughts-on-the-m4-imac-and-making-peace-with-the-death-of-the-27-inch-model/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb6dc72fd204d52230a1d4d555dcb1182e099706f7587c95d3f7c4b2e6e88a03","category":"Tech"}
