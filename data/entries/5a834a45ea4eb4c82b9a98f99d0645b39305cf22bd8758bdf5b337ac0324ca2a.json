Instead, the brand has been focusing on soft goods, riding gear, and outwear. In 2025 however, it seems the dam has broken. Seeing the premium cycling clothing company release three bag designs (so far). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest is a super minimalist, super light (154g), race-focused hydration pack. This season, it will be on the top list for many gravel, mountain bike, and adventure racers. We took it for a shake-out earlier this month, and it’s nearly all it’s cracked up to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack full unit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-unit--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Velocio Hydration Pack – What is it? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Velocio released a commuter/travel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/accessories/products/riding-pack?variant=41792445120585\">Riding Pack</a> and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://velocio.cc/collections/accessories/products/riding-duffel?variant=41792445055049\">Riding Duffel</a>, breaking the seal on bag production. The riding pack and duffle are more lifestyle pieces rather than actual riding gear. They are both well crafted with the same attention to detail we’ve come to expect from Velocio, but they are not “on the bike” gear. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack @chaseincolor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-@chaseincolor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo (c) 2024 Taylor Chase\nwww.chaseincolor.com\n@chaseincolor\n\nVelocio Shoot 2024\nSan Luis Obispo, CA\nDecember 18, 2024</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hydration pack, however, is purely on-the-bike-focused. The newly minted design looks and feels more like a trail running pack than a piece of cycling kit. The construction is minimalist, with very thin, airy fabric choices to keep airflow and lessen the “rider’s pack feel.” The pack is feather-weight, at 154g for the bag only (no bladder), but only 313g in total with everything included (except water).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why a Hydration Pack?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocios’ roster of athletes is growing and growing, especially in the gravel and ultra-distance world. Recently, Velocio signed the heavy-hitting <a href=\"https://velocio.cc/pages/htsqd-2025\">htSQD</a> consisting of Keegan Swenson, Alexis Skarda, Tobin Ortenblad, and Ruth Holcomb. This group of hitters is laser-focused on the Lifetime Grand Prix and other off-road racing years. They needed a slim, lightweight, race-focused hydration pack, and Velicio delivered. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’m super picky with hydration packs and have tried what feels like all of them, and this is the best I’ve used. The fabric allows it to be light and ventilated compared to other packs but avoids bouncing and movement that typically comes with light and well-ventilated packs. The cargo is awesome too. It fits a 2L bladder and still has room for extra snacks or a light jacket in the main pack, but the external pockets are super well organized too. It makes it easy to stow wrappers on the go without fear of falling out.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keegan Swenson</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack mesh\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-mesh--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Designed to Disappear</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocio says the new hydration pack is “designed to disappear.”  That’s a tall task, considering the 1.5-2L of water that the pack holds. But it’s about weight distribution and placement, and after wearing it for a few weeks, we tend to think they got it right. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo (c) 2024 Taylor Chase\nwww.chaseincolor.com\n@chaseincolor\n\nVelocio Shoot 2024\nSan Luis Obispo, CA\nDecember 18, 2024</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Velocio Hydration Pack sits high on the mid-back. This purposeful design allows riders to easily get in and out of their jersey pockets and has less overall covered area on their back.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack back of pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back-of-pack-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vest Like Construction</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The construction is very sturdy but also consists of some very technical fabric. The fabric is mostly super thin, lightweight, and with a high elastane component. This helps the pack achieve its “not there” feeling while keeping airflow high. The only drawback that I see is longevity, but let’s talk about that in the ride impressions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack with gel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-gel--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pockets For Your Stuff</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The zippers are all YKK and very easy to access. There are three zippered compartments on the Velocio Hydration Pack. Two are on each side of the front, paired with an open jersey-like pocket, and one is more prominent on the back for tools, etc. The pockets on the front of the pack are effortless to access, and the pocket is generous enough that whatever it’s holding stays in place and doesn’t shoot out when the zipper is open. The zippers have a simple string pull tab that is easy to use with gloves on and glides easily. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-straps--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-straps--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack straps\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-straps--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-straps--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-straps--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-straps--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-straps--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-out-gel--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-out-gel--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack with out gel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-out-gel--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-out-gel--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-out-gel--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-out-gel--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-out-gel--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The zipperless pockets are nice, and the construction is more like a jersey pocket than a pack style. They are thin, with a small reflective piece on the lip, and curve away from the body. The super thin fabric (so much that it’s see-through) lets you stuff the pockets with gels and food. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-back--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Velocio Hydration Pack Key Features: </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It comes with a 1.5L HydraPak reservoir and magnetic hose clasp </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Second-skin fit moves with the body and is nearly weightless</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The minimal design sits above jersey pockets for easy access</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Size-specific construction eliminates unnecessary clasps and straps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ultralight stretch-woven fabric back pocket is expandable while holding cargo close and secure</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two front YKK zippered pockets keep essentials at hand while riding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Double chest straps adjust to fine-tune fit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Space for a 2L bladder (arrives with 1.5L), plus tools, gels, and a tube</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sizes:</strong> <strong>S/M (</strong>36.25-40″) <strong>M/L (</strong>40-44.5″) chest size </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $179</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 154g (pack only) 313g (total)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack full pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-full-pack--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon reading about Velocio signing the htSQD and releasing lifestyle packs, we knew something like a hydration pack was coming. I’m a big fan of the hydration pack for training during the winter in Pittsburgh. They are an easy way to keep your water unfrozen (if you put them on under your jacket) and not eat too much salt. That said, I usually ditch them during the spring for water bottles and only break it out for long mountain bike, or gravel races. I also gravitate towards race-focused super minimal designs like the EVOC Hydro Pro 1.5L or the USWE packs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Packbladder-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Packbladder-weight--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack bladder weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Packbladder-weight--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Packbladder-weight--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Packbladder-weight--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Packbladder-weight--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Packbladder-weight--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-pack-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-pack-weight--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack pack weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-pack-weight--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-pack-weight--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-pack-weight--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-pack-weight--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-pack-weight--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Velocio Hydration Pack nestles right in the mix with the front of the pack (zing!) but could also take the pole position. The special sauce is the pack’s minimal design, shoulder, strap cut, and jersey-like fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-inside--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sizing and Fit </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Velocio Hydration pack comes in two sizes, S/M and M/L. I opted for the S/M (I usually wear a small or medium jersey), which fits me well. The strappings on the chest are easy to dial in for size and placement. There are more robust elastic straps on the lower sides of the pack, but there is nothing to adjust the shoulders. I thought I would miss this feature but never thought about it. The fit is like a vest, less like a pack, and it feels excellent on the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack internal pocket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-internal-pocket--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>On the Pack Storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The storage is minimal. It’s not a multiday-stage race pack unless you have other ways to carry gear. The side gel and storage pockets are more than enough for easy grab-and-go races. Plus, the way the pack fits, riders have more access to their jersey pockets than any other pack I’ve used. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack bladder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-bladder--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Material-wise, the super thin fabric could tear over time, and I wonder about the elastane after being beaten by UV rays and caustic sweat. But, this is a race, minimal pack, and those are the ways of gains. I haven’t taken any falls with the pack on (thankfully), but I wonder about the material’s abrasion-resistant materials. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack with hose\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-with-hose--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>On the Bike Impressions </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the bike, the Velocio Hydration pack disappears. The overall comfort is excellent, and the fit is very nice. The “pads” should be super minimal and don’t offer support but stability. The trim is made from a four-way stretch fabric and helps cradle the pack on the rider’s back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ONLY piece that makes me wonder about long, HOT summer races is the color choice. Yes, we all know, “there is no new black.”  But I can’t help but think about the sun beating down on me on a gravel road, and I have this black pack on, just like an ant under a magnifying glass… but we don’t get that much sun in the winter in Pittsburgh, so look for that under my full review. I want a colorway in the same tan/sand color as the new Velocio bags. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocio Hydration Pack see through\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Velocio-Hydration-Pack-see-through--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How About Drinking? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The bladder and hose are from Hydrapak, with some cool Velocio customizations. They are easy to use, clean, and drink from. The magnetic clip is also easy to dial in for what you need on the bike. The standard hose length is long, and for those looking to get every bit of position dialed on their gravel bike, I recommend trimming the hose for less fuss while in the drops or tucked in. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lasting Impressions </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the Velocio Hydration pack is my new go-to for training and racing. The design is minimal, and I love that. It’s super easy to clean, just like a piece of cycling kit (no heat in the washer, no dryer). The material is high quality, and the cost isn’t outlandish. Velocio has a winner here.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://velocio.cc/products/hydration-pack?variant=41792444923977\">Velocio.cc</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/velocio-hydration-pack-super-minimal-race-focused-design/\">Velocio Enters Hydration Pack World With Super Minimal Race-Focused Design </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5a834a45ea4eb4c82b9a98f99d0645b39305cf22bd8758bdf5b337ac0324ca2a","category":"Cycling"}
