If you do, you'll upload a valid, unexpired prescription from a U.S. eye‑care professional after checkout.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213226\">add and store your vision prescription in the Health app</a> on the iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing pre-orders, the Vision Pro will launch in the U.S. on Friday, February 2. Starting at 8 a.m. local time that day, customers are invited to sign up for a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-demos-february-2/\">demo of the headset</a> at their local Apple Store, with slots to be available through the weekend on a first-come, first-served basis, according to Apple's email.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro starts at $3,499 in the U.S. with 256GB of storage.
