But the most recent operating system update (version 5.13.7) is rolling out now, and it refreshes the device's user interface for the first time since 2016 or so. AmazonÂ <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=23599449011\">says</a> that redesigns for the Home and Library screens, which are mostly untouched in the current Kindle update, will be coming \"later this year.\"</p>\n<p>The software update that enables the new interface began rolling out in August, but because Kindles only install updates automatically when they're charging and connected to Wi-Fi, it will be a few weeks or months before all supported Kindles will have a chance to grab the update (mine only installed it over this past weekend). To help you navigate the changes, the gallery above gives a brief tour of everything that has changed.</p>\n\n<p>The new update is available on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW\">most Kindles released in or after 2015</a>, including the 7th- and 10th-generation Kindle Paperwhite, the 8th-, 9th-, and 10th-generation Kindle Oasis, and the 8th- and 10th-generation standard Kindle. Older \"7th-generation\" Kindle devices like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/10/review-amazons-kindle-voyage-e-reader-is-the-king-of-its-niche/\">2014's Kindle Voyage</a> don't appear to be supported. If your Kindle hasn't installed the update, the link above will give you instructions for installing it manually.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794020#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794020&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ecf5ff78563e9cc22da046a5f0ee9cc973b6529420919be33a345ca21645aa0f","category":"Tech"}
