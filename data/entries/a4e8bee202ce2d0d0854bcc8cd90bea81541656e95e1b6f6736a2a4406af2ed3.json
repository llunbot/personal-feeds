{"title":"Bosch Launches New CX-R Motor, CX Motor Gets More Power & Torque w/ App Update","link":"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-performance-line-cx-r-motor-cx-motors-power-torque-app-update/","date":1748964513000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-CX-R-motor.webp\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" alt=\"(photo/Bosch)\" /></p>\n<p>The e-bike motor power wars are heating up, whether we like it or not. While most full-power e-MTB motors have been somewhat comparable in terms of power and torque for the past few years, some of the most recent models are kicking things up a notch. The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dji-avinox-105nm-ebike-motor-evolves-drone-tech-into-mega-power-at-2-5kg-lightweight/\">DJI Avinox</a> is a great example with its peak power of 850W and up to 105 Nm of torque. More recently, Specialized debuted its new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-specialized-levo-4-emtb-boast-up-to-111nm-of-super-power-control-genie-adjustability/\">S-Works 3.1</a> motor on the Turbo Levo 4, which boasts 720W of power and up to 111 Nm of hill-flattening torque (the standard 3.1 motor drops to 666 W and 101 Nm).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be outdone, Bosch recently announced the launch of an updated Performance Line CX-R motor. With a peak power of 750W and maximum torque of 100 Nm, it’s Bosch’s most powerful eMTB motor yet. Perhaps even more interesting, however, is that starting in July, users can increase the power and torque of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/boschs-new-performance-cx-ebike-motor-is-not-more-powerful-but-is-better-and-lighter/\">latest Performance Line CX motors</a> to match with a free over-air update through the eBike Flow app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Performance Line CX-R Motor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884.webp\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884.webp\" alt=\"The Kiox 400C display on A bike equipped with the CX-R motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5pb28084884-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Race mode is exclusive to the new Performance Line CX-R motor. (photo/Bosch)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new CX-R motor is the brand’s top-of-the-line model, stepping above the standard CX motor with its stock power, exclusive Race mode, and a lighter weight. The CX-R motor comes standard with a maximum power of 750W, maximum torque of 100 Nm, and assistance up to 400% of pedaling input.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch claims the CX-R motor’s Race mode “enables lag-free accelerations and assist with full power up to maximum speed.” This includes an Extended Boost, giving riders a little extra power when they need it most. The new eMTB+ mode is intended to be dynamic and progressive, adapting power output in relation to rider input. Of course, those modes and Tour+ and eMTB can be tuned to your exact preferences through the easy-to-use eBike Flow app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using premium materials like a titanium crank spindle, magnesium housing, and ceramic bearings, the CX-R motor clocks in at just under 6 pounds or 2.7 kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance Line CX Upgrade</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Cory riding up a steep trail on the Merida eOne-Eighty eBike with a Bosch CX motor.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Merida eOne-Eighty could potentially get the CX motor upgrade.

With current power at 600W and a max torque of 85 Nm, the increase to 750W and 100 Nm is pretty significant, and you don’t need to buy a new bike to get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, riders don’t have to update their motor if they’re already satisfied with its performance and range. And those who do update their CX motor have the ability to adjust the maximum power and torque through the eBike Flow app. Bear in mind that a more powerful motor will burn through the battery more quickly. It is also worth mentioning that Bosch states this update is subject to manufacturer approval, and that the brands will “set the maximum values within which users can adjust their performance values.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance Line CX update also includes the new eMTB+ mode for “dynamic control.” According to Bosch, “While eMTB mode in the basic setting is optimized for touring and a longer range, eMTB+ mode scores points for performance and trail fun.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Bosch Kiox 400C Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display.webp\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display.webp\" alt=\"The new Kiox 400C display screen with a plug in the USB-C charging port.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bosch-Kiox-400C-display-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The new Kiox 400C display looks like a huge upgrade over Bosch’s previous top tube integrated units. (photo/Bosch)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikes sold with new Performance Line CX and CX-R motors will also include the latest Kiox 400C display. This top-tube integrated screen shows all of your ride data at a glance while reducing handlebar clutter and protecting it from damage. Everything can be customized through integration with the eBike Flow app or the tactile buttons on the display itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch claims the new display is razor-sharp, glare-free, and auto-adjusts brightness based on light conditions. It also includes a USB-C charging port so you can keep your gadgets topped off on the trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch also updated its ABS software for the eBike ABS and eBike ABS Pro systems to regulate brake pressure more precisely. Additionally, M+ with eShift will be available in the fall in combination with the TRP E.A.S.I A12 drivetrain. This auto-shift feature will only work with this specific TRP drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When Can I Get it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch states that the first bikes with the new Performance Line CX-R motors are expected to be available in the fall of 2025. The over-air update, however, is expected in July, so eager owners of bikes with the latest Performance Line CX motors don’t have to wait that long for their power boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.bosch-ebike.com/\">bosch-ebike.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-performance-line-cx-r-motor-cx-motors-power-torque-app-update/\">Bosch Launches New CX-R Motor, CX Motor Gets More Power &amp; Torque w/ App Update</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a4e8bee202ce2d0d0854bcc8cd90bea81541656e95e1b6f6736a2a4406af2ed3","category":"Cycling"}
