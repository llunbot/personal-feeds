However, a new report claims Apple hasn’t given up on the idea of a bigger iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his latest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495\">Power On newsletter</a>, Mark Gurman claims that a large-screen iMac “remains something Apple is exploring.” He adds that it’s “unclear” whether the model will have an M4 chip or “something that comes the following year or later.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it’s a possibility, however distant, that Apple will launch a larger iMac this year. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Previous rumors</a> have said the new model could have a screen as large as 32 inches with Pro and Max processors, . It’s likely to be a model similar to the iMac Pro, with a high-end price and specs and MacBook Pro-inspired color options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December following the launch of the M3 iMac, Apple sent out a note to reviewers to say that it is not planning to release a new 27-inch iMac. However, that’s not to say a larger model is in the works to target a different type of user. When Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac in 2022, it coincided with the launch of the 27-inch Studio Display and Mac Studio, so any large-screen iMac would be larger than this anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re expecting Apple to launch the first M4 Macs this fall, so we should know very soon if Apple is launching a new larger iMac. In the meantime, you can keep up to date with the rumors of the32-inch iMac and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2423527/m4-imac-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">24-inch iMac update</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a8d36779c8f4eb1227175b72b609999c15561e2ab5708a7aaf90c5fba73c6da8","category":"Apple"}
