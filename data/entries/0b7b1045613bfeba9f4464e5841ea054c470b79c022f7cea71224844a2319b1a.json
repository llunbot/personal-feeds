The frame’s seatstay to rocker link pivots are hidden thanks to seatstay overlap, but each of the pivot bolts is easy to access for removal and tightening.</p>\n<p>Its brake, dropper post and gear cables are routed internally through the frame with partial internal guides, allowing the cables – where required – to cross over inside the bike’s tubing.</p>\n<p>This means it’s possible to set the brakes up moto (front brake on the right) or normal (front brake on the left), with cables exiting on the correct side of the frame to reduce unsightly bends near the head tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The cable ports have options for different routing choices.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Devinci</i></span></div>\n<p>The frame has a BSA73 threaded <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> and uses the larger 34.9mm seat-tube diameter, both done to improve the longevity of components and make maintenance easier.</p>\n<p>It has <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger</a> (UDH), and ISCG05 chain guide tabs.

This can be the cause of increased drivetrain drag, wear and noise.</p>\n<p>Devinci has done its best to reduce any potential problems and has extensively researched and tested idler pulley wheels, collaborating with drivetrain manufacturers to design the best performing and longest wearing wheel.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The newest Spartan HP is a good looking bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Devinci</i></span></div>\n<p>The most durable solution Devinci found was to use a steel idler pulley with a special surface coating to help reduce corrosion and increase its lifespan.</p>\n<p>It claims the Spartan HP’s idler wheel will need to be replaced the third time you replace your front chainring.</p>\n<p>Devinci also extensively tested how much power the idler wheel design loses compared to a normal drivetrain.</p>\n<p>The results revealed that measurable losses were within the test’s margin of error. So the potential losses weren’t significant enough to definitively say whether the high-pivot system increased drag.</p>\n<p>The ilder wheel runs on low-friction bearings and, in a bid to further reduce drag, the bearings’ design is closer to bottom bracket bearings than suspension pivot bearings</p>\n<p>Unlike some high-pivot suspension designs that require longer than standard chains, the Spartan HP is compatible with 126-link versions. Devinci says you would need to remove one or two links depending on the derailleur, cassette and chainring fitted. This means a consumer won’t need to buy two chains for the bike to work.</p>\n<h3>Delving deeper into the suspension</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear suspension is compatible with both air and coil sprung rear shocks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Devinci</i></span></div>\n<p>Devinci says the Spartan is compatible with coil and air shocks, hinting that its inherent kinematics are fairly progressive because coil springs are linear in nature, and without the natural ramp-up, they could bottom-out too easily.</p>\n<p>However, the brand keeps the bike’s suspension details and figures – such as anti-squat, anti-rise, progression and leverage rates – under wraps, but there are some interesting aspects to consider.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the Split Pivot design is well-known to be active under braking. This is usually thanks to lower anti-rise, where the suspension is tuned to extend slightly under braking.</p>\n<p>This propensity to extend should make it feel more active when a rider is braking compared to a bike that has more anti-rise.</p>\n<p>Bikes with high amounts of anti-rise, where the bike’s suspension wants to compress under braking forces, can have the feeling of the suspension locking up on the brakes.</p>\n<p>Although many dislike the sensation created by high levels of anti-rise, quite a few riders do appreciate how it can make the bike squat into its travel. This can reduce the feeling of forward weight transfer when braking, helping to stabilise the bike’s dynamic geometry.</p>\n<p>Single high-pivot bikes are known to have high amounts of anti-rise compared to low-pivot counterparts.</p>\n<p>In theory, by combining the Split Pivot and high-pivot designs, Devinci could well have mitigated against some of the often-criticised effects of a high-pivot design by potentially allowing the suspension to remain active under braking, while the bike’s dynamic geometry remains fairly stable.</p>\n<h2>2022 Devinci Spartan HP geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With high and low geometry settings, the Spartan HP is adjustable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Devinci</i></span></div>\n<p>Compared to the outgoing Spartan, the 2022 Spartan HP has been given the longer, lower and slacker treatment.</p>\n<p>The range features four sizes from small to extra-large, and each of the bike’s sizes has a low and high position, afforded by a flip-chip in the lower shock mount.</p>\n<p>The bike’s chainstay lengths are also size-specific, with the small and medium sizes getting shorter 425mm/421mm (low/high) lengths, while the extra-large has 435mm/431mm (low/high) chainstays.</p>\n<p>These figures appear short on paper but are given with the suspension fully extended.
