The electric powertrain specialists at Rimac have taken the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/rimac-nevera-first-drive-an-entirely-new-level-of-hypercar-performance/\">Nevera hypercar</a> to a test track in Germany where it set 23 new performance records. Among these, a 0-60 mph time of a mere 1.74 seconds and a standing quarter-mile in just 8.26 seconds. That means the Nevera can even outrun <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/tesla-takes-aim-at-upstarts-with-390-mile-range-200-mph-model-s-plaid/\">the mighty Model S Plaid</a>, which needs a second more to run the length of a drag strip.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most impressive record is one that few cars, electric or otherwise, are even capable of. It's the 0–400–0 time—hit 400 km/h (249 mph) from a standing start, then brake down to 0 mph. In 2017, Bugatti set the standard when the Chiron completed this test in 42 seconds.</p>\n<p>But that record was snatched away by Koenigsegg, the innovative Swedish hypercar manufacturer, first with an Agera RS with a time of 36.44 seconds, then again to 33.29 seconds, <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/news/sports-cars/a2151056/watch-koenigsegg-regera-break-0-400-0-record-kmh/\">then later to 31.49 seconds</a> using a Regera hypercar. Now Rimac has broken the 30-second barrier, completing the task in 29.93 seconds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939901#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939901&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
