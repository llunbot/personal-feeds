{"title":"Employee pricing for all, tariffs on the sticker: OEMs react to tariffs","link":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/how-automakers-like-ford-vw-stellantis-are-reacting-to-trumps-25-tariff/","date":1743696028000,"content":"<p>New <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/\">25 percent tariffs on all foreign car imports</a> into the United States went into effect this week as President Trump ignited his new trade war. It has caused something of a rush at dealerships around the country as customers descend on existing stock in an attempt to beat <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/trump-on-car-tariffs-i-couldnt-care-less-if-they-raise-prices/\">looming price increases</a> of thousands of dollars. Now we're starting to see how the automakers are reacting.</p>\n<h2>Employee pricing for all</h2>\n<p>Ford is in the rather enviable position of having the least exposure to the new vehicle tariff than all but Tesla; less than 20 percent of the cars, trucks, and SUVs that Ford sells in the US are imported from abroad. And it will lean into that with a new ad campaign with the slogan \"From America, For America,\" which launches today. (Note that this does not take into account the separate parts tariff that goes into effect before May 2.)</p>\n<p>Never mind the slogan, though. The campaign extends Ford's \"A plan\" pricing, which in plain English is its employee discount, to all its customers. The blue oval is offering A plan pricing on most 2024 and 2025 vehicles, including the all-electric F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, as well as its various hybrids.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/how-automakers-like-ford-vw-stellantis-are-reacting-to-trumps-25-tariff/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/how-automakers-like-ford-vw-stellantis-are-reacting-to-trumps-25-tariff/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
