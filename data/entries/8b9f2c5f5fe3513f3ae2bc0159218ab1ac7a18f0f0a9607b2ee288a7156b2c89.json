In addition, we just finished all of the in-person AWS Summits in Asia-Pacific and Japan starting from AWS Summit Sydney and AWS Summit Tokyo in April to AWS Summit ASEAN, AWS Summit Seoul, and AWS Summit Mumbai in May.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/29/wir-may-29summit-collage.jpg\" alt width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" /></p> \n<p>Thank you to everyone who attended our AWS Summits in APJ, especially the AWS Heroes, AWS Community Builders, and AWS User Group leaders, for your collaboration in supporting activities at AWS Summit events.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that caught my attention last week:</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Wickr is now HIPAA eligible</strong> — AWS Wickr is an end-to-end encrypted enterprise messaging and collaboration tool that enables one-to-one and group messaging, voice and video calling, file sharing, screen sharing, and location sharing, without increasing organizational risk. With this announcement, you can now use AWS Wickr for workloads that are within the scope of HIPAA. Visit <a href=\"https://wickr.com/secure-communication-for-healthcare/\">AWS Wickr</a> to get started.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/29/wickr-pro-screens-4-1-300x190.png\" alt width=\"300\" height=\"190\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Redshift announces support for auto-commit statements in stored procedure</strong> — If you’re using stored procedures in Amazon Redshift, you now have enhanced transaction controls that enable you to automatically commit the statements inside the procedure. This new NONATOMIC mode can be used to handle exceptions inside a stored procedure. You can also use the new PL/pgSQL statement RAISE to programmatically raise the exception, which helps prevent disruptions in applications due to an error inside a stored procedure. For more information on using this feature, refer to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/stored-procedure-transaction-management.html\">Managing transactions</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Chatbot supports access to Amazon CloudWatch dashboards and logs insights in chat channels</strong> — With this launch, you now can receive Amazon CloudWatch alarm notifications for an incident directly in your chat channel, analyze the diagnostic data from the dashboards, and remediate directly from the chat channel without switching context. Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/what-is.html\">AWS Chatbot</a> page to learn more.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><span><strong>AWS Open Source Updates</strong></span><br /> As always, my colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/094459\">Ricardo</a> has <a href=\"https://blog.beachgeek.co.uk/newsletter/\">curated the latest updates</a> for open source news at AWS. Here are some of the highlights:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/host-openemr-on-aws-fargate\">OpenEMR on AWS Fargate</a> — OpenEMR is a popular Electronic Health and Medical Practice management solution. If you’re looking to deploy OpenEMR on AWS, then this repo will help you to get your OpenEMR up and running on AWS Fargate using Amazon ECS.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/29/OpenEMR_Auth-300x188.png\" alt width=\"300\" height=\"188\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/DontShaveTheYak/cloud-radar\">Cloud-Radar</a> — If you’re working with AWS Cloudformation and looking for performing unit tests, then you might want to try Cloud-Radar. You can also perform functional testing with Cloud-Radar as this tool also acts a wrapper around Taskcat.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Amazon and Generative AI</span><br /> </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.science/blog/using-generative-ai-to-improve-extreme-multilabel-classification\">Using generative AI to improve extreme multilabel classification </a>— In their research on extreme multilabel classification (XMC), Amazon scientists explored a generative approach, in which a model generates a sequence of labels for input sequences of words. The generative models with clustering consistently outperformed them. This demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating hierarchical clustering in improving XMC performance.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/29/wir-may-29genai-300x169.png\" alt width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Upcoming AWS Events</strong></span><br /> Don’t miss upcoming AWS-led events happening soon:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://siliconinnovationday.splashthat.com/\">AWS Silicon Innovation Day</a> (June 21)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/london/\">AWS Summit London</a> (June 7)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/washington-dc/\">AWS Summit in Washington, DC</a> (June 7 &amp; 8)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/toronto/\"> AWS Summit Toronto</a> (June 14)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Also, let’s learn from our fellow builders and give them support by attending AWS Community Days:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://awscommunity.pl/\">AWS Community Day Warsaw</a> in Poland (June 1),</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.midwestcommunityday.com/\">AWS Community Day Midwest</a> in Chicago, USA (June 15),</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.cl/e/aws-security-community-day-chile-2023-tickets-622605548957\">AWS Community Day Security Edition in Chile</a> (July 1),</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://community.awsug.ph/2023/index.html\">AWS Community Day Philippines</a> (July 29-30).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>That’s all for this week.
