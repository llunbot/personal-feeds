Android 15 won't be out until around October, but the first preview shipped a month ago. It's time for another one!</p>\n<p>Android's satellite messaging support has been in the works for about a year now, and it sounds like Android 15 is going to launch the feature for apps. The new OS is including notifications and better status bar indicators for when you're connected to space. A \"NonTerrestrialNetwork\" API will let apps know when they're limited to barely there satellite connectivity. Google says Android 15 will let third-party SMS and MMS applications tap into the satellite connectivity APIs, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/apple-announces-rcs-support-for-imessage/\">enhanced messaging</a> with RCS support will be limited to \"preloaded\" applications only. It seems incredible that Google doesn't have public APIs for third-party RCS apps, but here's your confirmation that Android 15 will continue locking out Play Store apps from RCS.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-000.png\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            Android 15's new satellite messaging UI.

First it's going to end up as a module so it can be updated via the Play Store. Google says this Android 15 version is getting \"advanced features such as rendering password-protected files, annotations, form editing, searching, and selection with copy.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011931#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011931&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"860c512191f21e8dc4c8dd8c8a8fd062233636036773cdd274d2e7949c1c57f1","category":"Tech"}
