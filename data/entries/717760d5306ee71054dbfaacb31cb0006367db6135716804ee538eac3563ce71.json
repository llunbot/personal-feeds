Given the space constraints of apartments here, my partner and I are relegated to each having a single bicycle. I sold my dedicated road bike in early 2020 to build something with a bit more ‘range’, riding style wise and ended up picking up a Straggler. It was the first new bike I’d ever purchased, and it reinvigorated my love for cycling. I don’t know if I would have survived the lockdown and extended pandemic here in the city if I didn’t have that machine to escape with. Since it was my first bike purchase in many years, it taught me a lot about what had changed since my 2007 Pacer was built. I learned a lot more about geometry, componentry how to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/The-Radavist-Readers-Rides-06-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/The-Radavist-Readers-Rides-08-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Ultimately, I learned enough to know that the Straggler wasn’t the perfect bike for me- I appreciated the roads it opened up to me but missed the snappier ride feel of the Pacer. Since I can’t seem to stay away from Surlys, I picked up a Midnight Special frameset and decided I would learn how to build a bike up from parts. I could only find it in black, but given the current circumstances or supply I had zero complaints and felt incredibly lucky to even find one in my size. I worked with a custom paint shop to have it stripped and coated with a glossy clear powder coat (this was 100% inspired by @freewheelimages who’s been featured here and did the exact same thing to his MS). A lot of the build kit would come off of the Straggler but I still needed to source some bits. Massive shout out to King Kog for always helping me out- they’ve been a huge part of dialing in both the Straggler and my new MS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/The-Radavist-Readers-Rides-02-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Most of my riding is in the city, or just out of it along River Road and Route 9W, but I get out onto mixed surfaces through the Catskills as often as I can to sleep under the stars with my partner and our friends, so I wanted to build this up as an all-road bike. Something that’s capable of extended hours in the saddle over all sorts of terrain, but also fun as hell when I want to feel fast (I’m not fast) on pure road rides. When it’s not taking me on adventures, it’s taking me to and from work, or just rolling around Brooklyn. At the end of the day, it’s a bike I love looking at almost as much as I love riding it. Actually, looking at it just makes me want to go ride it more. Isn’t that the point?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/The-Radavist-Readers-Rides-09-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/The-Radavist-Readers-Rides-05-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\nFrameset: 54cm Surly Midnight Special<br />\nWheels: Mason x Hunt 650b Adventure Dynamo<br />\nTires: Teravail Ramparts 47, light &amp; supple<br />\nDrivetrain: SRAM Rival 1x w/ Wolftooth 42t direct mount chainring and Sunrace 11-42 cassette<br />\nBrakes: TRP Spyres w/ Yokozuna compressionless` housing<br />\nBars: 46cm Salsa Cowchipper Deluxe<br />\nTape: Supacaz Super Sticky Kush<br />\nPedals: Shimano M520<br />\nSaddle: Brooks All Weather C15 carved<br />\nSecurity: Hexlox (seriously best security system I’ve used and looks so sleek)<br />\nSmall parts: Chris King headset, Thomson seat post and collar, Velo Orange tall stack stem, King Cage Iris cages</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
