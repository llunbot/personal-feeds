The long fur was created through the simultaneous editing of as many as seven genes, all with a known connection to hair growth, color, and/or texture.</p>\n<p>But don't think that this is a sort of mouse-mammoth hybrid. Most of the genetic changes were first identified in mice, not mammoths. So, the focus is on the fact that the team could do simultaneous editing of multiple genes—something that they'll need to be able to do to get a considerable number of mammoth-like changes into the elephant genome.</p>\n<h2>Of mice and mammoths</h2>\n<p>The team at Colossal Biosciences has started a number of de-extinction projects, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/the-next-de-extinction-target-the-dodo/\">the dodo</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/effort-to-bring-back-the-tasmanian-tiger-builds-steam/\">thylacine</a>, but its flagship project is the mammoth. In all of these cases, the plan is to take stem cells from a closely related species that has not gone extinct, and edit a series of changes based on the corresponding genomes of the deceased species. In the case of the mammoth, that means the elephant.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/wooly-mice-a-test-run-for-mammoth-gene-editing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/wooly-mice-a-test-run-for-mammoth-gene-editing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d3a2d20703dbb1f3988c8c6faf32f4f612f4780b4f0712e25abfbc2c8dedec0e","category":"Tech"}
