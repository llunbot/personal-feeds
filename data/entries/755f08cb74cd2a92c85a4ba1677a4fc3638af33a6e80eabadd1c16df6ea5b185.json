They quote former CEO Eric Schmidt's notorious remarks on Google's policy to \"<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/10/googles-ceo-the-laws-are-written-by-lobbyists/63908/\">get right up to the creepy line but not cross it</a>.\" They unfavorably compare Apple and Google's approaches to account data combination, voice search privacy, maps, and search. And most notably, they give over an entire slide to a summary: \"Android is a massive tracking device.\"</p>\n<p>The exhibit is, as noted, redacted for public filing and abridged, so slides not pertaining to Google's search dominance and other issues at trial are missing. Still, Apple's presentation offers a rare glimpse into the company's perception of Google, particularly Android, and how its own devices and services might stand apart.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980725#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980725&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"755f08cb74cd2a92c85a4ba1677a4fc3638af33a6e80eabadd1c16df6ea5b185","category":"Tech"}
