According to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_4-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-2242707-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">developer release notes</a>, CarPlay with Apple Maps support has been updated:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In iOS 17.4, with supported CarPlay vehicles, Apple Maps will present a new instrument cluster experience with information about upcoming maneuvers. Users will be able to swap the desired display type between the main and instrument cluster screen by tapping the map configuration button on the upper right of the Maps main screen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this feature works “between the main and instrument cluster screen,” it appears that it’s for CarPlay implementations that use two screens. Most cars use only the main screen located in the center of the car console for CarPlay. Apple added the ability for CarPlay to work on the instrument cluster screen and display maneuver cards in iOS 13. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WWDC in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2159382/next-gen-carplay-vehicles-2024.html\">Apple previewed “the next generation of CarPlay,”</a> a yet-to-be-released version of CarPlay that completely takes over the dashboard. <a>Porsche has previewed next-gen CarPlay</a>, and the first cars with the software are supposed to ship this year, but no formal announcements have been made. The new CarPlay feature in the iOS 17.4 beta 4 is separate from next-gen CarPlay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn more about the in-auto experience in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233855/carplay-faq.html\">CarPlay FAQ</a>.
