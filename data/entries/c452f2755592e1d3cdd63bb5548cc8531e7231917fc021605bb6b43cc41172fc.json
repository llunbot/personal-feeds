A lawsuit from Nuance Communications-owned VB Assets, previously known as VoiceBox Technologies, claimed to have already invented a circular speaker that could connect to the web and answer voice-dictated prompts with a female, robotic voice.</p>\n<p>Wednesday's judgment [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Amazon-VB-Assets-ruling.pdf\">PDF</a>], initially reported by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-must-pay-467-mln-voice-assistant-patent-case-us-jury-says-2023-11-08/\">Reuters</a>, orders Amazon to pay the sum via <a href=\"https://advance.lexis.com/open/document/openwebdocview/Running-Royalties-IP-Technology-Glossary-/?pdmfid=1000522&amp;pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fanalytical-materials%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5NNM-1M71-F65M-60NW-00000-00&amp;pdcomponentid=149080\">running royalty</a> rather than a lump sum. The ruling follows a jury verdict [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VB-Assets-v-Amazon-jury-verict.pdf\">PDF</a>] finding that Amazon infringed upon four of VoiceBox's patents. The patents relate to providing network-coordinated conversational services, a conversational voice user interface, and tying advertisements to natural language processing of voice-based input. VB Assets originally accused Amazon of infringing on six of its patents.</p>\n<p>Amazon still has time to appeal the judgment, and VoiceBox has time to seek reimbursement for related costs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983039#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983039&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c452f2755592e1d3cdd63bb5548cc8531e7231917fc021605bb6b43cc41172fc","category":"Tech"}
