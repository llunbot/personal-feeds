{"title":"OPSEC Isn’t Even the Worst Part of ‘SignalGate’","link":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/signalgate-is-bad-but-opsec-isnt-even-the-worst-part-of-it","date":1742935043000,"content":"\n<p>Josh Marshal, writing at Talking Points Memo:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Especially in the national security domain, many things the\ngovernment does have to remain secret. Sometimes those things\nremain secret for years or decades. But they’re not secrets <em>from</em>\nthe U.S. government. The U.S. government owns all those\ncommunications, all those facts of its own history. Using a Signal\napp like this is hiding what’s happening from the government\nitself. And that is almost certainly not an unintended byproduct\nbut the very reason for the use. These are disappearing\ncommunications. They won’t be in the National Archives. Future\nadministrations won’t know what happened. There also won’t be any\nrecords to determine whether crimes were committed.</p>\n\n<p>This all goes to the fundamental point Trump has never been able\nto accept: that the U.S. government is the property of the\nAmerican people and it persists over time with individual\nofficeholders merely temporary occupants charged with\nadministering an entity they don’t own or possess.</p>\n\n<p>Think this is hyperbole? Remember that when Trump held his\nnotorious meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in 2019 he\nconfiscated his translator’s notes and ordered him not to divulge\nanything that had been discussed. Remember that Trump got\nimpeached over an extortion plot recorded in the government record\nof his phone call with President Zelensky. An intelligence analyst\ndiscovered what had happened and decided he needed to report the\nconduct. These aren’t hypotheticals. They’ve already happened. And\nhe’s even been caught. Which is probably one reason there’s so\nmuch use of Signal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/opsec-not-the-worst-of-it\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"73c62eb79a61d7fd5faceaec805573d9fb7de4e616296c3ac22b7993f7dc38e7","category":"Tech"}
