When stored carbs are depleted, your body starts to convert fat into ketones. Studies show that ketones are 28% more efficient than glucose, making them a super-efficient fuel source for the brain and the body.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These benefits led H.V.M.N to create Ketone-IQ: a drinkable ketone designed to support energy, focus and endurance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Developed alongside the U.S. military, Ketone-IQ is one of the most powerful ketone supplements on the market. It’s designed to elevate your ketone levels for up to 4 hours – much longer than other products. Plus, it’s vegan, caffeine free, and compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s guidelines. That’s a major win for athletes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ketone-IQ Shots are the best way to get your ketones on the go. They’re portable, convenient, and fit perfectly in your pocket during a ride or a race.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can save 20% on Ketone-IQ using the promo code CYCLIST at <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?\" target=\"_blank\">https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about achieving your ultimate metabolic potential, subscribe to H.V.M.N’s podcast ‘Health Via Modern Nutrition with Dr Latt Mansor’ on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube.
