So it makes sense that \"light-based wireless communications,\" or LiFi, could blow the theoretical doors off existing radio-wave wireless standards, to the tune of <a href=\"https://lifi.co/lifi-speed/\">a maximum 224GB per second</a>. <strong>[Edit, 2:40 p.m.: </strong>It does not make sense, and those doors would remain on each rhetorical vehicle. As pointed out by commenters, radio waves, in a vacuum, would reasonably be expected to travel at the same speed as light. Ars, but moreso the author personally, regrets the error. Original post continues.<strong>]</strong></p>\n<p>So long as there's nothing blocking the space between your receiver and the lightbulb you've fashioned into a LiFi access point. Or you don't need to turn the bulb off entirely to sleep. And you're willing to add a dongle and keep it pointed the right way, at least for the moment.</p>\n<p>But LiFi, or 802.11bb, isn't really meant to replace Wi-Fi, but complement it—a good thing for a technology theoretically nullified by a sheet of printer paper. In an announcement of <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230712214664/en/Global-LiFi-Firms-Welcome-the-Release-of-IEEE-802.11bb-Global-Light-Communications-Standard\">the standard's certification by IEEE</a> (<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/your-next-router-could-be-a-lightbulb-ultra-fast-li-fi-tech-just-took-a-major-step-toward-mass-market-availability/\">spotted on PC Gamer</a>) and <a href=\"https://lifi.co/lifi-faqs/\">on LiFiCO's FAQ page</a>, the LED-based wireless standard is pitched as an alternative for certain use cases. LiFi could be useful when radio frequencies are inhibited or banned, when the security of the connection is paramount, or just whenever you want speed-of-light transfer at the cost of line-of-sight alignment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953940#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953940&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d967b94fb2abf73a4c16c2660e4fd79ce93fbb5fa762df7801a5c0d50f88b15","category":"Tech"}
