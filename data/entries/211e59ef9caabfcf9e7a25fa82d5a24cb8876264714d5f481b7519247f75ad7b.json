Tim Cook, Apple’s chief\nexecutive, declined, said two people familiar with the decision.</p>\n\n<p>The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump. As he hopscotched from\nSaudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump took a number\nof shots at Mr. Cook. During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump\npaused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for\ntraveling to the Middle East along with the White House\ndelegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook.</p>\n\n<p>“I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr.\nHuang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of\nthe asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of\nCitigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The presumption here is that Trump’s (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/23/california-ag-trump-apple-tariff-00368619\">possibly illegal</a>) threats of applying a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones, no matter where they’re assembled, are payback for Cook declining to attend this trip in Trump’s entourage of CEOs. When you cave to a bully/extortionist, the bullying/extortion don’t stop. Apple doesn’t really have any significant business interests in countries like Saudi Arabia or Qatar, and it’s not hard to see why an even vaguely ethical business leader <a href=\"https://www.status.news/p/jeff-bezos-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-ai-deal\">would not want to cozy up with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Cook was just busy. But maybe Cook, just 100-some days into the Trump 2.0 administration, is already past his “<em>look, he won the election, let’s give him a chance</em>” stage.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/27/cook-trump-middle-east\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"211e59ef9caabfcf9e7a25fa82d5a24cb8876264714d5f481b7519247f75ad7b","category":"Tech"}
