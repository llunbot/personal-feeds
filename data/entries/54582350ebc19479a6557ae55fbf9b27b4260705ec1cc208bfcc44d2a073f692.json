By setting up multiple access points in a home or office, they form a mesh system that ensures Wi-Fi coverage is available throughout.</p>\n<h2>Remotely injecting arbitrary commands</h2>\n<p>Last year, researchers on Cisco’s Talos security team discovered four vulnerabilities and privately reported them to Netgear. The most severe of the vulnerabilities, tracked as <a href=\"https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1596\">CVE-2022-37337</a>, resides in the access control functionality of the RBR750. Hackers can exploit it to remotely execute commands by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the device. The hacker must first connect to the device, either by knowing the SSID password or by accessing an unprotected SSID. The severity of the flaw is rated 9.1 out of a possible 10.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926153#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926153&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54582350ebc19479a6557ae55fbf9b27b4260705ec1cc208bfcc44d2a073f692","category":"Tech"}
