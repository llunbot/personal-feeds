The studio dropped the official trailer for <em>Joker: Folie à Deux,</em> the sequel to 2019's smash hit <em>Joker</em>, starring Joaquin Phoenix. This time, he's joined by fellow asylum inmate Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) to bring a comic book criminal partnership for the ages to gritty life.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for 2019's <em>Joker</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Joker </em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/review-joker-is-a-powerful-portrayal-of-a-troubled-mans-descent-into-madness/\">was intended to be a standalone film</a>—part of DC Films' <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/dc-wonder-woman-movie-strategy-universe.html\">decision to move</a> away from the shared-universe approach of its prior franchise DCEU films. (DC Studios CEO James Gunn is now calling it the \"DC Elseworld\" project.) It had no relation to the <em>Justice League </em>films that came before, so that freed Phillips to create his own darker, grittier version of this iconic character. He cited Martin Scorsese films like <em>Taxi Driver, Raging Bull</em>, and <em>The King of Comedy</em> among his influences. There's no real origin story for the Joker in the comics—not <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-10-04/joker-ending-explained-todd-phillips\">a definitive one</a>, anyway—so Phillips and screenwriter Scott Silver were able to cherry-pick the canonical elements they needed and make up the rest. (In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke\"><em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em></a>, for instance, the Joker is a failed comedian.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038604#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038604&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"15f0fbf804d7022c0184b2deb5a5061009ab840747ad46c1546e3b25c7349d5c","category":"Tech"}
