At the base of the fork, on the non-drive side, you’ll see what looks to be two rockers. The top one drives the shock, while the lower rocker serves to prevent braking forces from forcing compression or extension of the shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, this design aims to overcome this drawback of a common telescoping design wherein front wheel braking can force the fork into compression, something that is often referred to as fork dive. With the brake caliper mounted to the lower rocker, or torque arm, those forces are isolated from the suspension’s action, such that it neither has a tendency to dive, or rise, when the rider grabs the front brake. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023-800x1200.jpg\" alt=\"motion engineering 120mm travel linkage fork 3d printed prototype rocker driving air shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-120mm-travel-linkage-fork-prototype-3d-printed-eurobike-2023.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive-800x1200.jpg\" alt=\"motion 120mm xc fork linage view birds eye\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-lightweight-xc-braking-torque-arm-anti-dive.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That matters on the trail, because if braking is robbing you of early-stroke travel, there is less stroke available to absorb actual bumps you might encounter. And, when you do hit a bump while braking, the fork has moved deeper into its travel where more force is required for compression. If the Motion XC fork can stay high in its travel under braking, then it stands to reason that it will maintain more of its small bump sensitivity with more travel in reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-linkage-fork-air-shock-lightweight-120mm-travel-xc-riding-lefty-crown.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"motion engineering 120mm xc fork half crown lightweight 1200g claimed weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-linkage-fork-for-xc-riding-120mm-travel-remote-lockout.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And, this one’s a half-crown design. This goes a long way to bringing down the fork’s overall weight. This was one of Motion’s top priorities; they wanted to make an XC fork that is lighter than the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021-rockshox-sid-sl-is-lightest-ever-plus-sid-ultimate-goes-to-120mm-w-new-sid-luxe-rear-shock/\" target=\"_blank\">Rockshox SID Ultimate</a>, which is currently <em>one of</em> the (but not <em><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/worlds-lightest-120mm-fork-intend-samurai/\" target=\"_blank\">the</a></em>) lightest 120mm travel mountain bike forks money can buy. That weighs around 1,300 grams, while Motion Engineering’s equivalent leading-linkage design weighs a claimed 1,200 grams – we’re waiting to hear back on which shock that uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork leg, if you will, will be a monocoque carbon design, with a carbon steerer tube molded as part of the same structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion Engineering’s aim is to work closely with brands to develop a fork as part of their frames. Indeed, the plan is for this 120mm travel offering to be an OEM component only, and thus not available aftermarket. Motion will offer brands the opportunity to tune the fork’s linkage to their needs, giving them more control over how the frame works in conjunction with the behavior of the front end of the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanical Engineer, Finan Levingston, tells us that the Motion fork will exhibit much less friction than a modern telescoping fork, thus conferring improved small bump sensitivity. And of course, compression of the shock is controlled via a linkage, so tuneable progression can be engineered into the linkage, just as brands do for a frame linkage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs-800x1067.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motion-engineering-prototype-xc-120mm-fork-leading-linkage-designs.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3D printed fork on display at Eurobike is one of Motion’s more basic designs, but a poster on the wall at their booth depicts a number of possible iterations of the leading-linkage design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll keep in touch with the folks at Motion Engineering to keep you guys updated on developments as and when they come.
