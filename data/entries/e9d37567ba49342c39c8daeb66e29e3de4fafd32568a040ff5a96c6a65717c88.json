We loved their fantastic audio quality, great noise canceling, and lengthy battery life. “On the outside, not much has changed with these second-generation AirPods Pro. But the sound quality has improved a lot, noise canceling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par,” we wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve only gotten better since then with new features such as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541938/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-how-to.html\">Conversation Boost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2498966/your-airpods-pro-2-can-now-work-as-a-hearing-aid-heres-how.html\">Hearing Protection</a>, which offers a clinical-grade hearing test and the option to use your AirPods Pro 2 as a genuine hearing aid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the buds are extremely easy to pair with other Apple devices, allowing you to switch between them in a blink. Exercising with the AirPods Pro 2 in your ears is also perfectly possible since they deliver a secure fit and have water and sweat resistance. And of course, they work with hands-free Siri for answering calls and playing music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don’t miss out on the chance to get your hands on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\">AirPods Pro 2 for $170 at Amazon</a> because this deal won’t stick around forever.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save 32% on the AirPods Pro 2</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e9d37567ba49342c39c8daeb66e29e3de4fafd32568a040ff5a96c6a65717c88","category":"Apple"}
