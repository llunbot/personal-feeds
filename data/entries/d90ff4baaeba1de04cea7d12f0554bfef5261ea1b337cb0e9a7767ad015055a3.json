Epic is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/epic-games-webshops-ios-developers/\">going to launch Epic Games Store Webshops</a> that will allow other developers to deploy digital storefronts outside of the Apple's App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 17 Pro's Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display Coating Canceled</h2>\r<br />\nWhile Apple was reportedly aiming to bring an anti-reflective display coating to the iPhone 17 Pro models this year, a reliable source now tells <em>MacRumors</em> that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/28/iphone-17-anti-reflective-coating-canceled/\">the plan has been canceled</a> for now as Apple ran into difficulties scaling up the process for the millions of devices it will need to produce.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-display.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1780\" height=\"1001\" />\r<br />\nApple has brought anti-reflective nano-texture display options to several recent products like the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, but so far the iPhone has been limited to a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating that still leaves the glass fronts of the devices susceptible to glare.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>All iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature 12GB of RAM</h2>\r<br />\nWe're expecting at least some iPhone 17 models to see an increase in RAM to 12GB from the current 8GB, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/all-iphone-17-models-feature-12gb-of-ram/\">new rumor claims that the increase will extend to all four models in the lineup</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple had originally been thought to only include the higher RAM amount in the iPhone 17 Pro Max, though analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicated last week that it will extend to not only the iPhone 17 Pro and the \"iPhone 17 Air,\" but potentially even the base iPhone 17 if supply chain issues can be overcome. This week's rumor from Digital Chat Station on Weibo claims this will indeed be possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Google CEO Suggests iOS 19 Will Feature Built-In Gemini Integration</h2>\r<br />\nWhile ChatGPT is currently the only third-party AI service integrated into Apple Intelligence on iPhones, Apple has reportedly been open to adding other services, with Google Gemini regarded as the most likely future addition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-gemini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAs part of an ongoing antitrust trial against Google, its CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed that he has held discussions with Apple CEO Tim Cook about Gemini integration and he hopes a deal will be reached by the middle of this year. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/ios-19-google-gemini-integration-likely/\">That timing would set the stage for the inclusion of Gemini in iOS 19</a>, set to be introduced at WWDC next month ahead of a public launch in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>The MacRumors Show: Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3 Rumors</h2>\r<br />\nOn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/02/the-macrumors-show-series-11-ultra-3-se-3/\">latest episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, Dan and Hartley discuss what to expect from the 2025 Apple Watch lineup when new models launch in the fall, with updates for the standard Apple Watch, high-end Apple Watch Ultra, and low-end Apple Watch SE all expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/TMRS-144-2025-Apple-Watch-Lineup-Thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nThey also look at the latest rumors about iPadOS 19, where a macOS-style menu bar is expected to appear on-screen when the iPad is connected to a Magic Keyboard. The iPhone could also be getting a Stage Manager-like feature when connected to an external display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/may-1-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/top-stories-epic-games-victory/\">Top Stories: Epic Games Victory Over Apple, iPhone 17 Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-epic-games-victory-over-apple-iphone-17-rumors-and-more.2456427/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d90ff4baaeba1de04cea7d12f0554bfef5261ea1b337cb0e9a7767ad015055a3","category":"Apple"}
