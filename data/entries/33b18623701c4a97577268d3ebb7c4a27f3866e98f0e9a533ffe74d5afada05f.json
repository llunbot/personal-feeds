Matte black high-tops with reflective details and red highlights (natch, for MKBHD), they blend function and style. Designed for everyday comfort, the 251.1 also includes a water-repellent upper and membrane, making it one of the most versatile sneakers you can own.</p>\n\n<p>I’m wearing a pair as I type this, and feel cooler than I have any right to feel at my age. These are great sneakers.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/02/atoms-mkbhd\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"33b18623701c4a97577268d3ebb7c4a27f3866e98f0e9a533ffe74d5afada05f","category":"Tech"}
