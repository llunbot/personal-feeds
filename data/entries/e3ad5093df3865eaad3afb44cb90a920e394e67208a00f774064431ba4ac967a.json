Google accidentally leaked a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1699232915412955224\">bunch of 3D renders</a> the other day, so now that the cat's out of the bag, Google went ahead and made it official.</p>\n<p>We saw live pictures of the Pixel 8 Pro <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/05/the-pixel-8-pros-mystery-sensor-is-a-temperature-sensor/\">in May</a>, so there isn't much to add about the device's design. But still, the video confirms what's coming next month. The biggest change is a switch to a flat screen instead of the distorted curved displays that flagship Android phones have been saddled with. There's also a dubiously useful temperature sensor on the back, which in May was demonstrated as useful for taking a person's body temperature by applying your phone directly to your forehead. The sides are still a shiny mirror finish on the Pro version.</p>\n<p>We get a shot of the cheaper Pixel 8, too. This confirms it still has a satin finish instead of the mirror polish and continues to have only two cameras. It's also not getting the temperature sensor.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966574#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966574&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e3ad5093df3865eaad3afb44cb90a920e394e67208a00f774064431ba4ac967a","category":"Tech"}
