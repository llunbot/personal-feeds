In those cases, knobby tires basically force all good wheel brands to find other ways to differentiate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1743\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hunt 42 Limitless Gravel Adventure wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1-297x259.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1-800x697.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1-120x105.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1-768x669.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-1-1536x1339.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Hunt, they do that by starting with their otherwise very aero 42 Limitless rims, and rebuild them with more spokes, stronger parts, and a simpler, easier-to-service design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"983\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3.jpg\" alt=\"Hunt 42 Limitless Gravel Adventure wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3-297x146.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3-800x393.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3-120x59.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3-768x377.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-3-1536x755.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 42 Limitless Gravel Adventure wheelset does claim to offer class-leading aerodynamic performance, which they say amounts to a whopping 0.12 Watts at the “pointy end of the spear of elite racing”. For the rest of us it offers specifications tailored for fast, loaded ultra-adventures without creating unnecessary drag, and maintaining good crosswind stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1332\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane.jpg\" alt=\"Sofiane riding new Hunt gravel wheels at Bright Midnight race in Norway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hunt-42-Limitless-Gravel-Adventure-Wheels-Sofiane-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed for their HUNT Beyond sponsored athletes and ultra-endurance events like the Traka, Unbound XL, and the Silk Road Mountain Race, they’re also ideal for bikepacking and offroad touring.

The hooked rims provide a little extra security when running lower pressures, too…or wide road tires with higher pressures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claimed weight is 1,642g for the pair (766g front, 879g rear), and MSRP is $1,649 with a pre-order discount available for a limited time.
