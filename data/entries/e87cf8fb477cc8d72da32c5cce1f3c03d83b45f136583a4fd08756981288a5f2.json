Despite being on cholesterol-lowering medications, the volunteers were already suffering from heart disease. They joined a trial in New Zealand and the United Kingdom run by Verve Therapeutics, a Cambridge, Massachusetts–based biotech company.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983992#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983992&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e87cf8fb477cc8d72da32c5cce1f3c03d83b45f136583a4fd08756981288a5f2","category":"Tech"}
