The list has since been updated to include a few more products. In addition to the big store brands, the eye drops were also sold as Leader (Cardinal Health), Rugby (Cardinal Health), and Velocity Pharma branded products.</p>\n<p>All of the products are made by Kilitch Healthcare India Limited in Mumbai. At the time of the FDA's initial warning, the agency said it had found bacterial contamination in critical production areas of the Mumbai facility. As such, the agency warned of a possibility that the products, which are intended to be sterile, may not be and could pose a risk of infection.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984986#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984986&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"019252c37d9ac6995970ed4f8662504d1d13900e5d907639afacd2b947d50276","category":"Tech"}
