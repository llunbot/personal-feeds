It's true that the US space program has always been political. Domestic and global politics have driven nearly all of the US government's decisions on major space issues, most notably President John F. Kennedy's challenge to land astronauts on the Moon amid intense Cold War competition with the Soviet Union. The Nixon administration's decision to end the Apollo program and focus on building a reusable Space Shuttle was a political move. More than 30 years later, the Clinton administration ordered a reevaluation NASA's plans for a massive space station in low-Earth orbit. In the post-Cold War zeitgeist of the 1990s, this resulted in Russia's inclusion on the International Space Station program. Flawed or not, these decisions were backstopped with some level of reasoning, debate, and national consensus-building.

The company launched its 60th Electron rocket Tuesday from New Zealand, <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-and-spacex-perform-launches-minutes-apart/\">Space News reports</a>. It was the second Electron launch of the year, coming just 10 days after Rocket Lab's previous mission. The payload was a new-generation small electro-optical reconnaissance satellite for BlackSky. Rocket Lab has not disclosed a projected number of Electron launches for the year beyond estimating it will be more than the 16 Electron missions in 2024. The company said on its launch webcast that the next Electron launch was planned from New Zealand in \"a few short weeks.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/rocket-report-spacex-lands-in-the-bahamas-ula-tests-modified-booster/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/rocket-report-spacex-lands-in-the-bahamas-ula-tests-modified-booster/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cf06052511a20b264a4c897c531db9838806fc06481cbca5d6005e667e07bf31","category":"Tech"}
