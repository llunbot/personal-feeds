The lawsuit seeks Â£785 million ($995 million) in damages on behalf of UK app developers. The case could potentially benefit up to 13,000 developers who have sold apps or in-app subscriptions to iOS users since July 2017.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lawsuit follows similar challenges worldwide over Apple's App Store policies. Apple in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-eu-app-ecosystem-tidbits/\">January</a> announced changes to its App Store terms in response to European Union regulations, but these modifications have also faced criticism from EU watchdogs for potentially making conditions worse for developers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis latest legal challenge expands on a previous suit <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-app-store-fees/\">filed last year</a>, which initially represented around 1,500 UK developers. Professor Ennis, who previously worked at the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission, secured funding for the case through Harbour Litigation Funding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has consistently defended its App Store practices, maintaining that most developers pay no commission and that the platform provides valuable security and development resources. The company also emphasizes that developers can reach users through web browsers, where Apple's rules don't apply.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-fails-block-uk-app-store-lawsuit/\">Apple Fails to Block $995M UK App Store Commission Lawsuit</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fails-to-block-995m-uk-app-store-commission-lawsuit.2444515/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"288baa409cbf9bf2a7bd8d1d48257a657555eb219b8d22e810a20c5994bb1e36","category":"Apple"}
