With a color display, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uk25dW\" target=\"_blank\">the Halo View</a> can compete with competitors like Fitbit by displaying real-time health metrics, including heart rate and blood oxygen levels.\n<p>The Halo View is Amazon's second Halo-branded fitness tracker. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XULl0S\" target=\"_blank\">Halo Band</a> announced in 2020 offers similar features but doesn't have a screen. The Halo View stands out with a display made with AMOLED, a type of OLED known for even higher contrast and more flexibility. This display can show your sleep scores, track your workouts, and alert you with haptic feedback if you have a text or if you've gone too long since without moving around.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Halo-Band.jpg\" /><p>Amazon Halo Band in silver.
