Yes, this is just a small waterproof roll-top bag – about the size of a large water bottle – that straps around your bike’s frame to give you overflow storage where you didn’t have any. No need for a spare set of cage bolts – it can actually tuck in anywhere you have free space. So, you can strap this thing onto a gravel bike, a bikepacking bike, or even your mountain bike…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Restrap Downtube Bag provides 1.2L of waterproof storage</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_dirty-u-pclose-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_dirty-u-pclose-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Downtube Bag 1.2L extra storage, muddy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_dirty-u-pclose-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_dirty-u-pclose-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_dirty-u-pclose-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_dirty-u-pclose-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_dirty-u-pclose-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Restrap)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Restrap Downtube Bag is meant to be strapped under your downtube – really any ‘dead space’ on the bike you aren’t using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it’s gonna get muddy behind your front tire down there.

It will tuck in between your crankarms, and even behind a big chainring in most cases.  The bag is about 24cm long when packed and will stick down from your frame at least 8cm. And you should leave a couple of extra centimeters for safety’s sake – a lesson learned from personal experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Downtube Bag 1.2L extra storage, gravel race bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-race-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a rule, road &amp; cross bikes often won’t have enough space. Nor will some smaller-sized bikes or those that are really pushing their max tire size limitations. But adventure-y gravel bikes, especially bikepacking-specific bikes should have plenty of room, and most mountain bikes will too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Extra storage wherever you need it</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_Cotic-Jeht-packed.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_Cotic-Jeht-packed.gif\" alt=\"Restrap Downtube Bag 1-2L of extra waterproof on-bike storage, MTB animation\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn’t <em>have </em>to go under your downtube either. A quick bit of bad-photoshopping fun suggests a lot more spots on Restrap’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cotic-jeht-gen2-trail-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Cotic Jeht</a> trail bike that could fit an extra little bag since the steel mountain bike only has one set of bottle cage bosses. It also will sit nicely on a cargo cage, too. I’m not saying that these spots are all good ideas where to stick a Restrap Downtube Bag. But I’ve used a similar bag like this in the past, and definitely strapped it on a dodgy spot and was mostly fine. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Downtube Bag 1-2L of extra waterproof on-bike storage, gravel bikepacking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_gravel-bikepacking-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A small-diameter roll-top bag like this can be a pain in the butt to stuff bigger gear into, like say a rain jacket. A bit easier you can fill it with a couple of spare tubes, a tool, levers, patches, some C02s, and just swap it around from bike to bike in seconds. Any way you look at it, it’s really nice to be able to easily carry more gear on a bike when there aren’t other options. And since this pack is quite small – and adjustable in volume – with a wide secure velcro strap, it tends to actually be quite secure on the bike once you strap it into place. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_NDS-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_NDS-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Downtube Bag 1-2L of extra waterproof on-bike storage, installed NDS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_NDS-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_NDS-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_NDS-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_NDS-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_NDS-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1.2L of additional storage anywhere you can find space to strap it on</li>\n\n\n\n<li>fully waterproof roll-top lined nylon construction, vegan-friendly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>9cm wide x 8cm deep x 24cm long when packed and rolled shut</li>\n\n\n\n<li>secure 5cm wide velcro Hypalon strap, with built-in grip bad to stay in place over any terrain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>long enough to wrap around a 19cm or 7 1/2″ circumference tube (~6cm or 2 3/8″ in diameter)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>fast tool-free install, no cage mounts or braze-ons needed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>130g claimed weight</li>\n\n\n\n<li>made in-house by Restrap in Yorkshire, England</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_closed-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1229\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_closed-1536x1229.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Downtube Bag 1-2L of extra waterproof on-bike storage, packed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_closed-1536x1229.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_closed-297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_closed-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_closed-768x614.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_closed-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_open-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1229\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_open-1536x1229.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Downtube Bag 1-2L of extra waterproof on-bike storage, open flat unpacked\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_open-1536x1229.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_open-297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_open-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_open-768x614.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Restrap-Downtube-Bag-1-2L-of-extra-waterproof-on-bike-storage_open-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Restrap Downtube Bag – Pricing &amp;
