However, this leads him to believe that the \"user experience will not differ from the current model.\" Indeed, it is even possible that these changes will not be announced to the public, beyond a potential price cut.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the Vision Pro in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/\">additional countries</a> before WWDC in June, with reports that the device could be coming to China <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-vision-pro-launch-china-may/\">as soon as next month</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/no-apple-vision-pro-2-before-end-of-2026/\">Gurman: No Apple Vision Pro 2 Launch Planned Before End of 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-apple-vision-pro-2-launch-planned-before-end-of-2026.2425113/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"016ec58779dd004d16bf38a7fcac6ff9198b34d90ddc684bd108d99ed7c003dd","category":"Apple"}
