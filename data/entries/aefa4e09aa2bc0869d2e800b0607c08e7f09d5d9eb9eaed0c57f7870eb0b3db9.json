They’re lighter, very strong, and add a bit of damping and radial compliance while keeping the wheel laterally stiff.

Now, it looks like they’re taking it even further and have a new, wider edge to prevent pinch flats. Or, maybe the rim sidewalls are just thinner to save weight, or both. They weren’t giving up all the tech details on these yet as they’re still prototypes, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-gulo-composites-prototype-xc-mountain-bike-wheels02.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-gulo-composites-prototype-xc-mountain-bike-wheels02-1536x729.jpg\" alt=\"prototype gulo xc mountain bike wheels with ultralight rim and carbon spokes shown on a scale\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-gulo-composites-prototype-xc-mountain-bike-wheels02-1536x729.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-gulo-composites-prototype-xc-mountain-bike-wheels02-297x141.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-gulo-composites-prototype-xc-mountain-bike-wheels02-120x57.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-gulo-composites-prototype-xc-mountain-bike-wheels02-768x364.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-gulo-composites-prototype-xc-mountain-bike-wheels02-2048x972.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Gulo also showed off a bike from their first OEM parter, Neuhaus Metal Works.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…they did throw the front wheel on the scale to show just how light it really is (530g), which is mainly achieved by a new 275g rim.

Since the generally recognized ideal is for the rims to be ever-so-slightly wider than the tires to optimize aerodynamics, that means gravel rims would have to be comically wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that’s basically what Gulo is doing. These prototypes look right at home against 40mm tires, which is a common choice for racing, especially among the pros who don’t mind sacrificing a bit of comfort and grip for all-out speed. Target launch date is around Unbound, more details to come closer to that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://gulocomposites.com\" target=\"_blank\">GuloComposites.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gulo-1140g-xc-sl-wheels-ultra-wide-gravel-wheels/\">Gulo Shows Prototype 1,140g XC Wheels &amp; Ultra-Wide Gravel Wheels</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"aefa4e09aa2bc0869d2e800b0607c08e7f09d5d9eb9eaed0c57f7870eb0b3db9","category":"Cycling"}
