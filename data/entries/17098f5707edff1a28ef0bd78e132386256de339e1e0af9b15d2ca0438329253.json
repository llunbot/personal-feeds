It still delivers a fast and smooth experience, whether you’re working, streaming, or browsing. The Intel Core i5 processor keeps things running efficiently, and with 8GB of RAM, multitasking is smooth. Plus, the 128GB SSD gives you plenty of space for documents, photos, and apps while ensuring quick load times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 13.3-inch display has crisp visuals with a 1440×900 resolution. It also has Intel HD Graphics 6000, so you can expect smooth performance for everyday tasks. And since it supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, connecting to the internet or pairing with other devices is easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things about this MacBook Air is its 12-hour battery life. You can go all day without worrying about charging, whether you’re working remotely, traveling, or just using it around the house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since this model has a Grade “A” refurbished rating, you’re getting a device that’s in near-mint condition at a fraction of the price it originally went for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have until March 30 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get a<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-614696&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003JeZVIA0&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> MacBook Air</a> on sale for $229.97. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-614696&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003JeZVIA0&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/8e94294913be4e484b9c3a9f55ec5e7be35f7d32/store/66343f8a70f7afd627b36e2bccc844214284f70a8188ca8f2230ab099be8/sale_312617_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple MacBook Air 13.3″ (2017) 1.8GHz i5 8GB RAM 128GB SSD Silver (Refurbished) – $229.97</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-614696&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003JeZVIA0&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"17098f5707edff1a28ef0bd78e132386256de339e1e0af9b15d2ca0438329253","category":"Apple"}
