It reportedly reached 5 million players, which is quite a lot for a PC-focused strategy title, so <em>1800</em> was a popularization moment for the franchise, too.</p>\n<p><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em>, due later this year, aims to build on that momentum and turn the franchise into a crossover hit.
