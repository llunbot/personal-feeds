But this week, Tesla dropped the prices of its cars—and not for the first time this year. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/tesla-built-more-cars-than-it-could-sell-in-q1-2023/\">As we reported on Monday</a>, despite sales growing by 36 percent globally, the automaker missed its ambitious target and will need to grow even faster in the remaining months of the year to satisfy investors.</p>\n<p>Perhaps these cuts will help. The biggest price decreases are for the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. All versions of these electric vehicles are now $5,000 cheaper than they were last week, following similar $5,000 price cuts <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/tesla-cuts-models-s-and-x-prices-for-the-second-time-in-eight-weeks/\">a month ago</a> and much larger price cuts in January that saw the Model S Plaid shed $21,000 from its MSRP.</p>\n<p>Model 3 sedans are now $1,000 cheaper across the board, marking their third price cut in recent months. A rear-wheel-drive Model 3 now starts at $41,990—in January, this version cost $43,990; it then dropped <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2023/02/04/tesla-adjusts-pricing-again-model-y-goes-up-model-3-goes-down/\">another $500 in February</a>. Tesla notes that the RWD Model 3 will also lose half of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-how-the-irss-clean-vehicle-tax-credit-will-change-on-april-18/\">the IRS clean vehicle tax credit</a> starting on April 18, although all-wheel drive Model 3s and all Model Ys will still be eligible for the full $7,500 credit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929896#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929896&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
