If you reflect on the last five years of the 29-year-old’s career, you’d be hard-pressed to find a cyclist who has suffered more adversity or bad luck – and who has consistently come back fighting. There have been the contracts that seemed like Franz’s golden ticket to career stability and success, first with Zaaf Cycling Team and then with Lifeplus-Wahoo, then the heartbreak of a lack of funding and sponsorship issues which have left her, once again, searching for a jersey to race her bike in.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Perhaps the most impressive thing about Franz is that despite it all, she remains both grateful to the teams who gave her the opportunity in the first place, and motivated for the future. Part of this stems from the fact that Franz has been close, plenty of times, to that one, big, breakthrough result. She finished in the top-20 of the Gravel World Championships this year (after a turbulent and disturbed season to prepare) and has been in the top-10 of multiple UCI stage races – she might not be winning yet, but her consistency is undeniably impressive.</span></p>\n<p><span>“There have been moments where I have thought, really don't know if I want to keep doing this, because I've worked so hard the last two years to put myself where I think I deserve to have the support that I've earned,” Franz reflects. “At the beginning of August, the team had folded, and within two days I kicked into problem solving mode. I didn't even really have any major, emotional response – I was shocked and really sad at first, and then because of how many times we've had to do this, I just thought: how can I find another team right away? How can I race my bike as soon as possible?”</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-105663_1024x1024.jpg?v=1734697350\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image: Zac Williams/MAAP</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The American rider points to the World Championships in Zurich as a pivotal moment that made her reflect on her turbulent journey in the sport so far: “I remember thinking: how is it possible that I've been selected for my third World Championships on the road in a row for the USA, which is not an easy selection to make, and I've just lost my third team? How does this make any sense? It made me wonder if it was worth trying so stubbornly to advocate for myself when really it doesn't seem like cycling wants me anymore. Is it cycling trying to push me out?”</span></p>\n<p><span>Franz explains that she has those closest to her to thank for pulling her out of a negative mindset following the closure of Lifeplus-Wahoo. Her husband, Wade, immediately took up extra working hours and close friends such as Alison Jackson (who rides for EF-Oatly-Cannondale) ensured Franz was still having fun and getting out on her bike.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Alison offered a warm perspective and positive encouragement to keep going,” Franz says. “I just feel really lucky that I have a really tight group of friends here in Girona. Honestly, there are so many people that came to support us who have been so encouraging and positive. I think my own stubbornness also helped.”</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s a testament to Franz’s sympathetic character that she’s passionate about ensuring more riders don’t face the same struggles she has with teams folding unexpectedly. While she doesn’t blame the specific individuals behind the teams she has ridden for, Franz speaks passionately about the necessity for UCI reforms which will make women’s cycling below the WorldTour level a more professional working environment.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The reason these things happen is because of this larger problem of stability for UCI women's Continental teams. The UCI leaves so much to the Federations and kind of wash their hands and turn away. The riders don’t have protection,” Franz says.</span></p>\n<p><span>She notes that the introduction of the women’s ProTeam level next year from the UCI will be a step forward, but issues will still arise from a lack of support from the UCI to help teams meet the stipulations for that category: “It is almost like they made a really good thing another huge burden on the teams, asking the teams to put down way more money to get this license when, in the fine print, there's actually barely any benefit from having the ProTeam license.</span></p>\n<p><span>“There were so many teams that folded this year, I think the pressure of that step up really crumbled them. With Lifeplus-Wahoo, Tom [Varney, the team’s manager] had told us was that in the end, he felt that continuing the team would actually hold back women's cycling on the whole because they weren't going to be able to provide either the salary or resources, or the support and the infrastructure, that is really required to race at the level that they want to race at. That was such an honest assessment to me and really made me respect their self awareness. It is really sad, but it was also very true,” Franz continues.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/EK_02933_1024x1024.jpg?v=1734697383\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><span> <em>Image: Elliot Keen/MAAP</em></span></p>\n<p><span></span><span>In 2025, Franz will race for American women’s continental team Cynisca Cycling. It’s a team with a roster of just 11 riders, seven of which are from the US. Despite it not being one of the biggest or well-known squads yet, Cynisca has ambitious plans for growth, a solid race calendar and some established talent in its ranks. Franz will be one of the team’s most experienced riders and a leader, alongside Alexis Magner, who was a professional rider for Canyon//SRAM for five years.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I think the things that I am excited about for this team next year are feeling a bit more at home. It is an American team, I do know and really trust the people there. One of the sports directors is an old teammate of mine from Rally and I'm really excited to race with Alexis Magner, because she's someone that I have always looked up to as a bike racer, and I know she's a really awesome human being,” Franz says.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Maybe having a slightly more balanced racing calendar also will help mentally. I think they have a really nice approach to our calendar next year. We're not hitting the really heavy spring Classics season so much. We're having a nice balance of racing in Spain, racing in Belgium for a little bit.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Riding some smaller events may also help Franz go back to the very root of why she loves bike racing. Her passion for the sport is strong enough that it has helped her overcome challenges and setbacks which may have stopped others from pushing forwards, and next year is a chance to remember why she has always kept fighting.</span></p>\n<p><span>“It's a nice mix of smaller stage races and we hope to get in some WorldTour races here and there. It’s funny because back when I was racing on Rally, I was always so bummed that we weren't getting into the big races because I just wanted to do them, and I wanted the experience and all and just to learn from those,” Franz reflects. “Now, some years later, I’ve realised it is really smart to have a good balance. You need to go and learn how to win and really work cohesively as a team in the smaller races before you can really be productive at a WorldTour level.”</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s hard to argue against the fact that Franz is one rider who truly deserves a clear shot at success in 2025. Her resilience in the face of repeated misfortune is proof of how much she wants to fulfil her potential on two wheels and she hopes Cynisca Cycling will be the vehicle to help her do that. It’s time for Franz to finally get that lucky break.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I feel like I know that I haven't been given a fair opportunity to really show what I can do. If I were to leave the sport right now because of this, I think I would have so much regret in the future,” she says. “If I'm just given one more shot, one more clean road in front of me to have a chance, that's what motivates me.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Cover i</span><span>mage: Zac Williams/MAAP</span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"e9e07253270bde29c3703213ff07da06c2dde939441bd47b0468d1a589a223fd","category":"Cycling"}
