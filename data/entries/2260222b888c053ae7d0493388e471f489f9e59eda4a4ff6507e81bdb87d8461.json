A top-of-the-line 256GB <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max can now be bought for 7,949 yuan ($1,199), compared to its 9,999 yuan price tag when the device was released in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, an entry-level 128GB ‌iPhone 15‌ model is currently being offered at the discounted price of 4,599 yuan ($636), down from its previous price of 5,999 yuan. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has become dependent on discounts to shift ‌mid-cycle ‌iPhone 15‌‌ stock, with strong competition from Huawei's latest high-end series of <a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/introduce-the-pura-70-series/\">Pura 70 phones</a> said to be partly behind the most recent drop in sales. Apple's previous discounts in February were thought to be a response to growing interest in Huawei's homegrown Mate 60 series, which launched last August.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple sales in China dropped 13 percent to $20.8 billion in the quarter ended December, falling short of the $23.5 billion predicted by analysts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, despite a gloomy outlook for 2024, Apple's previous promotions in February are believed to have helped counteract its sales slowdown in China. <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slashes-iphone-prices-china-amid-fierce-huawei-competition-2024-05-20/\">Reuters</a></em> reports that Apple's shipments in the country increased by 12% in March, a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/\">Huawei</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-slashes-iphone-15-prices-again-china/\">Apple Responds to Huawei Threat By Slashing iPhone 15 Prices in China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-responds-to-huawei-threat-by-slashing-iphone-15-prices-in-china.2426918/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2260222b888c053ae7d0493388e471f489f9e59eda4a4ff6507e81bdb87d8461","category":"Apple"}
