title=\"Warren Gravel Column\" />                                            <p>I want to divide gravel bikes into categories based on what they’re built for, and I want to do it now.</p>\n<p>The exploding popularity of gravel has brought more people than ever to the world of drop-bar bikes, from dyed-in-the-wool roadies to full-send mountain bikers, via new riders dipping their toe into riding for the first time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">Gravel riding</a> has opened up new horizons for just about everyone – including bike brands keen to jump on the bandwagon, and that means we’re experiencing something of a bout of growing pains when it comes to the huge range of gravel bikes out there.</p>\n<p>While mountain bikes have diversified into an ever-confusing amount of sub-genres, as the sport has evolved into wide variety of disciplines and sub-discipines, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> are often lumped together as one category: gravel.</p>\n<p>It’s time for the great gravel divide to take place, to establish useful – and that’s the key here – sub-categories for riders trying to navigate the huge number of options out there.</p>\n<p>It’s something I’ve been vocal about in the past on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/listen-to-bikeradar-podcast/\">BikeRadar Podcast</a> and over on our YouYube channel when I pitted two very different gravel bikes – the Surly Grappler and Scott Addict Gravel head-to-head.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time to commit words to the page, though, with my take on the future direction of gravel categorisation.</p>\n\n<h2>But first, some gravel tech history</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Many early 'gravel' bikes were adapted from cyclocross bikes.\" title=\"1249298642011-dv15yhcflyik-a2e0562\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many early ‘gravel’ bikes were adapted from cyclocross bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>Back in the earliest proto-days of drop-bar, off-road riding – and we could argue for days on the true origins of ‘gravel’ – the most frequent dismissal was that gravel bikes were either a) just <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">cyclocross bikes</a> with rack fittings or b) just ‘90s mountain bikes with drop handlebars.</p>\n<p>In truth, ever since the earliest gravel-ready bikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/cyclocross-bikes/specialized-tricross-sport-review-2/\">Specialized Tricross</a> (a cyclocross bike for the road or trail) or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/touring-bikes/second-opinion-salsa-fargo-review/\">Salsa’s Fargo</a>, both from 2009, that same argument has been rolling on.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"This is a gravel bike, but it wasn't known as such when it was originally released.\" title=\"1402782882183-1nlrngbn6pu67-a75862f\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is a gravel bike, but it wasn’t known as such when it was originally released.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Future Publishing</i></span></div>\n<p>Even when gravel became more established – originally under the influence of small-builders and custom thinkers – stand-out, landmark bikes from big brands, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/gt-grade-endurance-bike-launched/\">GT’s original Grade in 2014</a>, made things even more confusing.</p>\n<p>You see, GT had made a cutting-edge (for the time) gravel bike, but didn’t want to call it that.</p>\n<p>The brand saw it as more of an all-roader or wide-tyred endurance bike; capable everywhere, on any surface. It took some time for bike brands to commit to the idea of gravel, when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes/\">endurance bikes</a> were previously all the rage.</p>\n<p>Now gravel is fully established as a category, we can be almost sure that’s where the new Grade – due some time in 2023 – will pin its colours to the mast. But where on the gravel spectrum will it sit?</p>\n<p>A decade (or near enough) is a long time in bike tech and, in the years between 2014 and 2023, we’ve seen the gravel category become fully established and, conversely, balloon to the point that two bikes can be classed as ‘gravel’ and offer very different qualities.</p>\n<h2>It’s time to reclassify gravel bikes</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Pete-Sampsons-gravel-Giant-TCR-21-of-2-f5c52a5.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"'Gravel bike' means something different for all riders.

There’s no perfect separation here, but by re-categorising gravel, we’ll get a better idea of where each machine shines.</p>\n<p>Let’s get down to business then. Here’s my manifesto for a new four-way split of gravel bike categories – and what to expect from bikes in each.</p>\n<h3>Gravel race bikes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BMC Kaius ONE 01 gravel bike\" title=\"BMC Kauis 01 One - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The BMC Kauis is probably the sharpest gravel race bike out there today.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Gravel race bikes are optimised for speed over rough terrain.</p>\n<p>A gravel race bike can just as easily be focused on low weight (we’re looking at you, Specialized Crux) or, more likely, aerodynamics, with road-like riding positions and limited fixtures and fittings, compared to more adventure-targeted machines.</p>\n<p>A lot of gravel race bikes will stick close to fast <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">road bike geometry</a>. They won’t deviate far from the traditional parallel 73-degree head and seat tube angles, and will have stack and reach numbers that pro riders won’t turn their noses up at.</p>\n<p>Expect a slightly extended wheelbase to take into account larger tyre sizes, but that’s pretty much the only difference you’ll see glancing at a geometry table.</p>\n<p>Builds will err towards close-ratio gearing; expect 2x Shimano GRX Di2, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-rockshox-zipp-xplr/\">SRAM XPLR</a> and Campagnolo Ekar with one of its tighter 13-speed cassette options. You’ll get 40mm tyres as a maximum – perhaps with additional clearance for 45mm – and handlebars that keep things narrow, ignoring the wide and flared trend for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-handlebars/\">gravel handlebars</a>, for a more aero-minded roadie position.</p>\n<p>These bikes are all about speed for the fittest (and foolhardy).</p>\n<h4>Gravel race bikes reviewed by BikeRadar</h4>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-s-works-crux-review/\">Specialized Crux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-diverge-str-expert-review/\">Specialized Diverge STR</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/cannondale-topstone-carbon-rival-axs-review/\">Cannondale Topstone Carbon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/bmc-kaius-01-one-review/\">BMC Kaius</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/factor-ostro-gravel-review/\">Factor Ostro Gravel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/scott-addict-gravel-30-review/\">Scott Addict Gravel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/2022-giant-revolt-advanced-pro-0/\">Giant Revolt Advanced Pro 0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/3t-exploro-racemax-review/\">3T Exploro RaceMax</a></li>\n<li>Orbea Terra</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/trek-checkpoint-sl-6-etap-review/\">Trek Checkpoint SL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/ridley-kanzo-fast-grx-di2-classified-first-ride-review/\">Ridley Kanzo Fast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/pinarello-grevil-f-review/\">Pinarello Grevil F</a></li>\n</ul><h3>All-road gravel</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus Venon Evo RS Aero Force AXS\" title=\"Vitus Venon EVO RS Aero Force AXS\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vitus Venon EVO, which won our 2023 Bike of the Year award, is the prototypical ‘all-road’ gravel bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Is it a gravel bike or a modern take on the classic endurance bike?

Think long front centre and a slacker head angle, combined with a short stem. It makes these bikes capable on descents and keeps the steering playful when the going gets technical.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, they perhaps won’t climb with the prowess of a race, all-road or adventure gravel bike, but you’ll make up the time when the trail tips back downhill.</p>\n<p>This category shows some of the most ‘extreme’ designs that drift a long way into mountain bike design territory.
