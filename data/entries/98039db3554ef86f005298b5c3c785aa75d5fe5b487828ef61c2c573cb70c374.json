Now, initial sales reports suggest there's still a substantial portion of the console market that's willing to shell out serious money for top-of-the-line console graphics.</p>\n<p>Circana analyst Matt Piscatella <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dap62o\">shared on Bluesky this morning</a> that the PS5 Pro accounted for a full 19 percent of US PS5 sales in its launch month of November. That sales ratio puts initial upgrade interest in the PS5 Pro roughly in line with <em>lifetime</em> interest in the PS4 Pro, which <a href=\"https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1834785622541975897\">recent reports suggest</a> was responsible for about 20 percent of all PS4 sales <a href=\"https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1834878244509647327\">following its launch</a> in 2016.</p>\n<p>That US sales ratio also lines up with international sales reports for the PS5 Pro launch. In the UK, GfK ChartTrack <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/black-friday-video-game-sales-dip-in-the-uk-uk-monthly-charts\">reports</a> that the PS5 Pro was responsible for 26 percent of all console sales for November. And in Japan, Famitsu sales data suggests the PS5 Pro was responsible for a full 63 percent of the PS5's November sales after <a href=\"https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/famitsu-sales-11-4-24-11-10-24\">selling an impressive 78,000 units in its launch week alone</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98039db3554ef86f005298b5c3c785aa75d5fe5b487828ef61c2c573cb70c374","category":"Tech"}
