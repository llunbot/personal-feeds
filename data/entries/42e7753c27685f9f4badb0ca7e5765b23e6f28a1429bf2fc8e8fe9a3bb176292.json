The upcoming Atari GameStation Go sets itself apart with what we're relatively sure is a first for portable gaming: built-in trackball, spinner, and number pad controls.</p>\n<p>Gamers who cut their teeth after 1990 or so might not remember an era when arcade and home console games often relied on controls that went beyond the usual D-pad/joystick and action buttons. But there are plenty of classics from the early days of electronic gaming that just don't feel right unless you have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trackball_arcade_games\">trackball</a> (<em>Centipede</em>, <em>Missile Command, Crystal Castles</em>), <a href=\"https://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php?topic=20283.0\">spinner</a> (<em>Arkanoid</em>, <em>Tempest</em>), or <a href=\"https://forums.atariage.com/topic/22808-what-other-games-use-the-keypad/\">number pad</a> (<em>Star Raiders</em>, Intellivision sports games). Many modern retro re-releases try to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/the-103-classic-games-that-did-and-didnt-make-the-atari-50-anniversary-cut/\">re-create these kinds of games with more standardized joystick and button controls</a>, but the results can be limited at best and unplayable at worst.</p>\n<p>The Atari GameStation Go, on the other hand, seems to be aiming for maximum retro authenticity by packing a whole host of control options into its $150, 7-inch display portable. While a prototype shell for the GameStation Go was <a href=\"https://armchairarcade.com/perspectives/2024/01/09/my-arcade-2024-line-of-atari-devices/\">briefly shown at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show</a> a year ago, this year's CES is <a href=\"https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/MY-ARCADE-announces-new-ATARI-GAMESTATION-collection\">the official announcement party</a> for a playable version of the GameStation Go.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/of-course-ataris-new-handheld-includes-a-trackball-spinner-and-numpad/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/of-course-ataris-new-handheld-includes-a-trackball-spinner-and-numpad/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"42e7753c27685f9f4badb0ca7e5765b23e6f28a1429bf2fc8e8fe9a3bb176292","category":"Tech"}
