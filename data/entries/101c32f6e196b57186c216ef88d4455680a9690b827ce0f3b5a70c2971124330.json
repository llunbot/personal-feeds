Today, Apple revealed its plans for the first refresh to the device. It's calling the new device the \"Apple Watch Ultra 2.\"</p>\n<p>The Ultra 2 has the same new S9 chip as the cheaper<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/new-apple-watch-series-9-improves-siri-processing-iphone-finding-and-more/\"> Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the same new \"double tap\" feature, which lets you tap your fingers together to trigger an action on the watch. There's a new display that hits a whopping 3,000 nits, a jump over even the 2,000 nits in the Series 9. There's also a new \"modular ultra\" watchface that uses the edge of the display, support for Bluetooth cycling accessories, and ANT+ support.</p>\n<p>The battery is the same as last time, hitting 36 hours on a single charge and 72 hours in low-power mode.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967598#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967598&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"101c32f6e196b57186c216ef88d4455680a9690b827ce0f3b5a70c2971124330","category":"Tech"}
