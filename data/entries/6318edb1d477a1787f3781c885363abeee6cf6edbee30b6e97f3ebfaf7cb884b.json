Today, it expanded on that practice with a new ad format that looks to sell things to Reddit users. Simultaneously, Reddit has marketers who are interested in pushing products to users through seemingly legitimate accounts.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/expanding-our-shopping-ecosystem-introducing-dynamic-product-ads\">blog post</a> today, Reddit announced that its Dynamic Product Ads are entering public beta globally. The ad format uses \"shopping signals,\" aka discussions with people looking to try a product or brand, machine learning, and advertiser product catalogs in order to post relevant ads. Reddit shared an image in the blog post that shows ads, including with products and pricing, that seem to relate to a posted question. User responses to the Reddit post appear under the ad.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Untitled-980x629.jpg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            A somewhat blurry depiction of the new type of ads Reddit is testing.
