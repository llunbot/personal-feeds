{"title":"Reuters: U.S. State Department Employees‚Äô iPhones Were Hacked With NSO Group Spyware","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-us-state-department-phones-hacked-with-israeli-company-spyware-sources-2021-12-03/","date":1638584924000,"content":"\n<p>Christopher Bing and Joseph Mann, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>iPhones of at least nine U.S. State Department employees were hacked by an unknown assailant using sophisticated spyware developed by the Israel-based NSO Group, according to four people familiar with the matter. The hacks, which took place in the last several months, hit U.S. officials either based in Uganda or focused on matters concerning the East African country, two of the sources said. [‚Ä¶]</p>\n\n<p>Apple‚Äôs alert to affected users did not name the creator of the spyware used in this hack. The victims notified by Apple included American citizens and were easily identifiable as U.S. government employees because they associated email addresses ending in state.gov with their Apple IDs, two of the people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fascinating to consider that the U.S. State Department is only aware of this hack because Apple notified the affected employees. That‚Äôs certainly how this report reads.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a public response, NSO has said its technology helps stop terrorism and that they‚Äôve installed controls to curb spying against innocent targets. For example, NSO says its intrusion system cannot work on phones with U.S. numbers beginning with the country code +1. But in the Uganda case, the targeted State Department employees were using iPhones registered with foreign telephone numbers, said two of the sources, without the U.S. country code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Big-time ‚úäüçÜ feel to this. Like hearing about PC malware that bypasses PCs with Russian keyboards attached.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/03/us-state-dept-iphones-nso-group\">¬†‚òÖ¬†</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"28da73e0ea6da11fae6e74bab5668bd65b0f472aec47296acb74dac193132b00","category":"Tech"}
