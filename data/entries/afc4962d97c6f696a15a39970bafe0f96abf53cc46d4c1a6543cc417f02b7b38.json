The story goes that the people on the remote island chopped down all the trees to build massive stone statues, triggering a population collapse. Their numbers were further depleted when Europeans discovered the island and brought foreign diseases, among other factors. But an alternative narrative began to emerge in the 21st century that the earliest inhabitants actually lived quite sustainably until that point. A <a href=\"http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado1459\">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances offers another key piece of evidence in support of that alternative hypothesis.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/new-study-challenges-popular-collapse-hypothesis-for-easter-island/\">previously reported</a>, Easter Island is famous for its giant monumental statues, called <em>moai</em>, built some 800 years ago and typically mounted on platforms called <em>ahu</em>. Scholars have puzzled over the <em>moai</em> on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island\">Easter Island</a> for decades, pondering their cultural significance, as well as how a Stone Age culture managed to carve <a href=\"https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120622-easter-island-statues-moved-hunt-lipo-science-rocked/\">and transport statues </a>weighing as much as 92 tons. The first Europeans arrived in the 17th century and found only a few thousand inhabitants on a tiny island (just 14 by 7 miles across) thousands of miles away from any other land. Since then, in order to explain the presence of so many <em>moai</em>, the assumption has been that the island was once home to tens of thousands of people<em>.</em></p>\n<p>But perhaps they didn't need tens of thousands of people to accomplish that feat. Back in 2012, Carl Lipo of Binghamton University and Terry Hunt of the University of Arizona <a href=\"https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120622-easter-island-statues-moved-hunt-lipo-science-rocked/\">showed that</a> you <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312004311?via%3Dihub\">could transport</a> a 10-foot, 5-ton <em>moai</em> a few hundred yards with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/easter-island-statues-walked-out-of-quarry-1.11613\">just 18 people</a> and three strong ropes by employing a rocking motion. In 2018, Lipo proposed <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/ingenious-technique-explains-how-easter-island-statues-1826568241\">an intriguing hypothesis</a> for how the islanders placed red hats on top of some <em>moai</em>; those can weigh up to 13 tons. He suggested the inhabitants <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544031830195X\">used ropes to roll</a> the hats up a ramp. Lipo and his team later concluded (based on quantitative spatial modeling) that the islanders likely chose the statues' locations based on the availability of fresh water sources, per a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210409\">2019 paper</a> in PLOS One.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031900#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031900&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"afc4962d97c6f696a15a39970bafe0f96abf53cc46d4c1a6543cc417f02b7b38","category":"Tech"}
