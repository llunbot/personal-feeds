Psyche is the largest metal-rich asteroid in the Solar System, with an average diameter of around 140 miles (226 kilometers). Observations from Earth indicate it's made mostly of nickel and iron.</p>\n<p>The Psyche mission will be the first to explore a metal-rich asteroid, which may be the leftover core of a proto-planet that began forming in the early Solar System more than 4 billion years ago.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960414#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960414&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f5f3a37d7cae05c83f16d3e6cbbaa4acb8c9cac834b33ed5056e00801092f19","category":"Tech"}
