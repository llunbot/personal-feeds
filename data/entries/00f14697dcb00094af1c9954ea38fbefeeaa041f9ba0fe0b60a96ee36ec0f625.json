But in a new update today, Apple also announced that it is making the self-repair process slightly less onerous.</p>\n<p>The company <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-expands-self-service-repair-and-updates-system-configuration-process/\">will now provide</a> a \"postrepair software tool\" called System Configuration that will handle the process of verifying that repairs were done properly, calibrating and updating the firmware of any replaced components and pairing TouchID and FaceID sensors with the device's Secure Enclave.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, these steps required a call to Apple's Self Service Repair support team, which would run users through finishing the repair process. Apple says its team will still be on standby if home repairers need help.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948950#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948950&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00f14697dcb00094af1c9954ea38fbefeeaa041f9ba0fe0b60a96ee36ec0f625","category":"Tech"}
