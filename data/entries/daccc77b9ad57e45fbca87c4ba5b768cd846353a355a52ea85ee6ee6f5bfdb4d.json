The public beta comes two days after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-beta-1/\">the first developer beta</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg\" width=\"2336\" height=\"1314\" />\r<br />\nBeta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com\">beta testing website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sonoma‌ 14.3 includes support for collaborative playlists in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, allowing ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers to build playlists with others. When creating a new playlist or selecting an existing playlist, there's a person-shaped icon that can be tapped to turn on collaboration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEnabling collaboration provides a link that can be shared with others, and anyone with the link is able to contribute to the playlist and listen to the songs. The person who started the playlist can choose to approve those who want to join or open it up to everyone. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sonoma‌ 14.3 is expected to see a launch at some point in January 2024.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-1/\">Apple Seeds First Public Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.3</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-3.2413743/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"daccc77b9ad57e45fbca87c4ba5b768cd846353a355a52ea85ee6ee6f5bfdb4d","category":"Apple"}
