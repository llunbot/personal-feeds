The speaker got an upgrade in 2015 with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/07/apple-debuts-beats-pill-plus-speaker/\">launch of the Pill+</a> under Apple's ownership, but over time it appeared to become an afterthought for Beats compared to headphones and earphones, and the Pill+ was eventually <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/\">discontinued in early 2022</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nAfter <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/\">several months of teasing</a>, Beats is officially announcing the <a href=\"https://www.beatsbydre.com/speakers/beats-pill\">return of the Beats Pill</a> today with a host of upgrades and a lower price point of $149.99. The new Pill features a completely redesigned speaker system consisting of a single tweeter and a single racetrack woofer, a removable lanyard, USB-C and Bluetooth connectivity, 24 hours of battery life, and IP67 water and sweat resistance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAvailable in Matte Black, Champagne Gold, and Statement Red color options, the new Beats Pill features a soft-touch silicone housing with a metal speaker grille and a Beats \"b\" logo, with several subtle physical buttons along the top for on-device controls. The new removable lanyard slips easily around the wrist to help secure it while being carried or even to let the speaker dangle from, although it can't be tightened up for additional security.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-pill-1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nCompared to the previous Pill+, the reengineered single racetrack woofer in the Beats Pill uses stronger neodymium magnets to drive 28% more motor force, allowing the woofer to displace 90% more air volume, while radial ribbing around the edges minimizes low-end distortion. The new Pill also moves from dual tweeters to a redesigned single tweeter in its own housing for extra stability and to similarly reduce distortion. Both speakers are aligned to give the Pill a 20º inclined tilt, which provides better sound projection with less reflected sound.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you have two Beats Pill speakers, you can pair them up in either Amplify Mode, which gives you bigger overall sound for larger spaces, or Stereo Mode, which separates the sound output into left and right channels sent to the different speakers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-pill-2.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe Beats Pill can serve as a speakerphone for your connected devices, with a noise-learning algorithm that suppresses ambient sound to target the user's voice, and full duplex support helps ensure your conversations are intelligible to both sides. Voice assistant support for connected devices is also include, so you can activate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> or Google Assistant with the press of a button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUSB-C comes to the Beats Pill for the first time, allowing for lossless audio over a wired connection, easy recharging, and the ability to charge other devices from the Pill's internal battery. The Pill itself has up to 24 hours of battery life, and a 10-minute Fast Fuel delivers up to two hours of playback. A black USB-C to USB-C cable is included in the box.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-pill-3.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe new Pill has four buttons along the top edge, a Power button, a Center button, and Volume Up/Down buttons. Each of the buttons serves multiple purposes, so you can control a fair amount of features without needing to dig into your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. A press of the Power button turns the speaker on or off, while a brief tap lights up an adjacent LED for battery status, a double tap activates ‌Siri‌, and a triple tap reverses the charging direction when connected via USB-C. Pressing and holding the Power button while plugging the Pill in via USB-C activates wired audio input.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Center button is for your usual media controls, with a single press playing or pausing your audio, a double press skipping forward, and a triple press skipping backward. The Center button is also used in combination with the Volume Up/Down buttons to configure the paired speaker modes. Holding the Center buttons on two speakers activates Amplify Mode, and holding Center and Volume Up on one of them then activates Stereo Mode with that speaker becoming the left channel. The same combination returns to Amplify Mode or holding Center and Volume Down can be used to break the speaker group entirely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA proprietary chip platform from Beats offers seamless access across both Apple and Android platforms, with one-touch pairing, automatic setup across all devices connected to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> or Google account, and support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> and ‌Find My‌ Device tracking based on the speaker's last connected location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-pill-4.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe new Pill does have some heft, weighing in at 24 ounces (~680 grams), although that is 10% lighter than the Pill+. It measures a little over 8.5 inches (~22 cm) long by 2.8 inches (~7 cm) deep and high, just fractionally larger than the Pill+. It's certainly portable and you can easily toss it in a bag, but you're not going to want to carry it in your hand wherever you go.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.beatsbydre.com/speakers/beats-pill\">revamped Beats Pill</a> is priced at $149.99 and is available to order today in all three colors, with shipping beginning this Thursday, June 27.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/\">Beats Pill Bluetooth Speaker Makes a Comeback With Improved Sound, Water Resistance, and a Lower Price Tag</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-makes-a-comeback-with-improved-sound-water-resistance-and-a-lower-price-tag.2430052/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1298593677cc54c9785f16e37fd5affd67896a854d555c4aecbd22f90e0b0dc1","category":"Apple"}
