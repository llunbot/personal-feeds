Moots pioneered some of the earliest mountain bikes that date back to the very early years of the 80’s. Right here in our remote corner of Colorado the first Moots mountain bikes were made in 1983 for use on local game trails and hiking trails. <span></span>They served as an exploration tool and a way to get from town into the deep forests that surround our area. Most of those early years mountain bike rides had a lot of hiking involved as the trails and double track were largely underdeveloped. Thank goodness for trail clubs and our local “trail fairies” as we call them, that maintain and develop trails that are a much better experience than those early days of riding offroad.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TMB_45_front_drive_trophy_1-3-3-copy-1024x698.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"545\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TMB_45_front_drive_trophy_1-3-3-copy-1024x698.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TMB_45_front_drive_trophy_1-3-3-copy-300x205.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TMB_45_front_drive_trophy_1-3-3-copy-768x524.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TMB_45_front_drive_trophy_1-3-3-copy.jpg 1230w\" /></p>\n<p>Moots has supported our local IMBA Chapter (The Routt County Riders) since it’s inception in the early 90’s. In turn Moots has also supported IMBA on a larger scale and back in 2013 we built the famous “Trail Maintenance Bike”, which went on to win best theme bike of show at the 2013 North American Handmade Bicycle Show in Denver Colorado. The concept of this unique bike was to be able to ride a trail and carry the tools needed. On the bike we incorporated a titanium rack to carry a chainsaw, hand tools, fuel and room for a trail beverage or two. Once done at the show it made its way around the country to trail clubs to help accomplish trail maintenance and development for all to enjoy.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0063-copy-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0063-copy-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0063-copy-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0063-copy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0063-copy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0063-copy.jpeg 1920w\" /></p>\n<p>ENVE came through with the bar &amp; rims.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2024 and we are teaming up with IMBA again to offer a custom Moots Womble that bears our variety of logos that have graced our bikes over the years. A true one-off anodized master piece. The full build will go to one lucky winner and with the help of top shelf brands like; 5DEV, SRAM, ROCK SHOX, CHRIS KING, ENVE and WTB we were able to bring this all together in order to raise funds to continue the push for trail development and access for all.</p>\n<p>To help IMBA reach the goal, we have built out this one of a kind Womble that features an homage to our logos from our 43 year history. Adorned with our our standard headbadge that gives a nod to our home town of Steamboat Springs. Our script logo that started it all in 1981 that is featured on the downtube with variations of our beloved Mr. Moots roaming the rest of the frame. Our finish team took it a couple steps further and added custom anodizing work to the 5Dev titanium stem and crank set.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0084-copy-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0084-copy-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0084-copy-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0084-copy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0084-copy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0084-copy.jpeg 1920w\" /></p>\n<p>ROCK SHOX, ENVE &amp; WTB providing the best.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0028-copy-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0028-copy-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0028-copy-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0028-copy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0028-copy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0028-copy.jpeg 1920w\" /></p>\n<p>The Moots finish crew went to town on the touches on the frame and 5DEV stem, crank and pedals.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0037-copy-1024x715.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"559\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0037-copy-1024x715.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0037-copy-300x209.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0037-copy-768x536.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0037-copy-1536x1072.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0037-copy.jpeg 1920w\" /></p>\n<p>Who doesn’t like more TITANIUM?</p>\n<p>We are calling on all riders, on-road or offroad to get in on this and help keep the momentum going for better trails and access.</p>\n<p><span>Create More Trails Close to Home, Win a Custom Moots Womble</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0082-copy-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0082-copy-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0082-copy-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0082-copy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0082-copy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0082-copy.jpeg 1920w\" /></p>\n<p>WTB and Mr. Moots…..like peanut butter &amp; jelly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span>Every mountain biker wins when they enter to win this custom Moots Womble.
