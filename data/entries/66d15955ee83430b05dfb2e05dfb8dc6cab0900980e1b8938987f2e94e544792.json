With the shop well known for providing expert advice and impeccable customer service, and being situated within riding distance of some of the nation’s finest roads, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclist sat down with Pinarello retail stores manager (and ex-World Championships-level racer) Margaret Herety to find out what makes the <a href=\"https://www.pinarellostore.co.uk/locations/wilmslow/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinarello store in Wilmslow</a> such a must-visit destination…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The ideal location</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’re located in the heart of Cheshire’s “golden triangle”, a sought-after area that’s home to many domestic and WorldTour professionals,’ Herety tells us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘From the shop, you can ride out to some beautiful lanes, get out onto the Cheshire plains to ride on the flat, or – because we’re right on the edge of the Peaks – you can also find more challenging routes. Wilmslow is quite a hub for cycling, and there are lots of clubs.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We host rides from the shop that everyone can join. Saturday’s is a “no drop” ride. We’re trying to build on the fantastic cycling community we have up here. We make sure everybody’s welcome – you don’t even need to ride a Pinarello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We had a new guy come and join us this week and when he got back to the shop afterwards for coffee and doughnuts, he was just so happy; he told us we’d really made him feel welcome and said he’d be coming again. We also had our first women-only ride at the beginning of June.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Broaden your horizons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People sometimes look at a Pinarello store and assume that everything will be expensive. I recently spoke with a customer in the store who said he couldn’t afford anything, and he was really surprised when I told him the endurance geometry X-series starts at around £3,000.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello Wilmslow\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/pinarello-145-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We’re a friendly bunch. We won’t bite your head off and we don’t treat anybody any differently, whether they come in wearing an Armani suit or work boots and a hi-viz jacket. Because we attract a range of customers, we sell a much broader range of bikes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Universal service</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Although we’re Pinarello specialists, we will service almost anything. We’ll look after anybody who walks in off the street. A woman came in the other day who’d been out for a ride with her little boy when his gears stopped working. We fixed it on the spot and he was over the moon to get his bike back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We also offer a bespoke building service for Pinarello Dogma models. You can choose your own colour and build a bike from scratch – the wheels, the groupset, pretty much anything on the bike can be specified. Plus we offer a bike-sizing service, where our in-store expert will make sure you have the correct frame size, saddle height and handlebar and stem size.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Women lead the way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was basically born on a bike – my grandad started my family’s own bike shop more than 100 years ago – so to be leading the Pinarello team at Wilmslow is really rewarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We have a young salesman on the team, for instance, and I love seeing how he’s flourished, and I love seeing the workshop get so busy. I’m so proud of how they’ve all done – and how passionate they are about cycling. And I’m also proud of how the shop looks – people are blown away when they walk through the door.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.pinarellostore.co.uk/locations/wilmslow/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to find out more about the Pinarello Wilmslow store</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-focus-wilmslow\">Pinarello focus: Wilmslow</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"66d15955ee83430b05dfb2e05dfb8dc6cab0900980e1b8938987f2e94e544792","category":"Cycling"}
