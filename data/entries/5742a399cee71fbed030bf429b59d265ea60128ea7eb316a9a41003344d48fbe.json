However, with the arrival of computers in the mid-twentieth century, translation technology began taking shape. Over the years, significant milestones have marked the evolution, shaping how translations are performed and enhancing the capabilities of language professionals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/modern-technology-future-language-translation/translation-phone-operator.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>Georgetown University and IBM conducted the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown%E2%80%93IBM_experiment\">Georgetown-IBM experiment</a> in the 1950s. The experiment was designed primarily to capture governmental and public interests and funding by demonstrating machine translation capabilities. It was far from a fully featured system. This early system, however, was rule-based and lexicographical, resulting in low reliability and slow translation speeds. Despite its weaknesses, it laid the foundation for future advancements in the field.</p>\n<p>The late 1980s and early 1990s marked the rise of <strong>statistical machine translation (SMT)</strong> pioneered by IBM researchers. By leveraging bilingual corpora, SMT improved translation accuracy and laid the groundwork for more advanced translation techniques.</p>\n<p>In the early 1990s, commercial <strong>computer-assisted translation (CAT)</strong> tools became widely available, empowering translators and boosting productivity. These tools utilized translation memories, glossaries, and other resources to support the translation process and enhance efficiency.</p>\n<p>The late 1990s saw IBM release a <a href=\"https://www.infoamerica.org/documentos_pdf/bar05.pdf\">rule-based statistical translation engine</a> (pdf), which became the industry standard heading into the new century. IBM’s translation engine introduced predictive algorithms and statistical translation, bringing machine translation to the forefront of language translation technology.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, the first <strong>cloud-based translation management systems (TMS)</strong> began appearing in the market. While there were some early non-cloud-based versions in the mid-1980s, these modern systems transformed the translation process by allowing teams of people to work more flexibly and collaborate with other company members regardless of their location. The cloud-based approach improved accessibility, scalability, and collaboration capabilities, completely changing how translation projects were managed.</p>\n<p>2006 is a significant milestone in translation management because it <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/translate/ten-years-of-google-translate/\">marks the launch</a> of <strong>Google Translate</strong>.

Human\n<p>Finding the proper translation approach involves weighing the benefits and drawbacks of machine translation (MT) and human translation. Each approach has its own strengths and considerations to take into account.</p>\n<p>Human translation, performed by professional linguists and subject-matter experts, offers accuracy, particularly for complex documents like legal and technical content. Humans can grasp linguistic intricacies and apply their own experiences and instincts to deliver high-quality translations. They can break down a language, ensure cultural nuances are correctly understood, and inject creativity to make the content compelling.</p>\n<p>Collaborating with <strong>human translators</strong> allows direct communication, reducing the chances of missing project objectives and minimizing the need for revisions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/modern-technology-future-language-translation/transltion-butting-heads.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>That said, human translation does have some downsides, namely that it is <strong>resource-intensive</strong> and <strong>time-consuming</strong> compared to machine translation. If you have ever worked on a multilingual project, then you understand the costs associated with human translation — not every team has a resident translator, and finding one for a particular project can be extremely difficult. The costs often run high, and the process may not align with tight timelines or projects that prioritize speed over contextual accuracy.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when it comes to localization and capturing the essence of messaging for a specific target audience, human translators excel in fine-tuning the content to resonate deeply. Machine translation cannot replicate the nuanced touch that human translators bring to the table.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>machine translation</strong> — powered by artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms — is rapidly improving its understanding of context and cultural nuances. Machine translation offers speed and cost-efficiency compared to that manual translations, making it suitable for certain projects that prioritize quick turnarounds and where contextual accuracy is not the primary concern.</p>\n<p>Modern TMSs often integrate machine and human translation capabilities, allowing users to choose the most appropriate approach for their specific requirements. Combining human translators with machine translation tools can create a powerful translation workflow. Machine translation can be used as a starting point and paired with human post-editing to ensure linguistic precision, cultural adaptation, and overall quality.</p>\n<p>Translation management systems often provide options for leveraging both approaches, allowing for flexibility and optimization based on the content, time constraints, budget, and desired outcome. Ultimately, finding the proper translation approach depends on the content’s nature, the desired accuracy level, project objectives, budget considerations, and time constraints. Assessing these factors and considering the advantages and disadvantages of human and machine translation will guide you in making informed decisions that align with your or your team’s needs and goals.</p>\nAI and Machine Translation\n<p>Thanks to machine learning and AI advancements, translation technology has come a long way in recent years.
