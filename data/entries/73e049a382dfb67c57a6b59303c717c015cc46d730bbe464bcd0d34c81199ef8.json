Its origins lie in the sometimes-obsessive fixations of competitive cyclists, who even back in the 1940s wanted all their equipment to be as light as possible. In an attempt to stop racers taking hacksaws and knives to our finely crafted products, we introduced her ancestor called B17 Competition in the 1950s. It had chamfered edges and no bag loops, to keep weight down, and solid steel rivets.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1418\" height=\"844\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/4-standard_professional_antique.jpg?fit=1200,844&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/4-standard_professional_antique.jpg?w=1418&amp;quality=75 1418w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/4-standard_professional_antique.jpg?resize=1200,714&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/4-standard_professional_antique.jpg?resize=768,457&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>That saddle evolved into the Standard Professional we bring back today, which features an exclusive hand-chamfered nose along with copper rivets that first appeared between the late 1960s and early ’70s.</p>\n<p>Now available in limited quantities through the <a href=\"https://www.brooksengland.com/en_us/standard-professional.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brooks online shop</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/brooks-professional-saddle/\">Brooks Reissues the Standard Professional Saddle</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"73e049a382dfb67c57a6b59303c717c015cc46d730bbe464bcd0d34c81199ef8","category":"Cycling"}
