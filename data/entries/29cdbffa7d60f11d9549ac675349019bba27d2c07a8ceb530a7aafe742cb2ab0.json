It will eventually encompass 50,000 miles of routes and open new opportunities for cross-country travel, regional touring, and commuting by bike. It also benefits communities by providing new bicycle routes, enhancing safety, and increasing tourism and economic activity.</p>\n<p>The newest routes are USBR 37 in Indiana, USBR 51 in Missouri, and two routes in Kansas: USBR 50 and USBR 55. The 2024 year added 3568 miles to the system, when the routes added in <a href=\"https://www.adventurecycling.org/member_news/new-usbrs-annoucements-for-spring-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">spring</a> are taken into account. This is the most of any year and brings the total milage to 23,186.</p>\n<p>“State DOTs are focused on delivering a safe, multimodal transportation system that offers mobility for all,” said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “Our partnership with the Adventure Cycling Association to continually expand the U.S Bicycle Route System is just one of the many ways states are meeting that goal. The four new routes being added to the USBRS network in Indiana, Kansas, and Missouri further highlight the active transportation benefits that flow from the partnership between AASHTO, state DOTs, and Adventure Cycling.”</p>\n<h3>New Routes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adventurecycling.org/member_news/new-usbrs-annoucements-for-spring-2024/#:~:text=Arkansas%20%E2%80%94%20NEW%20Route\" target=\"_blank\">Arkansas — NEW Route</a></p>\n<p>USBR 51 in Arkansas goes 88 miles from the Missouri state line to Alma, Arkansas (with eventual plans to connect to the Louisiana border).
