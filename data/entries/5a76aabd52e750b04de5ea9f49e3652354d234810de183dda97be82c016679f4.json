The High Coast Foldsack 24 simply closes with a zip and when the lid is folded down, the zip is protected from the rain. A hook is used to latch the lid closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sewn loops on the backpack allow the metal hook to be hooked into seven positions. However, the hook easily slips out of the loops, especially when lightly loaded. We didn’t use the hook on the way to the gym, so there was enough room for a full set of tennis equipment including rackets. The handle peeked out of the zip, which was not fully closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Foldsack is very flat and can therefore be easily stowed in a suitcase. This means that the volume can be adjusted very flexibly, with the High Coast Foldsack holding a maximum of 24 liters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interior of the Foldsack is minimalist, with a laptop compartment measuring 17-by-9.8 inches (43-by-25 centimeters) and a zipped compartment with a key hook for a power supply unit and cable. On the outside, there is a large compartment with a zip on the front and two side pockets for a water bottle and umbrella.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Fjallraven_HighCoastFoldsack24_01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Fjallraven_HighCoastFoldsack24_03.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fjällräven’s origins as an outdoor specialist can be seen in the straps, material, and workmanship. There are straps on the sides to secure the contents in the side pockets, and the backpack has a removable lap belt and an adjustable chest strap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The material is waterproof 100 percent recycled nylon with a contrasting, extra-durable bottom made of mountain shell material. The workmanship is commensurate with the price the backpack and promises a long service life. The is PFC-free and has been produced under fair working conditions. The fact that the rucksack is not 100 percent rainproof is due to the zips, which are not specially sealed. The dark-colored base with its hard-wearing material is very well thought out. This is particularly important for the bright colors, as dirt is more noticeable and less easy to remove.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The High Coast Foldsack 24 is a backpack that is fun to use. This is partly due to the many fresh and modern colors, but also to the wide range of uses. However, you also have to consider its limits. The High Coast Foldsack 24 is very light, which makes it ideal for leisure, sports, traveling, and shopping, but not as a laptop backpack–it lacks padding for a laptop. Only the back of the rucksack is padded for comfortable carrying.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/High_Coast_Foldsack_24_23222-560_J_DETAIL_FJR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/High_Coast_Foldsack_24_23222-560_I_DETAIL_FJR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/High_Coast_Foldsack_24_23222-560_K_DETAIL_FJR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/High_Coast_Foldsack_24_23222-560_H_DETAIL_FJR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Fjällräven High Coast Foldsack 24\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/High_Coast_Foldsack_24_23222-560_F_DETAIL_FJR.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/2245724/universal-rucksack-fjallraven-high-coast-foldsack-24-test.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2287234-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Macwelt</a> and was translated by </em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\"><em>Roman Loyola</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\nLaptop Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5a76aabd52e750b04de5ea9f49e3652354d234810de183dda97be82c016679f4","category":"Apple"}
