{"title":"Medium’s me.dm Mastodon Server Opens Up","link":"https://blog.medium.com/join-mastodon-with-medium-e2d6d814325b","date":1678157190000,"content":"\n<p>Alex Benzer, director of product at Medium:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A few weeks ago, we announced that <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/medium-embraces-mastodon-19dcb873eb11\">Medium is embracing short-form\nwriting</a> by launching our very own Mastodon server at\n<a href=\"https://me.dm/\">me.dm</a>. Starting today, we’re opening up me.dm access for\nour member community. If you’re a Medium member, you can <a href=\"https://medium.com/mastodon\">create\nan account on me.dm</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s fascinating to see Medium enter the Mastodon game. For one thing, amongst Medium’s co-founders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html\">are Ev Williams (who also served as Medium’s CEO for most of its existence) and Biz Stone</a> — two people who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/20/biz-stone-twitter\">at Twitter at the beginning</a>. Williams also served as one of Twitter’s numerous CEOs.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Medium is a commercial company, having raised, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medium\">according to CrunchBase</a>, $163 million (so far). To my knowledge no company with such resources has started a public Mastodon instance to date. I am very uncomfortable with the fact that nearly all Mastodon servers are free-to-use volunteer efforts, funded by voluntary donations. That’s not sustainable. I suspect a lot of Mastodon servers that seem to be thriving today won’t be around in 5 years, taking all of their posts with them. I don’t feel great about the fact that Medium is venture-backed, either, but they do charge $5/month or $50/year for a membership. I like paying for the services I use. Twitter is free to use and look how that’s gone.</p>\n\n<p>Third, “me.dm” is a cool-ass domain name. If I weren’t already all-in with my <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber\">@gruber@mastodon.social</a> account, I’d be tempted to start here. As every <a href=\"https://fields.medium.com/a-brief-introduction-to-mastodon-587f36b6ba20\">good introduction to Mastodon</a> makes clear, it’s confusing and tricky to choose which server to sign up on. Medium’s strikes me as a good one.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/06/medium-mastodon\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"5dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6df325375dbf863209d55780cc4142dcc4b41efbca6462438b4f89","category":"Tech"}
