There are no other changes to the HomePod mini beyond the new colors, and pricing remains $149 in Australia and $159 in New Zealand, including sales tax.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says the new colors will also be released in Austria, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the UK by the end of November, and indeed some of Apple's online stores in these regions are already taking orders, with shipping in the UK being offered as early as this Thursday and in-store pickup from Friday.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new colors can be ordered on Apple.com or using the Apple Store app in both Australia and New Zealand with a 1-3 business days shipping estimate. Apple Store pickup is also an option in Australia, but there are no Apple Store locations in New Zealand.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Ben Winter!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/22/homepod-mini-new-colors-orders-au-nz/\">New HomePod Mini Colors Now Available in Australia and New Zealand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-homepod-mini-colors-now-available-in-australia-and-new-zealand.2324535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6pZEp15z3hY:aBUNmAOzmUo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6pZEp15z3hY:aBUNmAOzmUo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d60d702474fb8cbc360ee964dda04ba253b8addfc874f4c4bb65dcb7672733d","category":"Apple"}
