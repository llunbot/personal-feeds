The app scans your device and intelligently finds duplicate photos, giant videos, forgotten screenshots, and low-quality shots you didn’t realize were multiplying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surprisingly helpful part? It doesn’t just delete — it suggests. AI highlights the best image in a group, compresses videos without wrecking quality, and can even convert Live Photos to standard shots to save serious space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything runs locally on your device, so your photos never leave your phone. No uploading, no weird privacy tradeoffs — <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/cleanmyphone-1-year-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12397&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=cleanmyphone-cleanup-storage-app-2026-02-17&amp;utm_term=SALE-329114\" target=\"_blank\">just a cleaner library</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also shows real-time storage analytics, so you finally understand why 40GB vanished overnight (spoiler: videos and memes).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of upgrading storage again, you might just clean it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because most phones don’t need replacing — they need organizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/cleanmyphone-1-year-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12397&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=cleanmyphone-cleanup-storage-app-2026-02-17&amp;utm_term=SALE-329114\" target=\"_blank\">CleanMy Phone for your iPhone or iPad</a> while it’s just $19.99 (MSRP $44.99).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp3.stackassets.com/84e381cf58f8ff2923996a44509476f0c640b6d5/store/7351f4ad3f4f92059a08c94a1cc7e5dde066a170548aa079676330d9a00e/sale_329114_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>CleanMy®Phone Cleanup Storage App<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/cleanmyphone-1-year-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12397&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=cleanmyphone-cleanup-storage-app&amp;utm_term=SALE-329114\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2dc7b4c56fa65042cc3253691dc20f02197439fbfa0aa2c198804fd5d82866c6","category":"Apple"}
