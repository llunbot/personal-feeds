We love our furry feline overlords despite the occasional hairball and their propensity to scratch the furniture to sharpen their claws. The latter is perfectly natural kitty behavior, but overly aggressive scratching is usually perceived as a behavioral problem. Veterinarians frown on taking extreme measures like declawing or even euthanizing such \"problematic\" cats. But there are alternative science-backed strategies for reducing or redirecting the scratching the behavior, according to the authors of a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2024.1403068/full\">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science.</p>\n<p>This latest study builds on the group's prior research investigating the effects of synthetic feline facial pheromones on undesirable scratching in cats, according to co-author Yasemin Salgirli Demirbas, a veterinary researcher at Ankara University in Turkey. \"From the beginning, our research team agreed that it was essential to explore broader factors that might exacerbate this issue, such as those influencing stress and, consequently, scratching behavior in cats,\" she told Ars. \"What’s new in this study is our focus on the individual, environmental and social dynamics affecting the level of scratching behavior. This perspective aims to enhance our understanding of how human and animal welfare are interconnected in different scenarios.\"</p>\n<p>The study investigated the behavior of 1,211 cats, with data collected via an online questionnaire completed by the cats' caregivers. The first section collected information about the caregivers, while the second asked about the cats' daily routines, social interactions, environments, behaviors, and temperaments. The third and final section gathered information about the frequency and intensity of undesirable scratching behavior in the cats based on a helpful \"scratching index.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034541#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034541&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c08246c783bef821f7d0180c3a8694de3392b75fdf42226859558134d27b630e","category":"Tech"}
