Microsoft is apparently aware of this behavior and is doing something about it: <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-says-its-own-edge-browser-is-more-trustworthy-than-so-2008-google-chrome/\">Neowin has spotted</a> new Edge pop-ups that specifically try to dissuade users from downloading and installing Chrome, a change that I promise I didn't know about when <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/edge-is-a-good-browser-but-microsofts-heavy-handed-tactics-make-it-hard-to-love/\">I wrote about Microsoft's annoying promotion of Microsoft Edge literally yesterday</a>.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/edge-popup.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/edge-popup-980x696.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/edge-popup.jpeg\">\"I still love this joke construction,\" said no one in the last half-decade.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813733/microsoft-windows-edge-download-chrome-prompts\">The Verge</a>)</p></div>\n<p>You won't see the pop-ups every time you try to download Chrome (I haven't yet), but Neowin and other outlets <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813733/microsoft-windows-edge-download-chrome-prompts\">like The Verge</a> have spotted at least three different messages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.\"</li>\n<li>\"'I hate saving money,' said no one ever. Microsoft Edge is the best browser for online shopping.\"</li>\n<li>\"That browser is so 2008! Do you know what's new? Microsoft Edge.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the operating system-level pop-ups are a small escalation in the ongoing browser wars, this kind of behavior isn't new. If you use Bing to search for essentially <em>any</em> web browser, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi, or Brave, a large ad for Edge appears both above the search results and in a giant box to the right of the search results. And whenever you log into Google's services using Edge or any other non-Chrome browser for the first time, you'll get a \"helpful\" nudge about downloading and installing Chrome. But as the provider of Windows, Microsoft definitely has more opportunities to suggest using Edge, and it takes advantage of those opportunities with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/edge-is-a-good-browser-but-microsofts-heavy-handed-tactics-make-it-hard-to-love/\">frustrating regularity</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817498\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817498&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"07778c4ea59affcf8b8152b6e0966d875a06ecffcc8b062920bfd60d136ec304","category":"Tech"}
