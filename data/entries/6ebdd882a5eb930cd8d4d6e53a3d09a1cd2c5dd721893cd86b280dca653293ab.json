(In fact, I’ve even taken some heat from a certain <em>Cyclist</em> staff member – let’s call him Mr Gill Crickson – for my choice of interconnected earbuds.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me, the JBL Soundgear Sense headphones are a sensible option, coming as they do with a stabilising headband to ensure runners and riders don’t dislodge a bud mid-flow. JBL is also responsible for the UE (Ultimate Ears) Boom line of portable speakers, of which I own a few, so there’s some good credit in the bank there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC01804-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with the current trend for bone conduction headphones, the JBLs rest over the ear canal so that you can hear your music or podcast, but also stay alert to dive-bombing birds of prey and the irascible bears and beasts that line the byways of Kent and Surrey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound is great – I don’t think Enya’s greatest hits have ever sounded better than they do now – and there’s a decent level of splashproofing, as well as a charge case that stashes an additional 18 hours on top of the 6-hour battery runtime. You can hook the headphones up to the JBL app too if you simply cannot stand to listen to Charlie Parker without the correct jazz EQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the JBL Soundgear Sense headphones from <a href=\"https://uk.jbl.com/wireless-earbuds/SOUNDGEAR-SENSE.html\" target=\"_blank\">JBL (£100.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gp-montreal-quebec-preview\">GP Québec and Montréal 2024: Canada one-day race routes, start lists and how to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/best-bikes-groupsets-wheels-pro-cycling-2024\">Which bike brands, groupsets and wheels won the most at Grand Tours in 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Tour of Britain 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Vuelta a España 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Quoc Lala Slide sliders</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/QUOCFFF-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>One hop this time</em>. Fittingly, I remember being on a school trip to the Somme when DJ Casper’s career-defining banger Cha Cha Slide was top of the charts. Most of the bus, in between inhaling Haribo-like oxygen and smelling categorically awful, spent the interminable coach journey replicating the dance routine in the aisle. (Woe betide the pre-pubescent pariah without access to the choreography.) Much fun and vomiting ensued, lest we forget DJ Casper. <em>CRISS CROSS!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps someone on Quoc’s branding team was on the same bus. The Lala Slide slider is said to be the ultimate post-ride slip-on thanks to an anatomically designed footbed complete with arch shaping. The footbed is certainly grippy and contoured, though I’ve taken to wearing them with socks to both channel my inner coxcomb and – let’s say – minimise their contamination by my actual feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/DSC02107-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The thick straps are made from the same microfiber as Quoc’s gravel shoes the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/quoc-gran-tourer-ii-review\" target=\"_blank\">Gran Tourers</a> and are available in four different colours.

I hadn’t actually heard of cobber until the Knog Blinder 1300 &amp; Mid Cobber lights arrived at the office. An informal term for a companion or friend so I’m told. Does the Gen Z ‘Mid’ part indicate that it’s kind of a mid-range friend? Who knows. Anyway, since it’s helping to keep me alive out there, it seems like an apt term for these lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, with the sheer range of aero handlebar shapes kicking around these days, to my mind, bike lights must come with enough fixtures to keep themselves relevant and practical. The Blinder arrived with a rubber strap that will stretch around a broadly diametered round bar. Though it would be handy if this was less specifically catered to purely round bars, worry not: it also comes with a GoPro-style attachment so that I can fit it to an out-front mount underneath my bike computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once installed, the Knog doesn’t do much wrong. The 1,300-lumen beam is more than I’ll ever need and will run for up to 120 hours on the eco flash mode. If it’s flashy in the front then it’s a 330-degree party in the back. There are practical benefits to this almost full circle visibility: when you look down between your legs you can clearly see whether the light is actually on or not. Simple but useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/KNOG3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This party might go on for days because the battery life for the rear light is also… bonzer? 100 hours and change. The attachment is more rudimentary – a range of three rubber bands – but they’ve catered for all three of the seatposts and tubes I’ve used this month so I can’t complain.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the Knog Blinder 1300 &amp; Mid Cobber Rear Bike Light Set from <a href=\"https://www.knog.com/products/blinder-1300-mid-cobber-rear-bike-light-set?srsltid=AfmBOopd7IY5VrZS8kUqZjh9LvqsG002DW-9jTBeAklzooXZE3wjh1xJ\" target=\"_blank\">Knog (£159.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Endura Hummvee Flat Pedal shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ENDURA1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The world of hybrid cycling and off-bike shoewear can be something of an ugly jungle. While it isn’t instantly clear what connection they have to Pimp My Ride-adjacent motor vehicles, the Hummvee Flat Pedal shoes are said to be bike-specific thanks to their StickyFoot Grip Rubber outsole and a Flex Profile, which complements both pedalling and walking.

The V2 keeps the one-of-a-kind mono-plate construction which made the original HOLLOWcage so popular over the last few years. It is also equipped with fully custom, ceramic jockey wheel bearings and our proven X-ring silencing technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve heard that the previous version was not ‘carbon enough’. So we worked tirelessly to source new materials while improving the mono-plate construction itself. The new mono-plate boasts a shiny finish that highlights the carbon fibre construction. It is now made from the very same material as used by SRAM in the Red eTap AXS derailleur cage. Our full ceramic bearings are independently certified using X-ray diffraction by Lucideon Ltd – a specialist in ceramics and materials science.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same type of material and manufacturing process (injection moulding) is used by SRAM to make the Red derailleur cage, by Shimano to make the Dura-Ace derailleur cage and by CeramicSpeed to make its cages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Buy the</em> HOLLOWcage Carbon<em> on the website:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://absoluteblack.cc/hollowcage-carbon-ceramic-oversized-derailleur-pulley-cage-9200\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>visit absoluteblack.cc</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature ends</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: Jessica Pratt</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1464\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-12-103839.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-12-103839.png 1464w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-12-103839-300x97.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-12-103839-970x312.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-12-103839-768x247.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-12-103839-750x241.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-12-103839-1140x367.png 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There aren’t many bands or singers that I will make the effort to go and see live. I try and consume all the major musical food groups in one weekend at the end of June, but occasionally there will be an artist who either isn’t on the Worthy Farm menu or is delicious enough to see twice. Folk singer Jessica Pratt is one such virtuoso.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her music is like listening to the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/21/a-meta-masterpiece-why-the-muppet-christmas-carol-is-the-perfect-festive-film\" target=\"_blank\">shout out to Muppet Christmas Carol</a>) serenading you with a series of joyous and torturous memories of a life surrendered to feeling. Luckily, I don’t have that many feelings, so she lets me know what it might be like to have absolutely loads of them – as well as having a burning urge to let everyone know what they are via a cripplingly beautiful medium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just about managed to get hold of some tickets to see her at the Barbican in November and I’m even missing my one-year-old’s birthday to do so (she will be asleep, it’s fine). It’s now sold out but if you ever get the chance, definitely give her a whirl. Start with her 2019 album Quiet Signs, and work your way across her soundscape of gut punches from there. You might not survive but it will have been worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6gfh7DsfwxpZkRcPZo75M1\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Pratt, <em>Quiet Signs</em></a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gp-montreal-quebec-preview\">GP Québec and Montréal 2024: Canada one-day race routes, start lists and how to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/best-bikes-groupsets-wheels-pro-cycling-2024\">Which bike brands, groupsets and wheels won the most at Grand Tours in 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Tour of Britain 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Vuelta a España 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/knog-blinder-lights\">In the Drops: JBL Soundgear Sense headphones, Quoc’s cha cha sliders, Knog Blinder light set, versatile Endura shoes and Jessica Pratt</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Laurence Kilpatrick &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6ebdd882a5eb930cd8d4d6e53a3d09a1cd2c5dd721893cd86b280dca653293ab","category":"Cycling"}
