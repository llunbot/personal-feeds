While the results can be impressive, the decompilation process can take years of painstaking manual effort, meaning only the most popular N64 games are likely to get the requisite attention from reverse engineers.</p>\n<p>Now, a newly released tool promises to vastly reduce the amount of human effort needed to get basic PC ports of most (if not all) N64 games. The <a href=\"https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp/tree/dev?tab=readme-ov-file\">N64 Recompiled project</a> uses a process known as <a href=\"https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/155511/why-is-static-recompilation-not-possible\">static recompilation</a> to automate huge swaths of the labor-intensive process of drawing C code out of N64 binaries.</p>\n<p>While human coding work is still needed to smooth out the edges, project lead Mr-Wiseguy told Ars that his recompilation tool is \"the difference between weeks of work and years of work\" when it comes to making a PC version of a classic N64 title. And parallel work on a powerful N64 graphic renderer means PC-enabled upgrades like smoother frame rates, resolution upscaling, and widescreen aspect ratios can be added with little effort.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025130#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025130&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0151537a5202bac45e291d63dbff21e3eac9c4dfc164de0f6b31866948847bfb","category":"Tech"}
