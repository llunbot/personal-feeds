Since 2016, the spacecraft has flown within a few thousand kilometers of Jupiter’s colorful cloud tops every 53 days, using a carefully selected array of instruments to peer deeper into the planet than ever before.</p>\n<p>The most recent findings from these measurements have now been published in a series of papers, revealing the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter’s weather systems—including of its famous Great Red Spot, a centuries-old storm big enough to swallow the Earth whole.</p>\n<p>Before Juno, decades of observations had revealed the famous striped appearance of Jupiter’s atmosphere, with white bands known as zones, and red-brown bands known as belts. The bands are separated by powerful winds zipping east and west, known as the jet streams, and are punctuated by gigantic vortices, such as the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/six-mysteries-of-jupiters-great-red-spot-80829\">red spot</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808837#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808837&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"653bb4ae23036a4d6096598d76627eeb46297a985568573ce41f5c91f91b072f","category":"Tech"}
