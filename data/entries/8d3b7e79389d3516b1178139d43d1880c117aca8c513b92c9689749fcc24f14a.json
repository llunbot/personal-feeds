For instance, in 2022, archaeologists excavated a 5,300-year-old skull of an elderly woman (about 65 years old) from a Spanish tomb. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-5300-year-old-skull-shows-evidence-of-the-earliest-known-ear-surgery/\">They determined</a> that seven cut marks near the left ear canal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06223-6.pdf?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=e52d4fa5ac9c11ed82a9e06b0a82b824\">were strong evidence</a> of a primitive surgical procedure to treat a middle ear infection. The team also identified a flint blade that may have been used as a cauterizing tool. By the 17th century, this was a fairly common procedure to treat acute ear infections, and skulls showing evidence of a mastoidectomy have been found in Croatia (11th century), Italy (18th and 19th centuries), and Copenhagen (19th or early 20th century). </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025113#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025113&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d3b7e79389d3516b1178139d43d1880c117aca8c513b92c9689749fcc24f14a","category":"Tech"}
