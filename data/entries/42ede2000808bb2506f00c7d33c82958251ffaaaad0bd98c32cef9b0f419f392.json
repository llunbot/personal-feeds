Now science fiction is on the verge of becoming science fact: Researchers from Cornell University have designed a prototype stillsuit for astronauts that will recycle their urine into potable water during spacewalks, according to a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frspt.2024.1391200/full\">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Space Technologies.</p>\n<p>Herbert provided specific details about the <a href=\"https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Stillsuit/DE\">stillsuit's design</a> when planetologist Liet Kynes explained the technology to Duke Leto Atreides I:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It's basically a micro-sandwich—a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system. The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body ... near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers ... include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt's reclaimed. Motions of the body, especially breathing and some osmotic action provide the pumping force. Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck... Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to ensure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day...</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Illustrated Dune Encyclopedia</em> interpreted the stillsuit as something akin to a hazmat suit, without the full face covering. In David Lynch's 1984 film, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(1984_film)\"><em>Dune</em></a>, the stillsuits were organic and very form-fitting compared to the book description, almost like a second skin. The stillsuits in Denis Villeneuve's most recent film adaptations (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(2021_film)\"><em>Dune Part 1</em></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Part_Two\"><em>Part 2</em></a>) tried to hew more closely to the source material, with \"micro-sandwiches\" of acrylic fibers and porous cottons and embedded tubes for better flexibility.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035963#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035963&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"42ede2000808bb2506f00c7d33c82958251ffaaaad0bd98c32cef9b0f419f392","category":"Tech"}
