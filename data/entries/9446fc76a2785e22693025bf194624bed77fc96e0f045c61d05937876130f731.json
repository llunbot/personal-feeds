Examples of this phenomenon include the second-generation iPod, which expanded compatibility beyond the Mac; the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/07/iphone3g-review/\">iPhone 3G</a> refresh that increased cellular data speeds and ushered in the App Store; the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/11/the-future-of-notebooks-ars-reviews-the-11-macbook-air/\">2010 MacBook Air refresh</a> that switched to all-SSD storage and defined the template for the modern laptop; and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/03/ipad-2-the-ars-review/\">the long-lived iPad 2</a>, which did most of the same things as the first iPad but in a much faster and lighter package.</p>\n<p>Apple is already working on a next-generation version of its Vision Pro headset to address early complaints about the as-yet-unreleased first-generation model, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-08/apple-plans-smaller-lighter-vision-headset-meta-works-on-cheaper-quest-3-ar-lnhh1ulx\">according to</a> Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The headset's roughly 1-pound weight has apparently \"caused neck strain\" among some testers, and Apple allegedly sees <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/apple-vision-pro-secondary-head-strap/\">the not-yet-finalized optional top strap</a> as an imperfect solution to the problem. Apple also wants to reduce the device's size along with its weight.</p>\n<p>Apple is also considering changing the way that prescription lenses are built into the headset. The initial version will use interchangeable Zeiss lenses that attach to the headset magnetically, but next-gen versions could have prescription lenses built-in during manufacturing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974442#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974442&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9446fc76a2785e22693025bf194624bed77fc96e0f045c61d05937876130f731","category":"Tech"}
