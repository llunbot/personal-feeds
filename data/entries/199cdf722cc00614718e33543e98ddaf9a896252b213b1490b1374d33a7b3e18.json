{"title":"Report: Apple Mail is getting automatic categories on iPadOS and macOS","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/report-apple-mail-is-getting-automatic-categories-on-ipados-and-macos/","date":1737412105000,"content":"<p>A report from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se\">Mark Gurman in Bloomberg</a> makes the very reasonable suggestion that automatic email categorization in Apple Mail, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/\">already present since iOS 18 arrived on the iPhone</a>, is coming to Macs and iPads in a few months. The feature should arrive with macOS 15.4 and possibly iPadOS 18.4, both due in April.</p>\n<p>Similar to Google's server-side Gmail sorting, which <a href=\"https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html\">debuted in May 2013</a>, Apple's Mail app on iOS sorts email into categories: \"Primary,\" \"Transactions,\" \"Updates,\" and \"Promotions.\" Moving an email manually from one category to another generally fixes the categorization for that sender from then on. You cannot create new categories, however, or alter how Apple's sorting functions.</p>\n<p>Some may prefer the simplicity of a single scroll of messages, versus having to check four separate inboxes to ensure that nothing got missorted or is more important than the label implies. I've used sorting on iOS and generally found it helpful, though I also use the Filters button in the lower-left corner on iOS to do a double-check of all the mail addressed specifically to me. On a Mac desktop, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/mimestream-the-ars-pick-for-mac-gmail-client-hits-1-0-with-new-features/\">I'm partial to Mimestream</a>, but that's because all my mail comes through Google/Workspace accounts. I'll be watching to see how Mail's sorting translates to macOS.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/report-apple-mail-is-getting-automatic-categories-on-ipados-and-macos/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/report-apple-mail-is-getting-automatic-categories-on-ipados-and-macos/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"199cdf722cc00614718e33543e98ddaf9a896252b213b1490b1374d33a7b3e18","category":"Tech"}
