{"title":"iPhone 16 Models Rumored to Add Dedicated ‘Capture Button’","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/","date":1703880781000,"content":"\n<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>MacRumors has shared multiple details <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/\">on the iPhone 16’s \ndesign</a>, including the unveiling of a new button that is \nplanned for the devices, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/\">the Capture Button</a>. While we’ve \nknown the name and location of the button, the internal \ninformation that we’ve obtained does not detail what it will be \nused for. </p>\n\n<p>According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Capture Button will be \nable to record video. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-17/apple-2024-plans-new-low-end-airpods-vision-pro-larger-iphone-16-oled-ipad-lq9jhed4\">this week’s Power On newsletter</a>, \nGurman says that the iPhone 16 models will include a “new \ndedicated button for taking video.” [...] </p>\n\n<p>The Capture button will be a capacitive button with haptic \nfeedback rather than a mechanical button, and it is expected to \ninclude a force sensor that can recognize pressure. The location \nof the button may make it easy to trigger, but if it is activated \nvia pressure, it could be that holding it down will launch into \nthe camera and allow video recording to start. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this comes true — and I hope it does — the button might default to shooting video, but I’d bet the house it will be configurable, like this year’s Action button. When using an iPhone as a camera, the main thing I miss from dedicated cameras is a hardware shutter button. With dedicated cameras, the shutter button can be pressed halfway to set exposure and focus, and only captures on a full press. A force-sensitive Capture button could work similarly.</p>\n\n<p>You can set the iPhone 15 Pro’s Action button to act as a shutter button for the Camera app, but it’s in the wrong location on the frame of the phone. I don’t want to press a shutter button with my left thumb, I want to press it with my right index finger. (You can orient the Action button to be on the top right by holding the iPhone horizontally with camera at the bottom, but that feels awkward to me.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/29/iphones-16-capture-button\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9fe4c762d22e9e87ddd7e24e79cd4cd3a31d18f895cf024a4ba13b65f1044fac","category":"Tech"}
