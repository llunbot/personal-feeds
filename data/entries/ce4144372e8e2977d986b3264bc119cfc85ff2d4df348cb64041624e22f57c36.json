Only Specialized managed that feat in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-bikes/\">men’s Tour de France</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the Tour de France Femmes includes several large brands without representation in the men’s field – Orbea (Ceratizit-WNT Pro Cycling Team) and Felt (Human Powered Health) are the two key examples.</p>\n<p>Dig about more and you’ll find plenty else to keep even BikeRadar’s dedicated tech sleuths entertained.</p>\n<p>From incredible custom paintjobs to off-sponsor tech choices, including a totally different bike brand in one case, the Tour de France Femmes is a rich seam of interesting tech.</p>\n<p>We were on the ground for the first two stages in and around Clermont-Ferrand to bring you the most interesting tech from the 2023 Tour de France Femmes.

is still a great groupset, but we didn’t expect to see it at the Tour de France Femmes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with Ultegra R8070 – other than a switch to 12-speed, an aesthetic update and some other small changes, the differences between the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-ultegra-r8170-di2-review/\">Ultegra Di2 R8170 groupset</a> and the older, 11-speed kit are minimal.</p>\n<p>Regardless, it’s still novel to see an older groupset being raced at such a high level.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The old groupset is paired with very

claimed weight of 1,255g, and are seen here with custom contrasting white Mavic decals.</p>\n<p>No corners have been cut for Tracey’s tyres either, with the Lifeplus–Wahoo rider running <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/continental-grand-prix-5000-s-tr-review/\">Continental’s highly rated GP5000 S TR</a> tubeless tyres.</p>\n<p>Tracey’s bike also marks a rare appearance for <a

striking road bikes.</p>\n<p>That’s especially true on smaller-sized versions, as evidenced here by Marie-Morgane Le Deunff’s bike.</p>\n<p>In a similar style to the <a

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-jersey-colours/\">yellow jersey</a> winner, Jonas Vingegaard), the Oltre RC uses a high-rise one-piece cockpit to increase the effective stack

eye-catching ‘<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/arkea-aamsic-bianchi-oltre-rc/\">air deflector wings</a>’, in order to comply with UCI regulations (specifically, article 1.2.034).</p>\n<div>\n

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/bianchi-specialissima-dura-ace-di2-review/\">Bianchi Specialissima</a> – a classic double-triangle road bike designed with climbing (and passione) in mind.</p>\n<p>Le Deunff opts for Shimano’s Dura-Ace C36 wheelset, shod with Continental Competition Pro Ltd tubular tyres – a tyre that used to be very popular among WorldTour pros, but has largely fallen out of favour in recent years (more on that later).</p>\n<h2>Ceratizit–WNT Pro Cycling ride the new Orbea Orca</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The new Orbea

The UCI says this will promote “fair and equitable access to equipment in cycling events… ensuring a level playing field for all competitors”.</p>\n<p>Approved equipment is marked with tamper-proof RFID stickers, with UCI commissaries checking bikes prior to each stage.</p>\n<p>Teams faced fines between CHF 5,000 and 100,000, or even outright disqualification, for non-compliance.</p>\n<p>Between this and enforcing stringent sock-height rules, the long arm of UCI ‘law’ reaches far into the world of cycling.
