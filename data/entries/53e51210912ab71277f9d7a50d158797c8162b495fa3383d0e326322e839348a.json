The Studio addresses many of the needs of the Mac Pro's intended audience in a smaller device that costs less money, while the Apple Silicon Mac Pro seems likely to dispense with at least some of the upgradeability and versatility of past generations.</p>\n\n<p>Reports have suggested that Apple <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/apple-could-skip-an-m2-mac-studio-update-to-boost-apple-silicon-mac-pro/\">could skip an M2-powered Mac Studio refresh</a> to make that planned Mac Pro more appealing to potential buyers when it arrives. But that doesn't mean the Mac Studio is going away; Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-16/apple-wwdc-2023-june-5-plan-reality-headset-new-macs-watchos-10-ios-17-lgjfj5bf\">says</a> that a pair of Mac Studio updates are being \"planned,\" though he doesn't know when they'll be out. (We would assume that the difference between the two models comes down to which processor they use; the M1 Mac and M1 Ultra versions of the Studio have several differences aside from raw CPU and GPU speed.)</p>\n<p>That nugget is one of several in a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-16/apple-wwdc-2023-june-5-plan-reality-headset-new-macs-watchos-10-ios-17-lgjfj5bf\">summary of Apple's plans</a> for its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Gurman adds small details to several stories he has reported in the recent past; the most interesting for Mac users is the 15-inch MacBook Air, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/15-inch-macbook-air-and-updated-13-inch-pro-appear-in-developer-logs/\">he said late last week</a> would likely include an M2 processor and the same 3024×1964 screen resolution as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Gurman now says Apple plans to announce the new Air at WWDC.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932216#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932216&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53e51210912ab71277f9d7a50d158797c8162b495fa3383d0e326322e839348a","category":"Tech"}
