{"title":"Apple's 16-Year-Old SuperDrive Now Out of Stock Worldwide, Likely Discontinued","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/11/apple-quietly-discontinues-16-year-old-accessory/","date":1728659100000,"content":"A few months ago, the SuperDrive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-superdrive-could-be-discontinued/\">went out of stock on Apple's online store</a> in the U.S., and it is now listed as sold out or unavailable in all countries. Given it has yet to return, it seems likely that Apple has discontinued the 16-year-old accessory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-SuperDrives.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIntroduced in 2008, the SuperDrive is an external CD/DVD drive that was released alongside the original MacBook Air, which lacked a built-in CD/DVD drive.

There are plenty of other CD/DVD drives for customers who really need one, and they don't require a USB-C adapter for use with modern Macs.
