Think of Danny Hart winning the 2011 downhill world championships in Champéry Switzerland and you’ll have a clear picture of what the Giant Glory has always been about.</p>\n<p>New for 2023 is a carbon frame and increased adjustability. There are three flip chips, with bottom bracket and head tube adjustment, and reach and chainstay length adjustments.</p>\n<p>The new lighter-weight frame is compatible with 650b and 29in rear wheels. It comes as standard with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mixed-wheel setup</a>.</p>\n<p>There is one model available, the Glory Advanced at £7,500/$8,000/AU$11,499, with European pricing to be confirmed. The Glory Advanced Legends Edition frameset with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/fox-suspension-fork-guide/\">Fox fork and shock</a> costs £6,000/$6,200/AU$8,999.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<div>\n<h4><span>Five things you need to know about the 2023 Giant Glory </span></h4>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul><li><span>First full carbon version of the Glory</span></li>\n<li><span>Increased adjustability, including reach adjustment, chainstay length adjustment, and bottom bracket height and head tube angle adjustment</span> </li>\n<li><span>Can fit 650b or 29in wheels</span> </li>\n<li><span>Updated Maestro suspension kinematics dish out 200mm of rear-wheel travel</span> </li>\n<li><span>Only the Glory Advanced complete build and Glory Advanced Legends Edition frameset are being released at present</span></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Going composite</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Factory Racing downhill team following each other on the Giant Gory Advanced.\" title=\"Giant Factory Racing downhill team\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Giant Glory Advanced will be under Giant’s factory riders for the 2023 UCI Downhill World Cup.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>This is the fifth-generation Glory. The 2023 bike has been redesigned and for the first time in its history, there’s a fully carbon frame available for purchase.</p>\n<p>Refined over the last two years, Giant says the frame uses its Advanced grade carbon fibre, constructed in its own carbon production factory. Giant claims this has enabled it to build a lighter, stiffer and quicker Glory than ever before. An S/M frame size is claimed to weigh in at 3.2kg.</p>\n<p>The new carbon frame features Giant’s MegaDrive box-section down tube. This oversized rectangular down tube profile is said to increase lateral and torsional stiffness to improve steering precision and pedalling efficiency.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Glory Advanced 2023 Megadrive downtube\" title=\"Giant Glory Advanced 2023 Megadrive downtube\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Giant’s MegaDrive box section down tube is claimed to improve steering precision and pedalling efficiency. It’s also clad in a hefty amount of frame protection.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>The new frame upper rocker also benefits from a high-pressure moulding process used to produce the hybrid aluminium and carbon fibre link, which Giant claims is lighter, stiffer and stronger than aluminium alone.</p>\n<p>The frame uses a downhill 12x157mm rear-hub standard. Giant also states the frame isn’t compatible with a 2023 or earlier RockShox Boxxer Ultimate or Select fork. This is likely because in some geometry settings, the fork crown doesn’t have enough space to clear the head tube.</p>\n<h2>Tailor your ride</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Glory Advanced 2023 changeable headset cups\" title=\"Giant Glory Advanced 2023 changeable headset cups\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Swappable headset cups enable you to increase or decrease the reach and front-centre lengths by 5mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>Along with the new carbon fibre frame, the biggest update is the Glory’s new adjustability. Through changeable headset cups, you can fine-tune the reach and front-centre lengths by –5mm, standard, and +5mm, giving you three positions to choose from.</p>\n<p>This is similar to the design on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-canyon-sender-cfr/\">Canyon Sender CFR</a>. This could be useful in setting up the bike for individual tracks, or to perfect your position on the bike if the stock setting isn’t quite perfect for you.</p>\n<p>The chainstay flip chip alters the length of the rear centre by 10mm. In the short setting, this is intended to liven up the ride and give quicker, more agile handling. In the long setting, the bike should have better stability for high-speed, open courses.</p>\n<p><span>There’s also a third flip chip in the main rocker. This features a three-position chip that slackens the head tube angle in 0.4-degree increments. It also lowers the bottom bracket in 5mm drops, from the bike’s high setting.</span></p>\n<p>These variations result in 18 possible geometry charts, enabling riders to find what works best for them. That’s without mentioning all the charts for the compatible 29in rear wheel.</p>\n<h2><span>Geometry details</span><span> </span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Glory advanced 2023 dropout flip-chip\" title=\"Giant Glory advanced 2023 dropout flip-chip\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The chainstay flip chip enables you to add 10mm to the chainstay length to increase high-speed stability for open tracks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>Let’s not bore you with 18 geometry charts. For the stock 27.5in rear-wheel bike, here are the key figures of the new Glory and how the flip chip settings change these.</p>\n<p>There are three sizes available: S/M, M/L and L/XL. Most dimensions look contemporary without being overly aggressive, all except a very slack head tube angle even for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Reach values start at 445mm for the S/M bike. These will end up 4mm shorter or longer once the headset cups are fitted, so range from 441mm to 449mm.</p>\n<p>For the M/L, these figures are 461/465/469mm, and on the L/XL increase to 482/485/489mm, respectively.</p>\n<p>Seat tube lengths are 430mm on the S/M bike and 450mm on the M/L and L/XL, so riders should be able to choose between sizes if they want to.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Glory Advanced Maestro three-position flip-chip\" title=\"Giant Glory Advanced Maestro three-position flip-chip\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The three-position Maestro flip chip in the upper rocker gives riders high, middle and low-position geometry settings to choose from.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>For the S/M frame, head tube angles are changeable between a slack 61.6 degrees, 61.9 degrees, and 62.3 degrees in the frame’s low, middle and high rocker link flip-chip settings.</p>\n<p>These are 61.7 degrees, 62 degrees and 62.3 degrees in the low, mid and high settings respectively for the M/L and L/XL bike sizes.</p>\n<p>The bottom bracket drop is 3mm in the high setting, 8mm in the middle and 13mm in the low position for all frames.</p>\n<p>Chainstay lengths for all bike sizes are shortest in the high frame setting at 445mm. This increases to 447mm in middle setting and 448mm in the low frame setting. You can add 10mm to these rear-centre lengths by putting the chainstay flip chip in the long setting.</p>\n<p>The stack heights are the same across the three frame sizes and decrease from a moderate 635mm in the low setting to 632mm and 629mm in the middle and low settings, respectively.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Giant Glory Advanced 2023 – 29/27.5in , Maestro mid, headset 0mm, chainstay short</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Size</b></td><td>S/M</td><td>M/L</td><td>L/XL</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>445</td><td>465</td><td>485</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>61.9</td><td>62</td><td>62</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>78.7</td><td>78.8</td><td>78.8</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube </b>(mm)</td><td>430</td><td>450</td><td>450</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay</b> (mm)</td><td>447</td><td>447</td><td>447</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>1,272</td><td>1,292</td><td>1,312</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Bottom bracket offset</b> (mm)</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>632</td><td>632</td><td>632</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube</b> (mm)</td><td>570</td><td>591</td><td>611</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Standover </b>(mm)</td><td>7380</td><td>740</td><td>748</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h3>29er geometry settings</h3>\n<p>Here’s a quick look at the bikes if you decide on a 29in rear wheel.</p>\n<p>Reach values range from 451-455-459mm on the S/M frame, from 471-475-479mm on the M/L frame, and 491-495-499mm on the L/XL frame.</p>\n<p>Head tube angles range from 62.5-62.8-63.2-degrees on all frame sizes in the low, middle and high frame flip-chip settings.</p>\n<p>Bottom bracket drops change between 10, 15 and 20mm in the high, middle, and low settings, respectively.</p>\n<p>Overall, the bike looks very capable and ready to tackle the steepest, most demanding courses.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Giant Glory Advanced 2023 - 29/29in , Maestro mid, headset 0mm, chainstay short</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Size</td><td>S/M</td><td>M/L</td><td>L/XL</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (mm)</td><td>455</td><td>475</td><td>495</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head angle (degrees)</td><td>62.8</td><td>62.9</td><td>62.9</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube angle (degrees)</td><td>79.6</td><td>79.7</td><td>79.7</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube (mm)</td><td>430</td><td>450</td><td>450</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay (mm)</td><td>446</td><td>447</td><td>447</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>1272</td><td>1292</td><td>1312</td>        </tr><tr><td>Bottom bracket offset (mm)</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack (mm)</td><td>625</td><td>625</td><td>625</td>        </tr><tr><td>Top tube (mm)</td><td>569</td><td>589</td><td>609</td>        </tr><tr><td>Standover (mm)</td><td>750</td><td>752</td><td>760</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h2>Conducting the trails</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Glory Advanced 2023 leverage ratio chart\" title=\"Giant Glory Advanced 2023 leverage ratio chart\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2023 Giant Glory is more progressive overall than its older version.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>The Maestro suspension isn’t new on the Glory, but it has been updated to help keep the bike current, while still dishing out its 200mm of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">rear-wheel travel</a>.</p>\n<p>The leverage rate has changed slightly to increase overall progressivity. It’s slightly more supple in the beginning stroke and more progressive through the end stroke to help add bottom-out resistance.</p>\n<p>The axle path has been changed and now has a slight rearward path during the first part of travel to help the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a> move out of the way over bumps.
