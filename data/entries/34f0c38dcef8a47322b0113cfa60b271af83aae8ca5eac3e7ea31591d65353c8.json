{"title":"Apple Pulls Bella Ramsey Ad That Promoted Vaporware Personalized Siri Feature","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/07/apple-pulls-ad-that-showed-siri-being-useful-after-delaying-feature-that-could-make-siri-useful/","date":1741464113000,"content":"\n<p>Zac Hall, 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since last fall, Apple has been marketing the iPhone 16 and Apple\nIntelligence with an unreleased Siri feature. After confirming\ntoday that the more personal version of Siri isn’t coming anytime\nsoon, Apple has pulled the ad in question.</p>\n\n<p>The commercial starred Bella Ramsey who should probably win an\naward for acting like Siri worked.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://x.com/iupdate/status/1898102090846925068\">the ad spot</a>, Ramsey sees someone familiar approaching and\nasks Siri the name of the person they had a meeting with the\nprevious month at a specific restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>Siri immediately responded with the name presumably based on a\ncalendar event, email, or message on Ramsey’s iPhone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <em>think</em> that was the only TV commercial Apple ran showing the “personalized Siri through App Intents” feature that Apple has now admitted won’t ship in iOS 18, but I saw that commercial a lot during the baseball playoffs and NFL season. (I tend to only to see TV commercials while watching sports.) Did they run other ads or billboards promoting this non-existent feature? I’m wondering what else they’re going to send down the memory hole now that they’ve come to their senses that it was a fantasy that these features would ship this year.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s product pages for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia/\">MacOS 15 Sequoia</a> are lousy with references to these “new era for Siri” features that <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features\">we now know</a> aren’t going to ship this year. This is a marketing fiasco.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/apple-pulls-bella-ramsey-ad-that-promoted-vaporware-personalized-siri-feature\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"34f0c38dcef8a47322b0113cfa60b271af83aae8ca5eac3e7ea31591d65353c8","category":"Tech"}
