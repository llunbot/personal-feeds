There has been a lot of racing action since we last spoke, with Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech) winning his second consecutive Route d‚ÄôOccitaine and Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) securing victory at the Baloise Belgium Tour. Mattias Skjelmose (Trek-Segafredo) won the men‚Äôs Tour de Suisse and Marlen Reusser (SD Worx) is currently leading the general classification for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-suisse-womens-preview\" target=\"_blank\">women‚Äôs Tour de Suisse</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=14577&amp;y=2023&amp;s=2\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There has also been pain and grieving. The death of Bahrain Victorious‚Äôs Gino M√§der after a crash at the Tour de Suisse has affected the entire cycling community. A talented rider and a wonderful man. May he rest in peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Cycling mourns Gino M√§der</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f-1f3fb.png\" alt=\"üôèüèª\" /> Gino, thank you for the light, the joy, and the laughs you brought us all, we will miss you as a rider and as a person.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"‚ù§\" /> Today and every day, we ride for you, Gino.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"üîó\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/CSx5BsWfRz\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/CSx5BsWfRz</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/caBmfmWwyg\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/caBmfmWwyg</a></p>‚Äî Team Bahrain Victorious (@BHRVictorious) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BHRVictorious/status/1669653010148990976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Gino M√§der died on Friday after crashing on the descent of the Albula Pass during Stage 5 of the Tour de Suisse. M√§der had crashed into a ravine and was resuscitated by medical staff, who performed CPR, before he was airlifted to hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His death was announced by his Bahrain Victorious team the following day. The statement read, ‚ÄòIt is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that we have to announce the passing of Gino M√§der. Our entire team is devastated by this tragic accident, and our thoughts and prayers are with Gino‚Äôs family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòDespite the best efforts of the phenomenal staff at Chur hospital, Gino couldn‚Äôt make it through this, his final and biggest challenge, and at 11:30am we said goodbye to one of the shining lights of our team. Gino was an extraordinary athlete, an example of determination, a valued member of our team and the whole cycling community. His talent, dedication, and passion for the sport has inspired us all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòGino, thank you for the light, the joy, and the laughs you brought us all, we will miss you as a rider and as a person. Today and every day, we ride for you, Gino.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 6 of the Tour de Suisse was neutralised and a minute‚Äôs silence held in his memory. Riders then boarded team buses and travelled to the final 30km of the route, where M√§der‚Äôs Bahrain Victorious teammates rode together at the front of the peloton. At the finish in Oberwil-Lieli, the peloton rode under a banner paying tribute to M√§der, saying, <strong>‚Äò</strong>We ride for you, Gino.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The peloton has been paying tribute to M√§der on social media and dedicating stage wins to him.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Incomprehensible.

However fan-captured footage posted by Italian website Tuttobiciweb showed numerous riders getting a tow up the mountain by holding on to team cars and race motorbikes. Frankly, it was embarrassing (<em>and hilarious ‚Äì Ed.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the next morning, 31 riders were disqualified from the Giro Next Gen, along with four <em>directeurs sportif</em> who were driving the cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stage and general classification was won by Norwegian Johannes Staune-Mittet of the Jumbo-Visma Development Team, with Hagen Berman Axeon‚Äôs Irish rider Darren Rafferty finishing in third on the day but second overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

(The same manner in which MJ famously announced his return to the NBA in 1995 following an abrupt retirement in 1993 to play minor league baseball.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 8 of the Tour of Britain will finish on Caerphilly Mountain, a 1.4km climb with an average gradient on 10.1%, on 10th September 2023. It last featured in the 2013 edition of the race where Irish sprinter Sam Bennett (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Bora-Hansgrohe</a>) claimed the first victory of his professional career for An Post-Chain Reaction. How time flies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the result of a four-year agreement between race organisers and the Welsh government to host either the start or finish of either the Tour of Britain or Women‚Äôs Tour, which will alternate in the years through to 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also announced today that Stage 3 will start in Goole in Yorkshire before heading west to finish in Beverley, it‚Äôll be the first time the East Riding of Yorkshire has hosted a stage of the Tour of Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere in race news, it‚Äôs National Championship week. ITT and road races will take place across the globe, including Great Britain‚Äôs U23 and Elite ITT races on Wednesday 21st June, circuit races on Friday 23rd June and road races on Sunday 25th June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You‚Äôll find out what happened in the next edition of Pro Log.
