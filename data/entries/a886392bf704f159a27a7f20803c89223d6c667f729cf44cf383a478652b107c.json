{"title":"Apple Unveils New M4 MacBook Pro Lineup, Including, Hallelujah, a Nano-Texture Display Option","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/","date":1730326468000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now available in space black and silver finishes, the 14-inch\nMacBook Pro includes the blazing-fast performance of M4 and three\nThunderbolt 4 ports, starting with 16GB of memory, all at just\n$1,599. The 14- and 16-inch models with M4 Pro and M4 Max offer\nThunderbolt 5 for faster transfer speeds and advanced\nconnectivity. All models include a Liquid Retina XDR display that\ngets even better with an all-new nano-texture display option and\nup to 1000 nits of brightness for SDR content, an advanced 12MP\nCenter Stage camera, along with up to 24 hours of battery life,\nthe longest ever in a Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The base model, with the regular M4 chip, is less of a not-so-pro forgotten stepchild now. It gets a third Thunderbolt port, and is available in the same space black as the M4 Pro and Max models — last year the dark version of the plain M3 MacBook Pro was boring space gray.</p>\n\n<p>After the M4 iMacs were announced Monday, my <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/28/m4-imacs-introduced\">fingers were crossed</a> for a nano-texture MacBook Pro display, and I was rewarded. The option costs just $150 on both the 14- and 16-inch models. Can’t wait to see it in person. Can we get a nano-texture display option for iPhones next year too?  Matte’s where it’s at, baby.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0cmfY7qdmY\">Apple’s 15-minute mini-keynote</a>, with a 2-minute gag at the end.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/30/m4-macbook-pros-introduced\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a886392bf704f159a27a7f20803c89223d6c667f729cf44cf383a478652b107c","category":"Tech"}
