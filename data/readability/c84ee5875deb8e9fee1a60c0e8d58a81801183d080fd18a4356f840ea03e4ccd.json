Deal and his father found they could talk about everything on their journey, the outdoors brought about a calm clarity, which was very special to him.</p><h3>More than a ride</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130233/Velocio-Homeland-Greg-front-riding.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130233/Velocio-Homeland-Greg-front-riding.jpeg\" alt=\"Velocio Homeland Greg front riding\" width=\"1280\" height=\"707\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130233/Velocio-Homeland-Greg-front-riding.jpeg 1280w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130233/Velocio-Homeland-Greg-front-riding-297x164.jpeg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130233/Velocio-Homeland-Greg-front-riding-800x442.jpeg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130233/Velocio-Homeland-Greg-front-riding-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130233/Velocio-Homeland-Greg-front-riding-768x424.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></a></p><p>Now that Greg Deal has children of his own, he still uses his time on the bike to connect with the land, his ancestors and find the calm clarity that cycling opens within.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail.jpeg\" alt=\"Velocio Homeland jersey face detail\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail.jpeg 1280w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11130249/Velocio-Homeland-jersey-face-detail-125x125.jpeg 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></a></p><p>Filmmaker Chris Milliman documented Deal’s ride back on the White Rim trail, starting in Lake Tahoe and ending at Pyramid Lake.
