'You can even close your eyes, which is a powerful training tool that helps one to tap into where you are physically and psychologically.'</p>\n<p>For D'Ercole, riding with music is another benefit of spin classes.</p>\n<p>'Music has the power to push us beyond what we otherwise may have done at times,' she says.</p>\n<p>'And then when I need to have a lower intensity recovery ride, I can adjust the music which helps me stay focussed and not give in to ego-urges to push harder than I should.'</p>\n<h2>Will spin classes interfere with my regular training?</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/spin_bike_close_up.jpg?itok=Cxw09fbX\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>For cyclists who follow a strict training regime, spin classes can be problematic as the rider doesn’t know what the spin class workout will be as this is up to the instructor.</p>\n<p>'When you go to a spin class you don’t know exactly what the workout will be and you don't have any control over it,' says Wilson.</p>\n<p>'If an athlete is preparing for a competition season that goes from March to October, and they go to lots of spin classes in winter, it might actually be too intense at some points and make the athlete more susceptible to injuries.</p>\n<p>'The key with spin classes is that you should have good communication between a coach and an athlete, as if the spin class is quite intense, then there needs to be pretty easy days built around that.'</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/peloton_bike_-_lifestyle_04.jpg?itok=05q7VZci\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Streather echoes this sentiment and adds: 'Spin classes are not targeted towards a specific cyclist's goals and can be hard for a coach to incorporate into a bespoke training plan.</p>\n<p>'These sessions can be very intense, so doing multiple sessions per week will start to leave the cyclist fatigued and too many spin classes in the off season could lead to a cyclist being burnt out before race season even starts.'</p>\n<p>However, for D'Ercole the answer is that a rider can adapt the session to suit them.</p>\n<p>'If a teacher is spending more time out of the saddle than you want or need, for example, you are empowered to own your ride,' she says.</p>\n<h2>Spin classes and bike fit: is there a risk of injury?</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/spin_bike.jpg?itok=Z8KH7NJ7\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Another quandary around spin classes is that the bike is not be set up as your normal bike, which can add the risk of injury.</p>\n<p>'A spin bike is rarely set up in an ideal position for a cyclist and will be very different to the position the rider would have on their own bike,' explains Streather.</p>\n<p>'What's more, the flywheel on the spin bike can cause injuries to cyclists' knees if used incorrectly.'</p>\n<p>Wilson advises taking some measurements of your bike at home in order to mirror that set up.</p>\n<p>'Even though you probably can't get exactly the same setup, I would advise taking some of the main measurements, such as saddle height and how far back the saddle is, as adjusting the spin bike to suit the rider will probably make things a little bit better.'</p>\n<h2>The bottom line: spin classes are not a cycling substitute, but can be valuable in their own right</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/peloton_bike_-_lifestyle_03.jpg?itok=0L2eyNaF\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Spin classes are not a substitute for riding your bike, nor are they going to be easily integrated into a cyclist training plan, and the loud music might not be to everyone’s taste.</p>\n<p>But, with the right goals in mind, spin classes can be great for social stimulation, motivation and an intense aerobic workout.</p>\n<p>Plus if you are after a workout with a passionate instructor, heart pumping music, with some strobe lights thrown in, look no further. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/training\">Training</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3aabcc94e1c94688124c0b8677b7449d44f2c92b25d09459a08c23d022827f20","category":"Cycling"}
