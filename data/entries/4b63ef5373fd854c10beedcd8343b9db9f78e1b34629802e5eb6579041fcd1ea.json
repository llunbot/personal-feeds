Eventually, he ranted about modern mobile phones, how touchscreen keyboards suck, and how the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/512377/rim_launches_two_new_blackberrys_and_voice_over_wifi_service.html\">BlackBerry</a> and its hardware keyboard was an awesome phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never got the real name of Atomic Bomb Ken, nor do I know how to contact him. If I could, I would tell him about the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.clicks.tech/product/clicks-for-iphone&amp;xcust=1-1-2192676-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Clicks Creator Keyboard</a>, a $139 iPhone case that has a hardware keyboard at the bottom and makes the iPhone look BlackBerry-ish. Compatible with the iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro, the case has a Lightning or USB-C connector that attaches to the iPhone. You can then use the keyboard for typing, and since no touchscreen keyboard appears, you can get a full view of what’s on the iPhone display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard has the familiar QWERTY layout, along with a dedicated microphone key for voice input. Users can even use the Command key for keyboard shortcut combos, such as Command+H to go to the Home screen, or Command+Spacebar for Spotlight. The company was co-founded by Michael Fisher, a tech reviewer known as <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@TheMrMobile&amp;xcust=1-1-2192676-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Mobile</a> on YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, the Creator Keyboard adds a considerable amount of length to the iPhone–it extends 7.41 inches (188.3 millimeters), which is an additional 1.64 inches (41.1 mm). But hey, that’s the price you pay for satisfying a nostalgic urge. Clicks Technology offers the case in BumbleBee (yellow) or London Sky, which looks like Space Gray and seems like a depressing allusion to mates in the U.K. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 Pro models that are shipping February 1 and mid-March, respectively, Clicks is accepting $30 deposits toward the $159 iPhone 15 Pro Max model that will be available this spring. It’s a whopping 8 inches (204.1 mm) long, so hopefully your low-rise jeans from the 2000s have deep pockets.</p>\n\niPhone, Mobile Phone Cases and Covers</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4b63ef5373fd854c10beedcd8343b9db9f78e1b34629802e5eb6579041fcd1ea","category":"Apple"}
