[…]</p>\n\n<p>The announcement could be timed a day before the Tuesday start of Google’s annual I/O conference, where the tech giant is expected to unveil a slew of AI-related products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Remember the thing about Netflix being in a race to become HBO before HBO could become Netflix? My money here is that Google can become OpenAI (with generative AI) before OpenAI can become Google (with search), because I just don’t think OpenAI has any sort of moat around ChatGPT. They’re ahead but everyone else is nipping at their heels.</p>\n\n<p>But: Google has left itself vulnerable by allowing the quality of Google Search results <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/24/zitron-google-search\">to degrade so much in recent years</a>. Google remains dominant in search, but <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-huge-search-market-share-loss-wasnt-real-data-revised-440191\">their share has started dropping</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/10/reuters-openai-web-search\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f1cc151548da7bb44a2b86e2d3b22bac068a48c2d4634e30bc4d89a4f0dae8fa","category":"Tech"}
