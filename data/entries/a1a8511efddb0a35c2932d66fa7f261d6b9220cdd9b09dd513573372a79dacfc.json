What if you could own <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc&amp;utm_term=scsf-613612&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AnddIAC&amp;scsonar=1\">Office apps</a> instead of having another subscription? Like, pay once instead of every month?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a reality with a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc&amp;utm_term=scsf-613612&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AnddIAC&amp;scsonar=1\">Microsoft Office lifetime license</a>. No subscriptions, rising prices, or nonsense here—just your favorite apps downloaded onto your Mac (or PC, we suppose) for lifelong use. The newest version is currently on sale for a limited time: $159.97 (reg. $249.99).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Office 2024 includes all your favorite tools: <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc&amp;utm_term=scsf-613612&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AnddIAC&amp;scsonar=1\">Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote</a>. Just like Microsoft 365, it even has AI features like intelligent suggestions for text, formatting, and design elements, data analysis in Excel, and brainstorming content in Word. You’ll find that Office 2024 also has significant improvements over older versions if you’re thinking about upgrading.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc&amp;utm_term=scsf-613612&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AnddIAC&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gTM3ifR.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Get <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-2024-home-business-for-mac-or-pc&amp;utm_term=scsf-613612&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AnddIAC&amp;scsonar=1\">Microsoft Office 2024</a> for Mac (or Windows) while it’s on sale for $159.97 (reg. $249.99).
