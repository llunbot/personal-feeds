Apple was planning to produce 90 million ‌iPhone 13‌ models in 2021, but Broadcom and Texas Instruments were unable to deliver enough components.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple was aiming to make up the shortfall in 2022 when supplies improve, but Apple has now informed vendors that it may not end up getting the necessary orders from customers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDuring Apple's fourth quarter earnings call in October, Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> said that the supply constraints on iPhones, iPads, and Macs had already cost Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/apple-supply-constraints-6-billion-q4-2021/\">around $6 billion</a>, and that the supply issues would continue into December.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt launch, available ‌iPhone 13‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> models sold out quickly, and for a good month after launch, there were long lead times on shipments.
