But, I have a weakness for handsome, high-quality<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-camp-and-go-slows-western-rattler-bar-tape-is-a-gift-to-mankind/\" target=\"_blank\"> bar tape</a>, so we are going to concentrate on the bar tape today.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-first-pic.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1006\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-first-pic.webp\" alt=\"Souma Premium Leather Bar Tape first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-first-pic.webp 1006w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-first-pic-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-first-pic-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-first-pic-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Family.

The tape is crafted from a single, continuous piece of leather. This ensures the durability of leather and gives the bar tape a life span that should be longer than most synthetic tapes on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-the-wrap.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-the-wrap.webp\" alt=\"Souma Premium Leather Bar Tape the wrap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-the-wrap.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-the-wrap-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-the-wrap-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-the-wrap-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-black.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-black.webp\" alt=\"Souma Premium Leather Bar Tape black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-black.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-black-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-black-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-black-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Souma says they’ve “gone the extra mile” to meet all of the requirements of a great leather bicycle handlebar tape. You’ll get a comfortable, natural feeling grip on the bar. The transitions from flat to hoods promise to be smooth between the wraps, providing a pleasant experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than a completely flat piece of leather, the tape is 2.5mm thick in the center, and tapers to 0.6mm at the edges to give it a nice wrap and overlapping. There’s even color-matched waxed cotton tape to use as finishing tape near the stem. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-brown-end-plug.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-brown-end-plug.webp\" alt=\"Souma Premium Leather Bar Tape brown end plug\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-brown-end-plug.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-brown-end-plug-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-brown-end-plug-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-brown-end-plug-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the other end, premium locking bar end plugs finish the look. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leather Bar Tape Retail and Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-wood.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-wood.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-wood.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-wood-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-wood-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-Premium-Leather-Bar-Tape-wood-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-leather-bar-tape-package.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-leather-bar-tape-package-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-leather-bar-tape-package-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-leather-bar-tape-package-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-leather-bar-tape-package-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-leather-bar-tape-package-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Souma-leather-bar-tape-package.webp 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $78 (comes with free leather conditioner)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colors: Black, Brown, Honey</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Premium Full-Grain Leather:</strong> Provides a natural, comfortable feel during rides.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Perfect Dimensions:</strong> Length 210-215 cm, Width 3 cm, Thickness 2.5 mm at the center, tapering to 0.6 mm at the ends for optimal fit and comfort.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strong Double-Sided 3M Tape:</strong> Ensures a secure fit that won’t slip during your ride.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Includes Bar-End Plugs:</strong> Adds a polished finish and extra security for your handlebars.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Easy Assembly Kit:</strong> Comes with waxed cotton tape, electrical tape, and a hex key for straightforward installation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to upgrade your bike with Souma’s Premium Leather Handlebar Tape, or you need an authentic bar tape for that restoration job you’re in the middle of, then check out the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://soumaleather.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SoumaLeather.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/souma-premium-leather-bicycle-bar-tape/\">Family-Run Souma Leather Introduces Premium Leather Bar Tape</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"885660260f0604727a0cb3121e1c9f34c6257035aadc8ce415cffa49b501531c","category":"Cycling"}
