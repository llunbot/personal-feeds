As we have now passed the watershed opening to the transfer market on 1st August, and  so moves can start to be revealed publicly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means teams and riders can finally put us out of our misery and share the news of who’s gone where for 2025, but the rumours will keep on circling until all rosters are filled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the men, Simon Yates and Jai Hindley are among the hottest properties on the transfer market this year. There are also plenty of rumours brewing around riders cutting ties early. On the women’s side, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> champion Demi Vollering is expected to move away from SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike are rumoured to be signing MTB World and Olympics champ Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, and Elisa Longo Borghini is on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\r\n

Saturday, Alaphilippe shared the news that he will be leaving Soudal-Quickstep. In an interview, he said: ‘My decision has been made and I will communicate about it soon. Nothing has been signed yet, but in my mind the deal is done.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will end a turbulent decade with the Belgian squad led by Patrick Lefevre. Their relationship soured over the past two years and it became clear earlier in the year that Alaphilippe, a double world champion, would be heading elsewhere. Currently, Tudor Pro Cycling are leading the charge for Alaphilippe’s signature. The rider himself shared that he had made up his mind, and it has now been circling for at least a month that Alapahilippe would join Cancellara’s Swiss team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lefevre seems optimistic about Alaphilippe’s chances of staying with the team, saying, ‘If he chooses with his heart, then I think he will stay with us [Soudal Quickstep]’. The Belgian manager of the team also suggested that TotalEnergies and Tudor have been in contact with the Frenchman regarding his 2025 contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has also been confirmed that Dane Kasper Asgreen will leave the team along with Jan Hirt who finished inside the top 10 of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia </a>this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Juliette Labous moves to FDJ-Suez</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"juliette labous\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Eloise Mavian/Tornati CC</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Juliette Labous, an eternal fixture in the top five of women’s Grand Tour GCs, has announced her departure from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\">Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL</a>. After riding for the German team since 2017, when Labous was just 17 years old, the French rider will move across to FDJ-Suez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labous has signed a three-year contract, which will see her through until her 29th birthday. Labous will join Demi Vollering at FDJ-Suez if we are to believe the rumours. Évita Muzic will also provide another key card for FDJ-Suez next year. With these signings, FDJ-Suez is quickly becoming a super-team within the women’s peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘French champion and top five in the last two Tours de France, Juliette is a remarkable athlete and undeniably one of the best climbers in the professional peloton,’ says FDJ-Suez’s team’s general manager Stephen Delcourt. ‘We are also honoured by Juliette’s confidence in our project and our vision. Her arrival is another step towards realising our sporting ambitions,’ he continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Marc Hirschi signs for Tudor Pro Cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"marc hirschi klassikoa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-10-at-17.01.40-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh from a UCI WorldTour victory at the Klassikoa, Marc Hirschi has confirmed his transfer to Tudor Pro Cycling. The Swiss team headed by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/fabian-cancellara-on-life-in-retirement-i-m-busier-now-than-when-i-raced\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Cancellara</a> has been growing in the past few seasons. As shown by making their Grand Tour debut at the Giro this year, the squad has been rising through the ranks courtesy of some big-name transfers such as Alberto Dainese, Arvid de Kleijn, Michael Storer and Matteo Trentin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hirschi will lead the squad’s Classics line-up in the years to come. Tudor have secured some top-tier race invites including Paris-Nice and Tirenno-Adriatico. The Swiss team is not far off from a promotion to the UCI WorldTour in the next five years. With all-stars like Hirschi, they could garner more attention and wildcard invitations to achieve this goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transfer brings to an end Hirschi’s four-year-long partnership with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>. He signed for the team at the beginning of 2021 after <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/marc-hirschi-and-team-dsm-part-ways-with-immediate-effect\" target=\"_blank\">an abrupt divorce with Team DSM</a>. Since then, Hirschi has scored some solid one-day victories, but he only made two Grand Tour appearances during his four seasons at the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Simon Yates to Visma-Lease a Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"simon yates klassikoa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/IMG_0965-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>NaikePhotoSport</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been formally announced this month that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Yates’s</a> next destination will be Visma-Lease a Bike.

Simon will have the opportunity to go for his own results with us, but he will also be a valuable asset for the team in the mountains.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After ten years spent at Jayco-AlUla, this will mark the end of one of cycling’s longest-running partnerships, which saw Yates claim a Vuelta a España victory and a Giro d’Italia podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a quest to strengthen its grip on the Classics, Visma-Lease a Bike has also announced the signing of French rider Alex Zingle from Cofidis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Ben O’Connor and Co. to Jayco-AlUla</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GNMlLoPXEAAsNdM-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jayco-AlUla have announced that they will replace Simon Yates with Perth-born Ben O’Connor. High in confidence from a fourth-place finish at the Giro in May, O’Connor will lead Jayco-AlUla’s Tour de France hopes for at least the next two seasons. Despite his Australian nationality, O’Connor has never ridden for<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jayco-alula\" target=\"_blank\"> the GreenEdge project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘To be honest, it’s really an idea I’ve always loved; to race as an Aussie and win on an Aussie team,’ O’Connor told the press following the announcement on Thursday. ‘I’m at a point now where I need to deliver, so it’ll be even more special to do it with an Australian set-up. To have the opportunity to race with mates at the top level is rare, and I am just so keen to get stuck in.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with O’Connor, Paul Double, Koen Bouwman and Patrick Gamper will join the squad. All three of these riders are string climbers. Bouwman won the <em>maglia azzurra</em> at the Giro d’Italia in 2022 while Paul Double finished in 3rd place overall at the Tour of Turkey. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Alexey Lutsenko to Israel-Premier Tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-970x647.png\" alt=\"alexey lutsenko astana\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A frontman for Astana Qazaqstan, Alexey Lutsenko will leave the Kazakh squad after 12 years spent with the team.

Astana are in desperate need of some UCI points. The squad look poised for relegation if they don’t improve on their results in the next year.

The roster is not as deep as Lidl-Trek’s, so Longo Borghini will likely have to rely on her own expertise at her new destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At her former team Lidl-Trek, Gaia Realini will now assume the GC leader position after having extended her contract until 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: Demi Vollering to leave SD Worx</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2166635091-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption> Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In March, GCN<em> </em>broke the news that Demi Vollering will be leaving SD Worx-Protime at the end of 2024. After a partnership that has resulted in Classics victories and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\" target=\"_blank\">a Tour de France Femmes</a> title, the Dutch champion will go elsewhere for 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s perhaps not a surprise given the increasing powers of Lotte Kopecky and return of Anna van der Breggen next season, Vollering is the biggest name in the women’s market this year and there is a fierce and exclusive battle for her signature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources disclose that Vollering’s agent was in serious talks with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> up until the Tour of Flanders when the American team pulled back their interest in support of their current roster’s future objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FDJ-Suez remain a strong contender, but the viability of this rumour is up in the air as the team lays eyes on other objectives. Elsewhere, UAE Team ADQ have fallen out of the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vollering, who according to sources has been offered a €1 million per year contract, is running out of options if she wants to remain adamant about a move away from<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/sd-worx\" target=\"_blank\"> SD Worx</a>. We wait with bated breath to see who enters the ring as Vollering’s future home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other men’s rumours</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-970x647.png\" alt=\"emanuel buchmann 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T114912.722.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of rumours awaiting confirmation within the men’s peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giro d’Italia stage winner Valentin Paret-Peintre looks set to move to Soudal-QuickStep. He will leave his older brother Aurélien at Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale in favour of supporting Remco Evenepoel’s GC hopes. Ethan Hayter, the current British champion, is also expected to move across to Soudal-Quickstep in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evenepoel’s current domestiques Fausto Masnada and Jan Hirt are reported to be on the move for 2025. The former, a podium finisher at Il Lombardia, will move to the Swiss-South African Continental squad Q36.5, while Hirt, a top ten finisher at the Giro on two occasions, will head to Israel-Premier Tech. Alex Aranburu is rumoured to be heading out of Movistar in favour of Cofidis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of confirmations, Emanuel Buchmann has finally signed for Cofidis, Laurence Pithie and Finn Fisher-Black bring two Kiwis into Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Simon Carr has signed for Cofidis from EF. As we previously reported, Jonathan Narváez and Florian Vermeersch have signed contracts for 2025 with UAE Team Emirates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other women’s rumours</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the women, Lotte Kopecky and Lorena Wiebes have penned hefty contract extensions until 2028.
