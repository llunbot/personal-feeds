In an example Corazza presented at the conference, a user could ask the system to \"make orb turn red and destroy after 0.3 seconds when player touches it.\" The system then generates a seven-line <a href=\"https://create.roblox.com/docs/tutorials/scripting/basic-scripting/intro-to-scripting\">Lua function</a> that does just that, based on a coder-defined orb object provided earlier in the code.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925473#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925473&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f89c2905bbed14a3bec32c7b624cb5828d63cfb5a2b232a2cb20cde8f26e242e","category":"Tech"}
