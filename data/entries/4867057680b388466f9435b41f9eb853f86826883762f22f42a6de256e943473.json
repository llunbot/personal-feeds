Aboard the desolate Sevastopol space station, her search for answers soon becomes a desperate fight for survival as she's relentlessly hunted by the deadly xenomorph.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPraising Feral's faithful port as a \"phenomenal conversion,\" <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2021/12/16/alien-isolation-mobile-review-frame-rate-resolution-performance-battery-saver-ipad-pro-iphone-11-settings/\">TouchArcade</a></em>'s Mikhail Madnani says the game has \"aged brilliantly\" and is made all the more enjoyable thanks to the high-quality visuals and graphical options, not to mention Feral's inclusion of full touchscreen support, controller support, and even keyboard and mouse support on ‌iPad‌.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>If you've not played Alien: Isolation before, the mobile version is phenomenal. It isn't just a good value proposition with all DLC included at the low asking price of $14.99 compared to other platforms, but it looks and runs brilliantly even compared to the Xbox and PS4 versions. I know Feral Interactive is capable of miracle mobile conversions, but this Alien: Isolation is on a whole other level.</blockquote>Priced at $14.99 and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/alien-isolation/id1573029040\">available now on the App Store</a>, <em>Alien: Isolation</em> on iOS includes the base game, all seven DLC packs including \"Crew Expendable,\" \"Last Survivor,\" and the \"Survivor Mode.\" The \"Survivor Mode\" is an additional download, making the game's total install size around 11GB. The game has also been released on the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feralinteractive.alienisolation_android\">Google Play Store</a> for Android.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe game supports ‌iPhone‌ 7 Plus, ‌iPhone‌ 8 Plus, ‌iPhone‌ X and later, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> (2020).
