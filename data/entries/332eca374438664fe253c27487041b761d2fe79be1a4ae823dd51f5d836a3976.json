Spread over 12 days, with around 100km and 2,000m of climbing on each of the ten ride days, the route weaves eastward through this storied mountain range from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean coast, taking in famous cols, sleepy villages and silent mountain landscapes. It’s an alternative take on the famous Raid Pyrénéen route in France, but traces its way across the Pyrenees on the less-visited Spanish side of the border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pyrenean climbs have featured heavily in both Tour de France and Vuelta a España history, and over the course of the trip riders will follow in the wheeltracks of these famous races. The region also hosts one of Europe’s largest sportives each year, the Quebrantahuesos Challenge. The Pyrenean Traverse follows the same route but breaks it into two more palatable helpings across two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a four-star physical excursion, requiring a good level of fitness, but Saddle Skedaddle will be on hand to provide constant support and take care of every eventuality, leaving you to focus on turning the pedals. From the fiery Basque country to the hazy lake of Banyoles, the Pyrenean Traverse has a bit of everything. Here are some of the highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Col de Marie-Blanque</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It might not be the longest climb you’ll take on, but make no mistake, the denouement of the Col de Marie-Blanque might be the hardest 4km of riding in the entire fortnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In full, the western ascent is just under 10km long, with the first half a pleasant climb up the Asp Valley with gradients rarely brushing even 6%. But once the road closes in, so does the elevation, with ramps in excess of 10% ensuring a bruising drag up to the panoramic views that reward you once you reach the plateau.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2.webp 1200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-750x501.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pyrenean-traverse-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Grand Tour organisers haven’t shied away from including the Marie-Blanque in their race routes, with the climb having featured 15 times in the Tour and once in the Vuelta. On the fifth stage of the 2023 Tour, Australian Jai Hindley blasted away from Felix Gall at the base of the climb to win the stage, taking the yellow jersey in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Puerto de Portalet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At almost 30km long and with gradients averaging around 4.5% as it rises to a summit of 1,794m, the Category 1 Puerto Portalet is not to be taken lightly, especially with 5km of flat road distorting that average gradient figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders will be glad of the tree cover on the lower slopes which – via a few avalanche tunnels – eventually gives way to colossal peaks and sprawling vistas. The climb forms the backbone of the Quebrantahuesos Challenge and has been used regularly as a summit finish in the Vuelta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2023 Vuelta, Romain Bardet was first over the Portalet, however the stage started at altitude and only 4.4km of the climb was actually ridden, part of a short, sharp Stage 13 that also took in the Col d’Aubisque and climaxed on the Tourmalet, with Jonas Vingegaard winning as Jumbo-Visma took a famous 1-2-3 finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coll de Josa</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tackled from its west side, the Coll de Josa features on the ninth day of the Pyrenean Traverse while winding through the Serra de Cadi. It’s a lot shorter than the Portalet, and its 11.2km at 4.6% doesn’t look too punishing on paper. But despite never having featured in either the Tour or the Vuelta, the Coll de Josa is an ascent to be reckoned with. A kilometre of downhill makes the average gradient flatter to deceive, while the penultimate kilometre kicks up to 9%, both things conspiring to make a climb that’s much more than the sum of its stats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After meandering through lush forest for much of the ride, the looming Pedraforca – a stone fork of mountain – comes into view and dominates the skyline in the latter stages of the climb. With Perpignan, Girona and the Mediterranean on the horizon, the end of the Traverse will be starting to come into focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Banyoles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there’s no climbing to be done in Banyoles, the Lake of Banyoles’ cooling waters might be one of the most welcome sights in the entirety of the Pyrenean Traverse. Often a starting or finishing point for the nearby Rocacorba climb, no trip to Catalonia is complete without dipping some weary toes in the lake’s turquoise waters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Said to have formed around a quarter of a million years ago, the Lake of Banyoles and the surrounding wetlands are hugely ecologically significant to the region and have hosted numerous international watersports events. A key feature are the seemingly floating fisherman’s houses that dot the shoreline, giving the lake an almost otherworldly feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having ticked off another 1,200-plus metres of climbing on the tenth day of the trip, Banyoles is the perfect landing pad for some tired legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Saddle Skedaddle ‘Pyrenean Traverse’ and other Spanish cycling trips</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.skedaddle.com/uk/home/page/Cyclist_Magazine_Offer/491/view.rails?utm_source=magazine&amp;utm_medium=magazine&amp;utm_campaign=Cyclist+Magazine+June+25\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for exclusive Cyclist reader discounts on Saddle Skedaddle cycling holidays in Spain.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pyrenean-traverse\">Discover the Pyrenean Traverse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"332eca374438664fe253c27487041b761d2fe79be1a4ae823dd51f5d836a3976","category":"Cycling"}
