Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPRMyQSZGuY\">CNBC Television</a>, he said, \"We have seen that you can embed viruses in the cartridges. Through the cartridge, [the virus can] go to the printer, [and then] from the printer, go to the network.\"</p>\n<p>That frightening scenario could help explain why HP, which was hit this month with another <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-sued-again-for-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-accused-of-monopoly/\">lawsuit over its Dynamic Security system</a>, insists on deploying it to printers.</p>\n<p>Dynamic Security stops HP printers from functioning if an ink cartridge without an HP chip or HP electronic circuitry is installed. HP has issued firmware updates that block printers with such ink cartridges from printing, leading to the above lawsuit (<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HP_Janunary_5_2023.pdf\">PDF</a>), which is seeking class-action certification. The suit alleges that HP printer customers were not made aware that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/customers-fume-as-hp-blocks-third-party-ink-from-more-of-its-printers/\">printer firmware updates</a> issued in late 2022 and early 2023 could result in printer features not working. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and an injunction preventing HP from issuing printer updates that block ink cartridges without an HP chip.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997422#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997422&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"65d344e1084eb881089363131045afe61cb828e09227ce20d34b9fa92cf28ed2","category":"Tech"}
