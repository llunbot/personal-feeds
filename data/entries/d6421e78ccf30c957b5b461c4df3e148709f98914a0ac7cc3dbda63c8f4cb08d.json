Twenty-two states along with Puerto Rico will be the recipients of this first round of funding from the $2.5 billion Charging and Fueling Infrastructure program, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/govt-opens-2-5-billion-for-ev-chargers-in-rural-and-underserved-areas/\">started accepting applications</a> in March 2023.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/climate/us-carbon-emissions-2023-climate.html\">US carbon emissions fell last year</a>, most of that was achieved through much cleaner energy generation. But when it comes to transportation's contribution to our annual carbon impact, that line is sadly still going up. Which is why it was encouraging that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2022 included $7.5 billion for clean vehicle infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Two-thirds of that was set aside for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program. That $5 billion is being spent mostly on DC fast charging infrastructure, mostly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/heres-how-the-government-plans-to-make-ev-chargers-common-and-reliable/\">at regular intervals along highway corridors</a>, but also on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/feds-open-up-100-million-funding-for-ev-charger-reliability-grants/\">charger reliability</a>. Rather than paying for the chargers directly, the federal government is awarding it to states and metropolitan planning organizations the way it does with other highway formula funds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995441#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995441&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
