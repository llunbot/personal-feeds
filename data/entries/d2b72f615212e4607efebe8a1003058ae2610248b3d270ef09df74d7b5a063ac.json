These updates are free, and can add new features to your watch, improve its speed and fix bugs and glitches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version, available to download on September 16, 2024 is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 11</a>, which brings new apps, new features, new face customization options, an upgraded Smart Stack, and extensive changes to the Apple Watch’s health and fitness functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to install the latest version of watchOS on your Apple Watch, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we show how to update an Apple Watch so it’s running the latest version of watchOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get a version of watchOS that hasn’t yet become available to the general public so you can try out upcoming watch updates ahead of everyone else? Find out more in our article demonstrating <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350193/watchos-public-beta-install.html\">how to install a watchOS beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Apple Watches can run watchOS 11?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>watchOS 11 will work with the Apple Watch Series 6 or later. Sadly the Series 4, Series 5 and original SE Apple Watches that ran watchOS 10 and watchOS 9 are no longer compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Watches include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Series 6 (2020)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 7 (2021) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch SE 2 (2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 8 (2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra (2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 9 (2023)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2 (2023)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 10 (2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You will also need a compatible iPhone, which includes the iPhone XS or later, or iPhone SE (2nd generation or later). You will also need to be running iOS 18 on your iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update your Apple Watch via iPhone </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the launch of watchOS 6 in 2019, Apple Watch updates had to happen on the watch’s associated iPhone rather than on the watch itself, but for a few years now it has been possible to update your Watch on the Watch itself. However, we still think updating via an iPhone is the easiest method.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3664313/how_to_update_apple_watch_800_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"How to update watchOS on Apple Watch: Watch app\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"How to update watchOS on Apple Watch: Watch app\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"How to update watchOS on Apple Watch: Watch app\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Grab your iPhone and open the Apple Watch app. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure you’re in the My Watch tab along the bottom menu and then tap General.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There may well be a little orange ‘1’ next to the Software Update option, indicating that an update is available (there’ll be a red ‘1’ next to the My Watch tab too); however, you may have to get the app to check for updates before you see this. Either way, tap Software Update and the app will run a check, then show you the details of the new version of watchOS that’s available to install.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap install and accept the terms &amp; conditions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In order to install this new version your iPhone and Apple Watch will need to be in Bluetooth range, the watch must be connected to its charger and on at least 50% power and, as with all OS updates, you need to be on Wi-Fi.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The update can take a while but <strong>do not</strong> be tempted to take the watch off its charger before it’s finished. We have done this in the past and it has disrupted the update process so badly that we have had to throw ourselves on Apple’s mercy and get the watch replaced.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update Apple Watch on the Apple Watch itself</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also install updates on an Apple Watch without requiring an iPhone.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3664313/update_watchos_on_apple_watch_settings_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"How to update watchOS on the Apple Watch itself\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"How to update watchOS on the Apple Watch itself\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"How to update watchOS on the Apple Watch itself\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Settings app on your watch. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap General &gt; Software Update. watchOS will check for available updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If an update is available, tap Install and follow further instructions. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the iPhone update, the Watch will need to sit on its charger for the installation stage and be connected to Wi-Fi. It should also have more than 50% battery power.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to do if you can’t update your Apple Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Troubleshooting Apple Watch update problems</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are facing difficulties updating your Apple Watch we offer the best solutions below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make space</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672771/how-to-install-watchos-8-on-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch Series 3 users had difficulty installing updates</a> to the watchOS 7 operating system. This problem seemed to be the small amount of storage space available on the Apple Watch Series 3 (the GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 3 only had 8GB storage). This means that there is not enough space for the temporary installation files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that instance, Apple suggested that users temporarily delete apps and music before updating. Alternatively, Apple recommended that users should restore the system completely before updating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi, plugged in, and charged enough</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Watch won’t update if it is less than 50% charged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also needs to be connected to Wi-Fi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, turn on Bluetooth if it’s off. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check it is compatible with the update</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the list of compatible Watches and iPhones above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also update your iPhone to the latest version of iOS, in the case of Apple Watch 10 you need iOS 17 installed on the partner iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Try updating via the iPhone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Apple Watch won’t update directly on the Watch itself, we recommend doing the update via the Watch app on the iPhone (as per the method above). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Restart your iPhone and Watch</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning them off and on again may fix the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Repair your Watch and iPhone </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may need to re-pair your Watch to your iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Watch app on the iPhone. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to My Watch and tap All Watches. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the i button beside the Watch you need to unpair. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose Unpair Apple Watch. (You need to choose to keep your mobile plan if you have a cellular watch). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your Apple ID password to disable Activation Lock. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>After the Apple Watch is wiped you will need to set it up again.
