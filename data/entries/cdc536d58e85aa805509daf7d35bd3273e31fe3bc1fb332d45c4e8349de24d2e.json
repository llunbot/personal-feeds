With a supremely usable touchscreen and buttons, peerless connectivity, data-rich interface, class-leading navigation, more than 35 hours battery life, and an attractive price, it’s the kind of cycling computer you’d be lost without. The most advanced – yet intuitive – cycling computer out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what makes it the instinctive choice for thousands of riders on road, gravel and beyond…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function and connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not often you can say there’s beauty in a product’s functionality, but the Karoo’s advanced, intuitive interface makes planning, performing and sharing rides a joy. Of course, it’s ANT+ compatible, allowing you to reliably connect heartrate monitors, power meters and the like, but where the Hammerhead unit goes above and beyond is in its sheer usability. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The fully customisable interface features a super-clear, smartphone-quality 3.2in Gorilla Glass touchscreen that’s a doddle to operate with fingertips, and which reacts to ambient light conditions. Maps and directions are never less than clear, regardless of how you customise the display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing full-finger gloves? Not a problem; the head unit’s features are also accessible with responsive side-mounted buttons. Riding for more than just the fun of it? The Karoo makes hitting training goals a cinch, with automatic syncing for TraningPeaks and TrainerRoad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The computer that listens</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond its inherent usability, one of the unique strengths of the Karoo is its bi-weekly software updates, regularly adding new features informed by real world user feedback, and its use by some of the planet’s most demanding pro riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This forward-thinking approach builds on, and benefits from, the strength of the Karoo community, demonstrating a thirst for improvement and a commitment to the head unit’s strengths on the road. Put simply, this computer packs the most agile software on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Joined-up thinking</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"712\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo.gif\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Hammerhead Karoo was designed alongside the all-new SRAM RED AXS electronic groupset – the knock-on benefit of Hammerhead now being part of the American component manufacturer’s portfolio of brands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practice, this means you can configure your wireless groupset – from shifters to chainrings – from the head unit of the Karoo. It offers quick and easy sign-on, automatic sensor pairing, and battery management, as well as – obviously – compatibility with other brands’ wireless groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Route to glory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the modern era of road riding, a cycling computer is nothing without navigation. And the Karoo has that covered like nothing else. Reliable, cycling-specific GPS-powered navigation ensures you never miss a turn, and you can ride safe in the knowledge that the head unit will present you with instant, automatic rerouting if your plans change. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/hammerhead-karoo-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Beeper notifications tell you when it’s time to turn, and even warn of approaching traffic.
