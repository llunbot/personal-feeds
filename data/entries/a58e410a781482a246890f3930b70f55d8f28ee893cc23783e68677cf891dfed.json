Having spent a fair share of their adult life in Lycra, it might seem outlandish to imagine a Tour de France stage winner or Paris-Roubaix champion donning a feather boa in the name of entertainment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reality TV soared during the 2000s thanks to shows like <em>Big Brother, Survivor</em> and<em> The X Factor</em>, celebrities were soon on the hit list to be involved in the format. Soon enough, cyclists were roped in and we enjoyed Tour de France stage winners fighting for stars in Bush Tucker Trials, Classics greats in the Big Brother Diary Room and Olympic gold medallists trying out ski jumping in the name of easy-viewing Saturday night TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as TV has waned in popularity, cyclists remain eager to compete in these competitions. Far from the grimness of the Tour de France, we’ve been treated to the likes of Wout van Aert and Nairo Quintana on a singing show in the past few years. Soon, three-time World Champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/peter-sagan-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Sagan</a> will join them as he takes part in the Slovakian version of <em>Strictly Come Dancing </em>(Let’s Dance).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In celebration of reality TV in all its silliness, we trawled through the archives to reveal every time a pro cyclist has featured on a TV reality competition show.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Richard Virenque: <em>Je suis une célibrité</em> (winner)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"629\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/10136243-richard-virenque-edited.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/10136243-richard-virenque-edited.webp 629w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/10136243-richard-virenque-edited-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/10136243-richard-virenque-edited-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/10136243-richard-virenque-edited-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/10136243-richard-virenque-edited-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only was Richard Virenque <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fix-king-of-the-mountains-polka-dot-jersey-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">King of the Mountains </a>at the Tour de France, but he was also King of the Jungle on the French version of<em> I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the French climber appeared in the first series of the show titled <em>Je suis une célebrité, sortez-moi de là</em>. During the 2006 series, Virenque – whose career was blighted by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/doping-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">the Festina Affair</a> – found his place in the jungle amid plenty of camp in-fighting, particularly in relation to racist remarks between some of the contestants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his 16 days in the Brazilian rainforest, the seven-time polka-dot jersey winner participated in nine Bush Tucker trials and was safe from elimination each day until the final on day 16. En route to the finale, he defeated Duke of Anjou Charles-Philippe d’Orléans and Olympic champion skier Marielle Goitschel to remain in the fight for the crown. By receiving more votes from the public than former boy band member Filip Nikolic, Virenque became the first winner of the show. The former Festina rider was awarded €50,000 for winning the show, but he gave that away to children’s charity Le chêne et le roseau.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t get too excited, he is, to our knowledge, the only cyclist to have <em>won</em> a reality TV competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+6\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-6-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Michael Rasmussen: <em>Vild med dans</em> (5th place)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/michael-rasmussen-dancing-970x591.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/michael-rasmussen-dancing-970x591.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/michael-rasmussen-dancing-300x183.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/michael-rasmussen-dancing-768x468.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/michael-rasmussen-dancing-750x457.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/michael-rasmussen-dancing-1140x694.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/michael-rasmussen-dancing.jpg 1240w\" /><figcaption>Jonas Vandall Ørtvig/ Scanpix Denmark</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remembered mostly for his turbulent 2009 Tour de France in which his Rabobank contract was terminated mid-way through the Tour while in the yellow jersey, Michael Rasmussen quickly became a household name in Denmark. Touted as the heir to Bjaarne Riis’s place on the Danish cycling throne, Rasmussen later admitted to doping during the 2007 Tour and served a two-year suspension after lying about his whereabouts to his team bosses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After serving his suspension, Rasmussen signed up for the Danish spin-off of the dancing show <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> known in Denmark as <em>Vild med dans </em>(Crazy about Dancing). By swapping cleats for dancing shoes, Rasmussen quickstepped (the dance, not the team) to Salt ‘N’ Pepa and even danced Samba to the Macarena. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside dancer Mie Moltke, he managed to survive seven weeks of the show before being voted off, finishing in a respectable fifth place. That said, he never lost his stoic facial expressions while on the dancefloor.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-watch-cycling-for-less-in-the-uk\">How to watch cycling for less in the UK</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-australia\">What would a three-week Tour of Australia look like?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-mascots\">Inside the weird and wonderful world of pro cycling mascots</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/weird-grand-tour-starts\">The weird and wonderful places to have hosted a Grand Tour stage</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-cycling-books\">The best cycling books 2025 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Nairo Quintana: <em>The Masked Singer</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nairo-quintana-caeloeon-970x568.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nairo-quintana-caeloeon-970x568.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nairo-quintana-caeloeon-300x176.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nairo-quintana-caeloeon-768x450.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nairo-quintana-caeloeon-750x439.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nairo-quintana-caeloeon-1140x668.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nairo-quintana-caeloeon.jpeg 1280w\" /><figcaption>RCN</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Masked Singer is a reality TV show unlike any other. The show, first tested out in South Korea, sees celebrities anonymously perform hit songs while dressed head-to-toe in the most outlandish fancy dress outfit imaginable. The format was a hit and was soon shipped across the world for international audiences to gawk at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 2021 series of the Colombian franchise, we were blessed by the dulcet tones of former Giro and Vuelta winner Nairo Quintana who performed J Balvin’s reggaeton song <em>RITMO, </em>which samples Corona’s hit 1990s track<em> Rhythm of the Night</em>. The diminutive, and often shy, climber was given the alter-ego of a baroque chameleon for the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a critic’s review of the performance, I’ll say this: he had as much trouble staying in tune as he often did in Tour de France time-trials. However, I’ve got to commend his dance moves and stage presence, which were somewhat surprising for a man who has often stayed away from the limelight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The episode aired in October 2021 but don’t worry, it was all pre-recorded and he didn’t miss any race days to don the chameleon outfit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wout van Aert: <em>The Masked Singer</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/wout-masked-singer-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"The Masked Singer; seizoen 4, aflevering 6 op vrijdag 25 oktober 2024 bij VTM.

In the most recent season of the hit show, we met another familiar face from the peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his identity obscured by a grand superhero-like squirrel outfit, Wout van Aert took on Blur’s anthemic number ‘Song 2’. With all the whoops required to pull this off, the squirrel was a remarkably decent singer with bags of stage presence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewers found out in one episode that the elusive figure was, in fact, a cyclist. This sparked plenty of talk, but in the following week’s instalment, it was revealed who was under that furry squirrel costume. Of course, it was none other than Van Aert. The Belgian made his cameo on the show before the Vuelta a España and before that gruesome knee injury suffered in the final week there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He later performed ‘Song 2’ once again at Visma-Lease a Bike’s training camp, much to his teammate’s joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bradley Wiggins: <em>The Jump (withdrew)</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file.webp 1080w\" /><figcaption>Channel 4</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2010s were littered with strange sports competition shows. Of course, Total Wipeout ruled the screens in the early 2010s before celebrities tried out platform diving and military training in the name of Saturday night TV. As part of this cultural wave, Channel 4 in the UK launched its wintery competition show titled <em>The Jump</em>. The show saw celebrities take to ski jumping among other winter sports. Sounds ideal for Primož Roglič, doesn’t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of his return to our screens, Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins took part in the show during its fourth and final series in 2017. While on the show, Wiggins tried out slalom skiing and skeleton, however his time on the show was short-lived. He was forced to exit the show after the third episode, meaning that he wasn’t even the best cyclist on the series, getting surpassed on the leaderboard by Paralympian Kadeena Cox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, Wiggins recovered after a couple of months and just three years later launched a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bradley-wiggins-to-debut-in-new-comedy-show-tonight\">comedy game show of his own</a> titled <em>Gods of the Game</em>.

The show, originally drawn up in the Netherlands, took off after a string of successful series that saw civilians live in a house together, held at the mercy of a public vote. The show reached infamy for its arguments, crazy tasks and dramatic twists and turns – including a foreign affairs incident between the UK and India during the fifth series of the British celebrity edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format was expanded to include celebrities instead of ordinary folk. During the first series of the celebrity edition in 2000, titled Big Brother VIP in the Netherlands, former pro cyclist Johan van der Velde participated. There were no public votes in the first series, but the Dutchman left his mark on the show having discussed his substance abuse during the week’s worth of shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The series was shipped over to neighbouring Belgium the year after and another former pro took part: Eddy Planckaert. The 1990 Paris-Roubaix victor lasted a week in the house before facing elimination at the hands of his housemates who voted him off. This wasn’t without a chance to show off his bike mechanic skills, which were put on display during day five’s task where the housemates had to build a bike together to secure a prize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical of Belgian cycling, Eddy’s nephew Jo took part in the show the following season. Almost a decade after finishing runner-up at Paris-Roubaix, Jo managed to become an influential figure in the house. By winning two tasks (one for fast reactions, the other a boxing match), the Belgian Classics rider was given the power to eliminate two of his housemates. Despite finishing last in a quiz task later in the show, Planckaert left the Big Brother House in second place behind singer Pim Symoens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lance Armstrong: <em>Stars on Mars</em> (8th place)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"739\" height=\"486\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lance-armstrong-stars-on-mars.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lance-armstrong-stars-on-mars.png 739w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lance-armstrong-stars-on-mars-300x197.png 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>American channel Fox launched an all-new reality show in 2023 titled<em> Stars on Mars</em>. As the name suggests, a group of celebrities were thrown into a Mars-like world where they would have to work together to survive a simulated space mission. Staying inside a stylised space station, the celebrities were put to their tests, performing tasks to ensure their ‘survival’ on Mars. In reality, this was all shot in the Australian desert and the space suits the stars were forced to wear were all cosmetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of its pilot season – and, to date, the only series – cycling’s most notorious doper <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lance-armstrong\">Lance Armstrong</a> was recruited as part of the cast, alongside a crew featuring the likes of Bruce Willis’s daughter, actress Ariel Winter and figure skater Adam Rippon. In the end, the former Discovery Channel rider was eliminated after nine episodes, achieving a mid-table finish in the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armstrong’s appearance caused quite a stir with local politicians who were unaware that the disgraced Texan would be competing. After having received a $1.5 million cheque from the South Australian Government to compete at the 2009 Tour Down Under, some Australian commentators hoped the former cyclist would stay well clear of the country. This fracture resurfaced when <em>Stars on Mars</em> started shooting. The show was funded by the Federal Government’s tax dollars and local officials soon apologised for funding Armstrong’s second Australian comeback when this came to light.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Claudio Chiappucci: <em>L’isola dei famosi</em> (2nd place)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/chiapucci.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Rai</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Claudio Chiappucci claimed a memorable stage win at the 1992 Tour de France in Sestriere. After slipping away into an early breakaway, the Italian took the stage and sewed up the polka-dot jersey while jumping up the GC rankings to second overall. He stayed on the podium until Paris, only to finish runner-up to five-time Tour winner <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/miguel-indurain-cyclist\">Miguel Induráin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After retiring, Chiappucci made an unlikely appearance on the fourth series of <em>L’isola dei famosi </em>(The Island of the Famous), Italy’s version of the American show <em>Survivor</em>. As a castaway, the Milan-San Remo winner arrived on a remote island in Honduras and became a favourite to win early on. He was nominated the camp leader for four weeks (which, according to our research, is a long time), but was eventually beaten to the trophy by actor Luca Calvani during the show’s finale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘After so many years of hard work on a bike, I wanted to test myself in a different but equally tough context,’ Chiappucci said in <a href=\"https://www.gazzetta.it/Ciclismo/Primo_Piano/2006/11_Novembre/09/chiappucci.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">an interview</a> during the final show. ‘I took part in a race and lost in the sprint.

Yep, that’s the company we’re dealing with here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partnered with Russian dancer Marina Aleksejva, Cipollini was off to a flying start, finishing in second place during the first week’s dance. Aleksejva’s father <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9YgKusvrbmo\" target=\"_blank\">uploaded the dance to YouTube</a>, which also includes Cipollini’s dance partner reading his <em>palmarès</em> from a copy of Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italian sprinter was soon in the dance-off, narrowly avoiding third-week elimination by just 2% of the public vote. His time soon ran out and he finished in seventh place (out of 12). Nevertheless, the serial Giro stage winner beat Maradona – though it’s worth noting that the legendary football player retired from the show after three episodes due to health reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Victoria Pendleton: Strictly Come Dancing (8th place)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2-1140x641.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pendleton-sctritly-2.webp 1600w\" /><figcaption>BBC</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back of British cycling’s <em>annus mirabilis</em> that included a British Tour win, a record medal haul on the track as well as a whopping 11 men’s Grand Tour stage wins, cycling catapulted itself into the public eye in 2012. As a talisman for this two-wheeled wave, Victoria Pendleton was signed up for <em>Strictly Come Dancing.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bedfordshire-born track specialist was paired up with Kiwi dancer Brendan Cole and together the duo went on a sharp upward trajectory. After a few shaky weeks, the nine-time World Champion Pendleton went from one of the weakest dancers to a confident performer. If you’re looking for a highlight, she was lowered from the roof on board a BMX bike during the opening of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UPwK_PaHT6w\" target=\"_blank\">her Paso Doble to Queen’s <em>Bicycle Race </em></a>during week seven of the show. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, she couldn’t pair a Strictly glitterball trophy with her two Olympic golds. She was eliminated after seven weeks, meaning she finished in eighth overall. That said, she has the best finish among the two British cyclists to take part in the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thomas Dekker: <em>Expeditie Robinson</em> (3rd place)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"750\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/dekker-survivor-v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/dekker-survivor-v2.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/dekker-survivor-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/dekker-survivor-v2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/dekker-survivor-v2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/dekker-survivor-v2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>RTL</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning to remote islands, the Swedish Survivor-esque show <em>Expedition Robinson</em> picked up traction in the late 1990s and was soon sold off to Dutch broadcasters in 2000. Titling their effort <em>Expeditie Robinson</em> – a reference to castaway novel Robinson Crusoe – the show sees celebrities and civilians live in tribes on a remote island in South East Asia. Contestants compete alongside their tribes in challenges before deciding who goes home through an Island Council ballot. Sounds good, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took over a decade for a pro cyclist to get involved in the Dutch show with Thomas Dekker making an appearance on the cast sheet in 2016. Making it through the tribal rounds, the former doper – who <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/thomas-dekkers-the-descent-book-review\">wrote a book about his time in the EPO-ridden peloton </a>– survived the Island Council ballots and made it to the final. The Dutchman eventually finished in third place behind winner Bertie Steur and rapper Dio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the former pro fared on the island, Dekker said he ‘kept thinking about the European Championship and the Tour de France’ while on the island. That’s understandable if you ask me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former Garmin-Sharp rider, who retired from the peloton in 2014, returned to the show in 2022 as part of<em> Expeditie Robinson’</em>s All Stars season. However, he would finish in eighth the second time round.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nicolas Roche:<em> Dancing with the Stars</em> (6th place)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/nico-roche-dancing.jpg 1280w\" /><figcaption>RTÉ</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-power-of-three-stephen-roche-profile\">Son of a Triple Crown winner</a> and a Grand Tour stage winner in his own right, Ireland’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/nico-roche-podcast\">Nicolas Roche</a> has been amassing an eclectic portfolio since retiring at the end of 2021.

Quite the feat if you ask me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other appearances</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jesper Skibby, <em>Vild med dans</em>, Denmark, 2005 (finished 4th)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ignazio Moser, <em>L’isola dei famosi</em>, Italy, 2021 (finished 4th)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Miguel Ángel Perdiguero, <em>Supervivientes</em>, Spain, 2010 (finished 7th)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nico Mattan, <em>Sterren op de Dansvloer</em>, Netherlands, 2008 (finished 8th)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ignazio Moser,<em> Grande Fratello VIP</em>, 2017 (finished 9th)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Peio Ruiz Cabestany,<em> La Selva de los FamoS.O.S</em>, Spain, 2004 (finished 4th last)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kadeena Cox, <em>Celebrity Farm</em>, UK, 2019 (finished 3rd last)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jody Cundy,<em> Strictly Come Dancing,</em> UK, 2023 (finished 2nd last)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anita Valen de Vries, <em>Skal Vi Danse?</em>, Noway, 2009 (finished last)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cyclists-on-reality-tv\">The best pro cyclist appearances on reality TV</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a58e410a781482a246890f3930b70f55d8f28ee893cc23783e68677cf891dfed","category":"Cycling"}
