It joins Factor’s range as the counterpoint to the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/factor-ostro-vam-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ostro VAM</a>, which is a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aero bike</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Factor says it gives the riders of its sponsored pro team, Israel Premier Tech, a fast option that is light enough to sit right on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-weight-limit\" target=\"_blank\">UCI weight limit</a> of 6.8kg <em>with</em> pedals, transponder and race number attached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sans</em> race trim, 6.2kg complete bikes (in size 54cm) are said to be achievable with conventional build kits thanks to the O2 VAM’s new 730g frame, which is made possible because of novel fabrication techniques used in Factor’s new purpose-built factory. The frame itself actually gains a little weight over the previous bike but now includes an integrated seat post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its still-extreme light weight, Factor says the new bike is 12 watts faster than its predecessor at 48kmh and 35% stiffer, courtesy of changes to tube profiles and in carbon layup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Factor also exploited the relaxation in the UCI’s rules governing tube profiles to slim down areas such as the top tube. In combination with an integrated seat post, this reportedly allowed Factor to increase the frame’s compliance – there is now 10mm of movement at the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conjunction with the O2 VAM frameset, Black Inc, Factor’s components brand, has introduced 28//33 tubeless clincher wheelset. It uses variable rim depths and carbon spokes to achieve a claimed weight of just 1,146g, despite <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\" target=\"_blank\">rim widths</a> being a generous 23/28mm internally/externally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The O2 VAM and Black Inc 28//33 wheelset are both available immediately from factorbikes.com. The frameset is available in three colour options and prices range from £9,900 / €9,499 / $9,899 / AU$15,990 to £12,200 / €11,699 / $12,199 / AU$19,690. A frameset only option costs £6,300 / €6,049 /$6,299 / AU$9,990.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Factor’s genesis</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"factor_01_review_1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/03215243/factor_01_review_1.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Released in 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/factor-o2-review\" target=\"_blank\">O2</a> was the first bike Factor produced after owner Rob Gitelis bought the company from bf1systems, as a UCI-legal alternative to the radical Vis Vires bike he inherited with the company.

impressive gains made in the aerodynamic efficiency stakes – Factor says, on average across a +/-15 degree yaw sweep, the new bike is 12 watts faster at 48kmh than the old version – the features that create that advantage are relatively subtle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Couched within the bounds of light weight shapes, we use aggressively truncated aerofoil profiles on areas such as the head tube, down tube and seatstays, which manipulates the separation and reattachment of the airflow across the bike,’ says Graham Shrive, Factor’s director of engineering. ‘We’ve been able to refine how we manage airflow thanks to the development of the Ostro VAM and Ostro Gravel, where we’ve done the same thing.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new O2 VAM also adopts the Ostro VAM’s tapered head tube, which doesn’t use an oversize lower bearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It uses a 1.25in lower bearing so that the frontal profile of the O2 VAM’s headtube can remain small,’ says Gitelis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

Gitelis says creates marked improvement is the seat tube profile, which is exceptionally wide laterally at its base, despite being narrow in profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Together with the refinement of some seriously exotic materials, such as Toray’s T1000 and M60J carbon fibres, boron and Textreme, we’ve been able to boost stiffness by 35% over the old O2 VAM, bringing it up to the level of the Ostro VAM,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to the gains made in stiffness and aerodynamics, the design solutions chosen to improve compliance while retain the O2 VAM’s lightweight credentials are altogether more conspicuous, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

This keeps the trail figure the same across the range, so no matter the size, the bike will ride the same.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stack height has also been raised by a centimetre, as Shrive says Factor has had feedback that riders commonly use spacers under the stem due to the old bikes aggressive stack, plus riders tend to prefer a more upright position while climbing, which is what the O2 VAM is designed for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Investment, research and development</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Factor O2 VAM 2023 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gitelis says the development cycle of the new bike is an excellent example of how vertically integrated Factor is. FEA, CFD, industrial design, wind tunnel testing, fabrication and finishing is all done in-house, with rider feedback and road testing done within Factor’s sponsored pro team too. The O2 VAM has taken things one step further though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The development of the O2 VAM coincided with substantial investment in Factor’s manufacturing facilities, so we basically made a new factory for this new bike,’ says Gitelis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The manufacturing facilities that Factor owns have long been the R&amp;D centre for the bike industry, but I’ve found that the processes that we’ve developed have often been duplicated elsewhere within a year or two, so we’ve just built a new factory in Taiwan.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is in a bid to protect Factor’s intellectual property much more closely, as well as simplify the development phase of each bike project. The rate of prototype iteration has reportedly moved from three weeks to one day. Gitelis says there isn’t another brand in the industry that has that ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new facility adds another layer of vertical integration to Factor that reportedly is of huge benefit to the final product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Case in point we’ve developed a new composite compaction method, which is secret and proprietary,’ says Shrive. ‘We’re not reinventing the process, just making each step that little bit better. Approaches like this are what have allowed us to produce the bike we have in the O2 VAM.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Inc 28//33 wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Factor O2 VAM 2023 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/factor_O2_VAM_2023_news-16.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Every Factor bike launch is accompanied by a supporting Black Inc product release, which is available on the corresponding bikes but also aftermarket too,’ says Gitelis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Black Inc 28//33 wheels are in the spotlight on this occasion, which effectively replace the pre-existing Black Inc Thirty wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The front and rear wheel use differing rim depths,’ says Shrive. ‘This lets the rear wheel generate a little less drag, while the front wheel saves weight and improves handling by being shallower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘However, the thing to really get excited about is that we’ve dropped 300g from the weight of the wheelset. 1,146g for the pair is industry leading, particularly considering they have a mini-hook rim wall and a 23mm internal width. Their profile has been designed around 28mm (measured width) <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless</a> tyres.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shrive says the Black Inc has not only made the rims lighter, but also stronger, claiming the rims test at least three times higher than the UCI minimum impact test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They also use an offset rim, to create better spoke triangulation for higher lateral stiffness,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping in the stiffness stakes as well as reducing weight is the inclusion of carbon spokes, which Shrive says will become a more common feature in Black Inc wheels along with the variable rim profiles that the 28//33 wheels debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Factor O2 VAM range overview</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Factor O2 VAM bikes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/FotoJet-1.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Factor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The O2 VAM will be available in three standard finishes – a storm grey, red velvet and raw carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ll always offer raw carbon because the frame we get out of the mould requires nearly no finishing at all, so we want to show our fabrication quality off,’ says Gitelis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to Factor painting its bikes in house, its ‘Prisma Studio’ custom paint option is also available on the O2 VAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The O2 VAM will be offered in seven sizes.
