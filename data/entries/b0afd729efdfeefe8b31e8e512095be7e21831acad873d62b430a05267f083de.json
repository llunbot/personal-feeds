A solarium is a room with glass walls that allow in plenty of sunlight, so this codename further hints at iOS 19 having a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-visionos-like-design-rumors/\">\"glass-like\" appearance</a> with translucent interfaces. The new design is expected to look similar to visionOS for the Apple Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJon Prosser has shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/\">alleged renders of iOS 19's Camera</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-messages-app-mockup/\">Messages apps</a> on his YouTube channel Front Page Tech, and both apps have more translucent designs. However, there is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/gurman-ios-19-mockups-not-accurate/\">some debate over the extent of the design changes</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman previously claimed that iOS 19 could have the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/\">biggest design changes since iOS 7</a> introduced a much flatter appearance in 2013.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's annual developers conference WWDC <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/\">returns on Monday, June 9 this year</a>. The first iOS 19 beta should be made available to developers for testing immediately following the opening keynote that day, and the software update should be released to the general public in September.
