But it’s even better when it’s down to an all-time-low price: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular/dp/B09G9FPHY6/&amp;xcust=1-1-2031872-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 64GB iPad for $250</a>, a savings of $79 and matching the best price we’ve ever seen for this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9th-gen iPad has a 10.2-inch retina display, A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage support. It’s the only remaining iPad to feature Apple’s classic design with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Home button but is still plenty capable and more than ready for iPadOS 17 in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you need a great tablet for back to school or just hanging around the house, go grab this deal before the price goes back up.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3b9ddcfaa36a7ac80845118946ee3239f3f17aa3f4ebdb21ffecb53e7176a57a","category":"Apple"}
