But Goodwin, an epidemiologist and medical oncologist treating breast cancer at the University of Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital, advises against it. No gold-standard trials have proved that metformin helps treat breast cancer—and her recent research suggests it doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Metformin’s development was inspired by centuries of use of French lilac, or goat’s rue (<em>Galega officinalis</em>), for diabetes-like symptoms. In 1918, researchers discovered that a compound from the herb lowers blood sugar. Metformin, a chemical relative of that compound, has been a top type 2 diabetes treatment in the United States since it was approved in 1994. It’s cheap—<a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/metformin\">less than a dollar per dose</a>—and readily available, with few side effects. Today, more than 150 million people worldwide take the stuff.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/why-a-diabetes-drug-fell-short-of-anticancer-hopes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/why-a-diabetes-drug-fell-short-of-anticancer-hopes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Amber Dance, Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e2d71d390c15a190b5f8a2d9b76c2eb6f84fe81a0ea34ec9be9ffc24252cb83","category":"Tech"}
