As such, boosters will be rolled out based on the order in which people were initially offered vaccines, i.e., with frontline health workers, nursing home residents, and other seniors at the front of the line.</p>\n<p>US officials are prepared to begin offering booster shots the week of September 20. However, the timing of the boosters is pending authorization from the Food and Drug Administration and the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent committee of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788293#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788293&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"75d4236df73c87524e6e3a8cbc09c4f71e9e1be61d657d9e6230b1d3a2094f33","category":"Tech"}
