There are 24 oxidizer valves in the propulsion system, which is critical both for in-space travel as well as launch emergency escapes. During investigations on the launch pad, technicians were able to open some but not all of the valves.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797244#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dafae6f9a41ce2ade91116d9a7e6b522143b5309f945d0bbcf01777d0d5f0411","category":"Tech"}
