The online game that launched to a negative reception with no NPCs but plenty of bugs has mutated in new directions since its 2018 debut. Now it’s finding new life thanks to the wildly popular <em>Fallout</em> TV series that debuted a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>In truth, it never died, though it has stayed in decidedly niche territory for the past six years. Developer Bethesda Game Studios has released regular updates fixing (many of) the bugs, adding new ways to play, softening the game’s rough edges, and yes, introducing <em>Fallout 3-</em> or <em>Fallout 4</em>-like, character-driven quest lines with fully voiced NPCs—something many players felt was missing in the early days.</p>\n<p>It’s still not for everybody, but for a select few of us who’ve stuck with it, there’s nothing else quite like it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019560#p3\">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019560&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5abccff09225a7acc612e531e9b96813a150475d72b611ebf8bd83fb91ebfdb4","category":"Tech"}
