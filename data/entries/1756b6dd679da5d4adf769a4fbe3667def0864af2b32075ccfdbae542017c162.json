As The<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/business/samsung-first-strike-chips.html\"> New York Times</a> reports, Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) has about 28,000 members, or about one-fifth of Samsung's workforce, walking out of the job on Friday. It's Samsung's first-ever workers' strike.</p>\n<p>Specifically the walkout is in Samsung's chip division, which makes RAM, NAND flash chips, USB sticks and SD cards, Exynos processors, camera sensors, modems, NFC chips, and power and display controllers. Depending on how each quarter goes, Samsung is often the world's largest chipmaker by revenue thanks to this division, and its parts are in products from a million different brands. It's probably hard to find a tech product that doesn't have some kind of Samsung chip in it.</p>\n<p>As you'd expect, the union wants higher pay. Samsung's workers have gotten as much as 30 percent of their pay from bonuses, and there were no bonuses last year. UnionVP Lee Hyun Kuk told the Times that “it feels like we’ve taken a 30 percent pay cut.” The average pay for a union member is around $60,000 before bonuses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029811#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029811&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1756b6dd679da5d4adf769a4fbe3667def0864af2b32075ccfdbae542017c162","category":"Tech"}
