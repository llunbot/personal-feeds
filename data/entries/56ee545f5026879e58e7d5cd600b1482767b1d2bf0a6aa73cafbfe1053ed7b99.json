The test of the rocket's six engines appeared to be nominal as the Raptors ignited for a handful of seconds. The rocket and ground support equipment looked undamaged after the test.</p>\n<p>Also this week SpaceX rolled the booster to be used for the next attempt—Booster 10—to the launch site at its Starbase facility in South Texas. The vehicle has since been lifted onto the orbital launch mount. Presumably this rocket, too, will undergo a static fire test in the coming days.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992407#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992407&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56ee545f5026879e58e7d5cd600b1482767b1d2bf0a6aa73cafbfe1053ed7b99","category":"Tech"}
