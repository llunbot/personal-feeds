{"title":"TV Technica 2024: Our picks for the best of TV","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/tv-technica-2024-our-picks-for-the-best-of-tv/","date":1735041607000,"content":"<p><em><strong>Editor's note</strong>: Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed shows that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>\n<p>This was another good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Really, 2024 had a little of everything, from wacky crime capers (<em>Bad Monkey</em>) and Satanic Panic (<em>Hysteria</em>) to dystopian video game adaptations (<em>Fallout</em>) and sweeping historical epics (<em>Shōgun)</em>, with plenty of genre-mashup delights in between. While streaming platforms continue to dominate, the selection is more evenly distributed across them this year, with only Hulu and Netflix snagging more than two slots (depending on whether or not you lump Hulu together with Disney+ after the merger).</p>\n<p>As always, we're opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our \"year's best\" vote at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/tv-technica-2024-our-picks-for-the-best-of-tv/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/tv-technica-2024-our-picks-for-the-best-of-tv/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d632be7c0261ebceb08025568416d6769a73f90fad1c4d95fe4a28c428449429","category":"Tech"}
