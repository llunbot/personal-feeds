A multi-billion dollar deal between Apple and Google sees that Google is set as the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week the trial revealed that Microsoft considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/\">selling</a> its Bing search engine to Apple. Had the acquisition happened, Bing would have replaced Google as the default search engine on Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's services chief ‌Eddy Cue‌ also had to testify, and he <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/\">explained</a> why Google is the ‌iPhone‌'s default search engine. \"We make Google be the default search engine because we've always thought it was the best,\" Cue said. He went on to say that Apple has not gone with another search engine provider because there is no \"valid alternative.\"\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/set-default-search-engine-safaris-private-browsing/\">How to Set a Different Default Search Engine When Private Browsing in Safari</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nWhile Google is the default search engine on Apple devices, users can choose to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia as an alternative. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/\">Apple Privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/\">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-considered-duckduckgo-default-private-search/\">Apple Considered Making DuckDuckGo Default Search Engine in Safari Private Browsing Mode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considered-making-duckduckgo-default-search-engine-in-safari-private-browsing-mode.2406400/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"340b4dcc781bb403a84a2d7e4f00926430b4ead06dcff2cefe40b77dfdcbef92","category":"Apple"}
