The company tends to hold a March or April <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-2023-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring event</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> in June, an event to celebrate the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">iPhone launch in September</a>, and a late fall event in October at which it has been known to release new iPads and Macs. The company has even held an event as late as November 10 (in 2020 when it unveiled the first batch of M1 Macs). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple just introduced the new iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 at an event on September 12. Has the company finished releasing new products for 2023? There is still a chance we could see the launch of new Macs and iPads at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple event</a> in October, but it is possible that Apple will not hold an event to introduce any more <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new products</a> in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updated: October 23, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman thinks there could be an Apple event on 30 or 31 October… But, we don’t think that is very likely. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will Apple hold another event in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years Apple has held a second fall event in October or November, where it has launched new Macs, iPads, and AirPods. For example, at the 2021 Unleashed event we got the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the third-gen AirPods, while the previous year brought the M1 versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini on Tuesday, November 10. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as you can see from the list of October event dates below, Apple does not always hold an October event. Over the past 12 years, Apple has held eight October events, so it’s not unprecedented to skip it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2022: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 13 and Tuesday, November 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Thursday, October 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: Thursday, October 16</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: Tuesday, October 22</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Tuesday, October 23</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2011: Tuesday, October 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In his October 22, 2023 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p&amp;xcust=1-1-1064916-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">weekend newsletter</a> Bloomberg’s Michael Gurman indicated that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2113582/m3-mac-event-imac-macbook-pro-october.html\">Apple could hold an event on 30 or 31 October</a>. This would be a few days before the company announces its quarter four financial results (on November 2). A 31 October event seems very unlikely given that it is Halloween. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we think 2023 will not be a year in which Apple will hold an October event or even a November event. While there is a possibility that the company could launch a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini</a> and an M3 version of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">iMac</a> and MacBook Pro, both of which have at some point been rumored for this year, neither would warrant the attention of an event. It is more likely that any Apple product updates still to come in 2023 will do so in the form of a press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When could Apple’s October/November event be held?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually gives at least two week’s notice of an event, so an October event is now very unlikely, despite what Gurman said. If Apple instead holds an event in November it might happen around November 7 or 14. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that is the case expect invitations to the event to arrive around the end of October. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most likely Apple will issue a press release with the news, probably on 31 October as Gurman suggests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we think <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2103176/apple-mac-fall-event-macbook-m3-press-releases.html\">Apple may never hold another fall Mac event ever again</a>…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple has a second fall event, we know for sure that it will start at 10 am PT. Here’s what that translates to in other countries around the world. However, the clocks change on different dates around the world, so the time could be an hour earlier/later in some locations if the clocks haven’t changed by then. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>US: 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), 12 pm (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: As above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UK: 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: 7 pm (CET/CEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Following day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: Following day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s special events usually last between one and two hours. If you want to watch the October event live, Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">stream the keynote</a> on its website and YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will Apple launch in October/November?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether there’s an event or not, it is possible that Apple could unveil new Macs and iPads. In fact, there are a number of reports predicting that it will do so before the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M3 iMac </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iMac is still running an M1 chip while the rest of the lineup is now on the second generation of Apple’s Mac chips, so it’s well overdue an update. The rumors suggest that the iMac will move straight to the M3 chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">M3 iMac rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>13-inch MacBook Pro with M3 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may also be set to update the 13-inch MacBook Pro at the same time as the iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac mini with M3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac mini may also get an update to M3, or this may wait until 2024, with the Mac mini Pro simultaneously getting an update to M3 Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Air with M3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggested that the MacBook Air could get an M3 update this year. This seemed unlikely given the fact that the 15-inch model was only introduced in June. It now looks like Apple may update both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air in the spring of 2024, but it is possible we will see something sooner.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini was last updated in 2021. A seventh-generation model is said to be coming in 2023 with a better chip and screen improvements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not the only new iPad coming though. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2096970/ipad-mini-air-pro-rumors-specs-processor-upgrades.html\">Apple has ‘multiple new iPads’ in the works</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad Air </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new iPad Air could also be coming before the end of the year, with an update to the M2 from the M1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad 11th gen </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard iPad may also get a chip upgrade. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bigger iPad Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There could also be a new iPad Pro, with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro</a> rumored, however, this isn’t expected until 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods Lite</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AirPods Lite have been rumored for some time. Said to cost $99 they could be huge this Christmas, if they ever emerge. The AirPods Max also need an update. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What did Apple launch at its last October event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 18, 2021, Apple launched redesigned models of the high-end MacBook Pro, with a 14-inch and 16-inch models making their debut. Powering the new MacBooks were the high-end M1 Pro and M1 Max chips that built on the already impressive M1 chips that arrived in November 2020. The laptops received new designs with slim bezels and extra ports, including MagSafe, HDMI, and an SD card slot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That event also saw Apple unveil the third-generation AirPods, new HomePod mini colors, and a cheaper, Siri-powered Apple Music subscription, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678309/apple-music-voice-plan-vs-apple-music-the-differences.html\">Apple Music Voice</a>.
