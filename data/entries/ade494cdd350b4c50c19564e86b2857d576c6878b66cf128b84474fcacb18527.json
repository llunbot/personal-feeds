The intent is to demonstrate aurally, through a well-known popular tune, the impact of climate change by providing a snapshot of the devastation and destruction of extreme storms.</p>\n<p>“Historically, scientific data has normally been conveyed visually, as charts or illustrations,\" <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/sea-shanty-and-storm-data-collide-in-new-project-demonstrating-impacts-of-climate-crisis\">said Richard Thompson</a>, director of the University of Plymouth's Marine Institute, which collaborated with the university's Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research (ICCMR) on the project. \"However, the combination of sound and images provides significantly more alternatives to convey information. 'Song of the Sea' is a novel way of using actual climate data in such a way that it controls the music. And with extreme natural events predicted to increase in frequency and ferocity, there is no barrier to its principles being applied to represent the far-reaching effects of climate change on our planet.”</p>\n<p>Back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2015/feb/09/slime-mould-and-researcher-set-to-play-piano-duet\">in 2015</a>, Eduardo Miranda, a Brazilian composer who heads ICCMR, designed <a href=\"https://www.labnews.co.uk/article/2026424/eduardo_miranda_and_musical_slime_mould\">a musical biocomputer</a>, which  translated the electrical energy generated by the slime mold's movement into sound to compose \"music.\" He even performed a \"duet\" with the single-celled organism at a biomusic festival. Miranda also <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/computer-interface-helps-disabled-patients\">developed a a Brain Computer Music Interface</a> (BCMI), which enabled patients at the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability in London to interact with a string quartet through brainwave signals detected by electrodes placed on the scalp.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810435#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810435&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ade494cdd350b4c50c19564e86b2857d576c6878b66cf128b84474fcacb18527","category":"Tech"}
