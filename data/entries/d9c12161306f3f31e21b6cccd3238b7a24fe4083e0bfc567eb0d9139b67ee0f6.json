While the Rivian app was able to sense a user approaching and unlock the car, it was slow to work and not as accurate or as simple as ‌Car Keys‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRivian has added Ultra Wideband technology to its new vehicles for improved accuracy.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Use your phone or smartwatch to automatically lock or unlock doors when you're nearby. Accessing your vehicle is easier than ever -- thanks to ultrawideband technology enabled by the wallet feature on iOS and Android.</blockquote>\r<br />\nRivian says that ‌Car Keys‌ feature can be used with the R1S and R1T for unlocking and starting their vehicles, plus sharing digital keys with family and friends.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with ‌Car Keys‌, the updated Rivian models also feature Connect+, a streaming service that provides access to over 3,000 apps, including music services. Rivian says that it worked with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> team to \"deeply integrate\" ‌Apple Music‌ into Rivian's Connect+ platform. Customers can access ‌Apple Music‌'s more than 100 million songs, and with Rivian Premium Audio, ‌Apple Music‌ Spatial Audio is supported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore information on the upgraded vehicles can be <a href=\"https://rivian.com\">found on Rivian's website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/\">Car Keys</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/rivian-car-keys-support/\">Rivian's Latest Vehicles Support Apple Car Keys for Unlocking With Wallet App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rivians-latest-vehicles-support-apple-car-keys-for-unlocking-with-wallet-app.2428313/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d9c12161306f3f31e21b6cccd3238b7a24fe4083e0bfc567eb0d9139b67ee0f6","category":"Apple"}
