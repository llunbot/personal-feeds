The state-imposed restrictions were repealed in an <a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=senate&amp;f=Sf4097&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2024\">omnibus commerce policy bill</a> signed on Tuesday by Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat.</p>\n<p>Minnesota was previously <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/isp-lobby-has-already-won-limits-on-public-broadband-in-20-states/\">one of about 20 states</a> that imposed significant restrictions on municipal broadband. The <a href=\"https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks\">number</a> can differ depending on who's <a href=\"https://www.localnetchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CLIC-List-State-Barriers-7-1-21.pdf\">counting</a> because of disagreements over what counts as a significant restriction. But the list has gotten smaller in recent years because states including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/gop-plan-for-broadband-competition-would-ban-city-run-networks-across-us/#:~:text=Republicans%20in%20the-,Arkansas,-State%20Legislature.%20Baller\">Arkansas</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/colorado-kills-law-that-made-it-harder-for-cities-to-offer-internet-service/\">Colorado</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/victory-for-municipal-broadband-as-wash-state-lawmakers-end-restrictions/\">Washington</a> repealed laws that hindered municipal broadband.</p>\n<p>The Minnesota bill enacted this week <a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF4097&amp;version=latest&amp;session=ls93&amp;session_year=2024&amp;session_number=0#:~:text=Any%20municipality%20shall%20have%20the%20right%20to%20own%20and%20operate%20a%20telephone%20exchange\">struck down</a> a requirement that municipal telecommunications networks be approved in an election with 65 percent of the vote.
