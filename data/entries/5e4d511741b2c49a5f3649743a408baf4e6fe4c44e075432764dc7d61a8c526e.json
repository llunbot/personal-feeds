To that last point, we were suitably boggled at the recent news that Roberts Space Industries is now offering <a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Packages/Legatus-2953\">aÂ  $48,000 \"Legatus Pack\"</a> as a \"perfect collection\" of \"all ships released and concepted through [in-universe year] 2953.\"</p>\n<p>The collection of 187 ships (and hundreds of accessories like paint colors, skins, armor, and in-game posters) is now roughly two-thirds of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2023/demo/p60-279.html\">the median annual household income in the US</a> (circa 2022). But that price isn't even available to lookie-loos like you and me; to add the package to an online shopping cart, you must first <a href=\"https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002542733-Concierge-Levels-and-Rewards\">spend at least $1,000 to become a member of the game's Chairman's Club</a>.</p>\n<h2>What a bargain!</h2>\n<p>While the newest Legatus Pack launched in late December, the offering isn't a new concept for developer Roberts Space Industries. The first Legatus Pack <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/30/17411226/star-citizen-legatus-pack-bundle\">launched in May 2018 for a <em>relatively</em> reasonable $27,000</a>. Before that, similar \"Completionist\" packs of all in-game content released up to that point would run players up to $15,000.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994022#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994022&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e4d511741b2c49a5f3649743a408baf4e6fe4c44e075432764dc7d61a8c526e","category":"Tech"}
