With this, I’ve had a primer on how tech has evolved since my last dalliances with mountain biking.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are the three trends in MTB tech I welcome with open arms. And, in the name of balance, three I loathe…</p>\n\n<h2>3 things I love about modern MTBs</h2>\n<h3>1. Tyre clearances are more generous than ever</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Marlin 8 against a snowy backdrop\" title=\"Trek Marlin 8\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> More tyre clearance is almost always a good thing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>I tested a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/bianchi-methanol-9-5-cv-long-term-review/\">Bianchi Methanol</a> back in 2017. There was a lot to like about the XC bike, but the 2.1in rear-tyre clearance severely limited its potential. The Methanol wasn’t alone: many mountain bikes had miniscule tyre clearance.</p>\n<p>Mercifully, things have moved on since I was a wee content grub and modern <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country bikes</a> now have ample tyre clearance.</p>\n<p>For example, the recently-ish released <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/pivot-les-sl-29-pro-xt-xtr-review/\">Pivot Les SL</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/merida-big-nine-10k/\">Merida Big.Nine</a> will easily accommodate 2.4in-wide tyres mounted to 30mm-wide rims.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale Moterra Neo Carbon LT2 full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Cannondale Moterra Neo Carbon LT2 - Rear tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2.6in tyres are commonly seen on enduro and trail bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For gnarlier riders, many trail and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro bikes</a> can now accommodate tyres up to 2.6in wide.</p>\n<p>Provided you nail your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/trail-tech-mountain-bike-tyre-pressure-all-you-need-to-know/\">tyre pressures</a> and choose the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">best mountain bike tyre</a> for your riding, wider tyres can improve control and comfort in rough terrain.</p>\n<p>There’s still a place for narrower tyres, but I’d rather have the option to go wider – versatility is always a good thing, which leads me neatly to my next point.</p>\n<h3>2. Mounts, glorious mounts</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Lux World Cup against a tree\" title=\"BR_08930\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Two bottle cages on a full-suspension mountain bike? Hallelujah!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The proliferation of accessory mounts on mountain bikes is a good thing for all riders.</p>\n<p>It is now common for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">hardtails</a> to feature three <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bottle-cages/\">bottle cage</a> mounts. Shredding is thirsty work!</p>\n<p>Bike designers have also finally realised the need to hydrate doesn’t vanish when you ride a full-suspension mountain bike.</p>\n<p>Most brands go to lengths to ensure two bottles can fit inside the front triangle or, at least, provide a secondary mount on the underside of the down tube.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fairlight Holt dropout detail\" title=\"Fairlight Holt dropout detail\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mounts aren’t limited to budget bikes – the boutique Fairlight Holt, for example, includes provisions to mount mudguards and racks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fairlight</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-750/\">Budget hardtails</a> frequently feature rack and mudguard mounts. These may sit as an unused vestigial nub during a bike’s shredding days, but they could be used when a bike is <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/hardtail-to-super-commuter/\">put out to pasture and repurposed as a commuter</a>.</p>\n<p>Or you could fit a rack to your mountain bike and go touring on this rather than building a whole other bike. Versatility is good!</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida Big.Trail 600 trail mount\" title=\"Merida Big.Trail 600 trail mount\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bonus accessory mounts are useful.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Mountain bikes also commonly feature mounts for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-multi-tool/\">multi-tools</a> or pumps, usually on the underside of the top tube. It’s much harder to leave these at home if they’re strapped to your bike.</p>\n<p>Some bikes take this to a silly extreme (the warty appearance of the over-accessorised Surly Karate Monkey springs to mind), but overall, it’s a welcome trend.</p>\n<h3>3. Dropper posts are now the norm</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dropper post best list\" title=\"Dropper post best list\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It wasn’t long ago that dropper post routing wasn’t standard across all mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Even if they don’t come with one as stock, most modern mountain bikes can fit an internally routed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a>.</p>\n<p>A dropper post moves your saddle out of the way, for improved control and comfort on technical descents.</p>\n<p>I’m more leg than man, so I don’t mind a bit of old-school high posting for XC riding. But it’s reassuring to know any mountain bike I am likely to test could accommodate a dropper should I wish to go full send.</p>\n<h2>3 things I hate about modern MTBs</h2>\n<h3>1. 35mm bars are pointless and I hate them and they’re stupid</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope Carbon bar 35mm for mountain bikes\" title=\"Hope Carbon bar 35mm-6\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 35mm bars are a crime.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>35mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-handlebars/\">mountain bike handlebars</a> are purported to be stiffer for reduced weight, compared to a 31.8mm bar.</p>\n<p>First appearing on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a>, 35mm bars are now seen on all types of mountain bikes (and even some road bikes).</p>\n<p>I had no position on 35mm handlebars until I went to fit an out-front bike computer mount to a test bike.</p>\n<p>I’d obviously left this to the last minute and swore the room blue as I realised not one of my mounts would fit the bike.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Strive CFR testing at Bike Park Wales\" title=\"Canyon Strive CFR testing at Bike Park Wales\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Here is a photo of a rider schralping through a gnarly turn and – shock! – he’s doing so on 31.8mm bars without disastrous consequences.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>And what if I’d wanted to swap the stock stem for one of the dozen 31.8mm stems in my shed?! Augh – this stuff drives me mad. It’s pointless obsolescence of the worst order.</p>\n<p>The fact I’d already ridden the bike three or four times before this incident and not realised it was a 35mm bar says all you need to know: I refuse to believe there is a discernible difference in ride quality between 31.8mm and 35mm bars.</p>\n<p>Any weight savings will be vanishingly small in the context of a full bike. And unless it’s designed to be especially stiff, the ride quality of a 35mm bar should be the same as a 31.8mm bar.</p>\n<p>Some will disagree with me (this is the internet, after all) and cite the increased steering accuracy offered by 35mm, but I call nonsense.</p>\n<p>I’ve ridden immovably stiff 31.8mm bars that would satisfy the most turgid masochist, and they didn’t even weigh appreciably more than a more compliant bar.</p>\n<p>I despise 35mm bars and will not be convinced otherwise.</p>\n<h3>2. Modern press-fit bottom brackets are fine, but nobody wants one</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Removing and fitting a press-fit BB mountain bike\" title=\"Removing Fit Prees-Fit bb 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Press-fit BBs aren’t as bad as many make out, but there’s no denying consumers generally prefer to see threaded shells on new bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jonny Ashelford/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Press-fit bottom bracket shells are, in theory, a mechanically <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/press-fit-bottom-brackets-are-better/\">superior solution to a threaded shell</a>, but few rejoice when a new bike features a press-fit bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>Press-fit bottom brackets were first widely adopted in the early 2010s. Confusing standards, dodgy manufacturing tolerances, intangible benefits and poor communication from brands soon left a sour taste in the mouths of many riders.</p>\n<p>While things have improved dramatically, some issues remain. Even the most proficient mechanic will concede it’s quicker to fit or rectify any issues with a threaded <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> than a press-fit one.</p>\n<p>All of this means riders generally prefer to see threaded bottom brackets.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Epic bottom bracket.\" title=\"Specialized Epic bottom bracket\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Threaded bottom brackets are a marketing coup.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>But regardless of your stance, marketers reading this should tread carefully if engineers at your brand insist on press-fit.</p>\n<p>Specialized’s move back to threaded bottom bracket shells was heralded as a win for riders and mechanics.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz has also stuck with threaded bottom brackets forever and I challenge you to find one comment requesting a move to press-fit BBs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you will find far fewer supporting voices for press-fit than the good old threaded bottom bracket.</p>\n<h3>3. Integrated cable routing needs to be stopped</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2023 Scott Scale RC SL hardtail cross country mountain bike\" title=\"2023 Scott Scale RC SL hardtail cross country mountain bike-18\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You might think this looks cool, but it doesn’t make your bike any better.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I have little issue with routing cables through a frame. Provided it’s well designed, stuffing a cable into a down tube is less traumatic than you may expect.</p>\n<p>However, many new mountain bikes feature fully integrated front ends with cables routed through (or under) the bar and into the head tube.</p>\n<p>This trend makes mountain bikes more complicated and less user-friendly with no performance benefit.</p>\n<p>So why have integrated front ends proliferated?</p>\n<p>While I couldn’t give a fig about such small gains, on road bikes, fully integrated front ends are claimed to reduce drag.</p>\n<p>I challenge any designer to look me in the eye and say the aero improvements of hidden cables on a mountain bike will make you any faster without smirking.</p>\n<p>Internal cable routing can make it easier to mount <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a>. But, if we’re being honest, this isn’t why brands opt to hide cable routing in the bar and frame, is it?</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, the only reason internal cable routing has become popular is because some riders and brands like the way it looks.</p>\n<p>While it’s fine to want your bike to look good, it shouldn’t come at the expense of easy maintenance. Just stop.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9e360e96454f775e6b9ea2626043a9aeac92e1d8c54ecfa69779c2f492393521","category":"Cycling"}
