Prices will be going up for the Basic and Premium plans in those three countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-3.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nIn the United States, the price of the Basic plan will increase from $9.99 to $11.99 per month, while the price of the Premium plan will increase from $19.99 to $22.99 per month. The ad-supported tier price will remain the same at $6.99 per month, as will the $15.49/month Standard plan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix no longer offers the Basic plan to new subscribers in the United States, but prices will presumably increase for existing subscribers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Premium Netflix plan is the only plan that provides access to 4K video streaming and spatial audio. The $15.49 Standard plan and the ad-supported plan are limited to 1080p.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix announced the price hikes in its earnings call for the third quarter of 2023 [<a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/FINAL-Q3-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">PDF</a>], which took place today.

Revenue came in at $8.54 billion, up from $7.9 billion last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSubscriber growth comes after Netflix began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/netflix-password-crackdown-subscriber-increase/\">cracking down on password sharing</a> between households. Netflix says that cancel reaction to the password sharing limitation \"continues to be low,\" exceeding its expectations.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/netflix-price-increase-2023/\">Netflix Raising U.S. Prices Yet Again, Premium Plan Now Costs $23/Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-raising-u-s-prices-yet-again-premium-plan-now-costs-23-month.2408016/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88cbec301b3c3370e121e6027df78ba38e6d291b9675818d8e245d21868940cc","category":"Apple"}
