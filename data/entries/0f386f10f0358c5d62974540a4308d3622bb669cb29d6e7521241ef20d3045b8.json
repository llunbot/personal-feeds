He says the moto industry figured it out long ago that the way to make an inverted fork stiff enough is the relationship between the crown and the legs, and tapering the legs appropriately.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype push industries inverted suspension fork for trail and enduro mountain bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-5.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another critical part is keeping the stanchions sliding in tandem, and oversized dropouts with a pinch bolt design. Thick dropouts mean longer axles, which means more overlap on either end, which will also improve stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re guessing it’s sticking with the common 15×110 Boost dimensions, but would also guess it’ll be a floating axle design to keep everything perfectly aligned.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype push industries inverted suspension fork for trail and enduro mountain bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-6.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The dropouts bolt to the stanchions, too, which could allow for a modular design.

Both have surrounds that look to thread out, making it easy to remove any damping cartridge, likely without having to disassemble the entire fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype push industries inverted suspension fork for trail and enduro mountain bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-8.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another interesting little bit is this bolt on the backside. We’re thinking it’s one of three things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It holds a lower bushing/seal/cup in place that captures the lowers in the uppers, which could also act as a top-out bumper.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s a lube/grease port</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It holds a “key” in place and the stanchions have a (or likely multiple) flat face or slot inside the upper that prevents the lowers from spinning around when the wheel and axle are removed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a hex bolt, so it’s probably not a pressure release valve. Any other guesses?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype push industries inverted suspension fork for trail and enduro mountain bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-3.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype push industries inverted suspension fork for trail and enduro mountain bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/push-9-inverted-mountain-bike-suspension-fork-2.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The brush guards shown here are 3D-printed to dial in the fit, but production versions will be injection-molded plastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No word on travel or price, but it should be available this summer.
