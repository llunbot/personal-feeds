{"title":"Halide App Gains Added iPhone 16 Camera Control Functionality","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/halide-camera-control-new-features/","date":1727800780000,"content":"Popular camera app Halide was today updated with new features for the Camera Control button available on the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models. Halide already supported opening the app with Camera Control, but now users can also make adjustments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/halide-camera-app.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nUsing the Camera Control's touch and swipe-based gesture support, Halide users can adjust focus and exposure, and lock their settings in place. The dedicated \"Locked\" adjustment makes sure that no settings can be disturbed from accidental swipes on the Camera Control button, and it is designed for people who do not want to use manual adjustments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Exposure setting allows users to set an exposure bias that exceeds what's possible with Apple's Camera app (-/+ 6 EV vs. 2), and Focus allows for manual focusing on a subject or scene using the Camera Control button. Halide says that Focus provides a smooth manual focus experience with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to these changes, Halide has added a quicker way to capture a photo. Halide takes the photo when the Camera Control button is pressed, while the Camera app from Apple takes the image when the button is released. The difference is minor, but fractions of a second can sometimes make a difference.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHalide says that the quick snap feature works well with the 48-megapixel ProRAW Zero Shutter Lag feature in the app, as well as with Process Zero, an option that Halide added to take 12-megapixel images with no AI and minimal processing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHalide can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. The app is priced at $2.99 per month, $19.99 per year, or $59.99 for a one-time purchase.
