Regardless, both sizes have a 11.39mm thick chassis, which is 0.1mm thinner than Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, and include a flat back, thin bezels, and a height and tilt adjustable stand. Expect Samsung's refreshed monitor to arrive in sometime later in the year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">CES 2024</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/samsung-smart-monitor-4k-refresh/\">CES 2024: Samsung Unveils Refreshed iMac-Style 32-Inch 4K Smart Monitor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-samsung-unveils-refreshed-imac-style-32-inch-4k-smart-monitor.2415750/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c3fbb7996a76f8210dfd45618cd065b58c3a3d1cad81400e6d1eb83a54de7b4b","category":"Apple"}
