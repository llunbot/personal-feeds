After the allegations emerged, Mark Robinson played on what we call \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/due-to-ai-fakes-the-deep-doubt-era-is-here/\">deep doubt\"</a> and denied the comments were his words, claiming they were manufactured by AI.</p>\n\n<p>\"Look, I'm not going to get into the minutia about how somebody manufactured these salacious tabloid lies, but I can tell you this: There's been over one million dollars spent on me through AI by a billionaire's son who's bound and determined to destroy me,\" Robinson told CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski in a televised interview, referring to an <a href=\"https://www.wral.com/story/fully-ai-generated-political-tv-ad-takes-aim-at-north-carolina-governor-s-race/21629401/\">AI-generated political commercial</a> set to air next week. \"The things that people can do with the Internet now is incredible. But what I can tell you is this: Again, these are not my words. This is simply tabloid trash being used as a distraction from the substantive issues that the people of this state are facing.\"</p>\n<p>The CNN investigation found that Robinson, currently serving as North Carolina's lieutenant governor, used the username \"minisoldr\" on a website called \"Nude Africa\" between 2008 and 2012. CNN identified Robinson as the user by matching biographical details, a shared email address, and profile photos. The comments reportedly included Robinson referring to himself as a \"black NAZI!\" and expressing support for reinstating slavery, among other controversial comments.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051248#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051248&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab52b12b6a28edfea3c7c3a1495b000b3dc995407e2b4ada3b66863cb240649e","category":"Tech"}
