OAN is <a href=\"https://www.oann.com/wheretowatch/\">carried by</a> providers including DirecTV, AT&amp;T U-verse, Verizon FiOS, and CenturyLink, but not by large cable operators such as Comcast, Charter, and Cox.</p>\n<p>OAN owner Herring Networks claimed in a <a href=\"courtlistener.com/docket/5929058/herring-networks-inc-v-at-and-t-services-inc/\">2016 lawsuit</a> that AT&amp;T promised to carry OAN on DirecTV in exchange for OAN's public support of AT&amp;T's attempt to purchase the satellite provider, which required government approval. OAN's lawsuit claimed that AT&amp;T reneged on the deal once its purchase of DirecTV was finalized in 2015. OAN finally got on DirecTV in 2017, weeks after agreeing to drop its lawsuit against AT&amp;T. Herring also claimed in court that AT&amp;T in 2013 proposed acquiring a 5 percent ownership stake in Herring, but that purchase was never made.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801788#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801788&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"96dd0c5c630ed728ead7968936569ca55a262aec062b48a448db430387ebae33","category":"Tech"}
