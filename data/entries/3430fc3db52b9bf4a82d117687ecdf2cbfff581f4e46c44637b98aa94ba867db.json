Introducing the new titanium iPhone 15 Pro. Featuring a whole new level of gaming performance with the A17 Pro chip. A more versatile, more advanced Pro camera system. And an aerospace-grade titanium design. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are our lightest, most powerful Pro models ever.</blockquote>For the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ Max, Apple is using a new titanium frame rather than a stainless steel frame, which cuts down on weight. The ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ and ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and ‌‌iPhone 14 Pro‌‌ Max, yet the chassis is more durable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe use of titanium on the ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ also brings with it a change to the chassis finish. Previously, all Pro iPhones used heavily polished stainless steel with a mirror finish as the chassis material. The ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ has a brushed finish that is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones, and is also less prone to fingerprints.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌‌iPhone 15‌‌ Plus continue to feature a chassis made from aluminum. Pre-orders for all ‌iPhone 15‌ models begin on Friday, September 15, with in-store availability beginning a week later on September 22.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ads/\">Ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-showcases-iphone-15-pros-titanium-ad/\">Apple Showcases iPhone 15 Pro's Titanium Chassis in New Ad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-showcases-iphone-15-pros-titanium-chassis-in-new-ad.2401845/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3430fc3db52b9bf4a82d117687ecdf2cbfff581f4e46c44637b98aa94ba867db","category":"Apple"}
