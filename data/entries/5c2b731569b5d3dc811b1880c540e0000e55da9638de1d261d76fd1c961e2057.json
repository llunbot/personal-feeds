The maximum RAM option could rise to 32GB.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLonger battery life is also likely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing in the footsteps of the MacBook Pro, the next MacBook Air models will likely have an upgraded 12-megapixel camera with support for Center Stage, a feature that automatically keeps you centered on video as you move around. The camera should also support Desk View, which shows both you and an overhead view of your desk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCenter Stage is available in video calling apps like FaceTime and Zoom. The feature was previously limited to newer iPad models and Macs connected to Apple's external Studio Display. The new MacBook Pro and iMac models were the first Macs to support Center Stage without needing to rely on a Studio Display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Air models will likely be equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, whereas the current models have two Thunderbolt 3 ports. And the new models will likely support up to two external displays, even when the lid is open. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest MacBook Pro and iMac models can be configured with a nano-texture display, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. It is possible that Apple will extend this option to the new MacBook Air models, but it could opt to keep the option exclusive to the MacBook Pro for differentiation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major external design changes have been rumored for the next MacBook Air models. Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs always, there could be a surprise or two beyond these expected upgrades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the new MacBook Air models do arrive this week, expect a press release on the Apple Newsroom website, and perhaps a YouTube video announcement.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/02/m4-macbook-air-imminent/\">New MacBook Air Announcement Reportedly 'Imminent' — Here's When</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-air-announcement-reportedly-imminent-— heres-when.2451121/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5c2b731569b5d3dc811b1880c540e0000e55da9638de1d261d76fd1c961e2057","category":"Apple"}
