Now, a newly published patent filed by Nintendo seems to confirm that feature and describes how it will work.</p>\n<p>The international patent was filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization in January 2023, but it was <a href=\"https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803\">only published on WIPO's website on Thursday</a>. The Japanese-language patent—whose illustrations match what we've seen of Switch 2 Joy-Con precisely—features an English abstract describing \"a sensor for mouse operation\" that can \"detect reflected light from a detected surface, the light changing by moving over the detected surface...\" much like any number of optical computer mice. Schematic drawings in the patent show how the light source and light sensor are squeezed inside the Joy-Con, with a built-in lens for directing the light to and from each.</p>\n<img width=\"2478\" height=\"3507\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1.png 2478w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1-640x906.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1-1024x1449.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1-768x1087.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1-1085x1536.png 1085w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1-1447x2048.png 1447w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1-980x1387.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mousecon1-1440x2038.png 1440w\" />\n      A schematic diagram of the Switch 2's Joy-Con light sensor\n        Credit:\n          <a href=\"https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo / WIPO</a>\n      \n<p>A machine translation of the full text of the patent describes the controller as \"a novel input device that can be used as a mouse and other than a mouse.\" In mouse mode, as described in the patent, the user cradles the outer edge of the controller with their palm and places the inner edge \"on, for example, a desk or the like.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/nintendo-patent-explains-switch-2-joy-cons-mouse-operation-mode/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/nintendo-patent-explains-switch-2-joy-cons-mouse-operation-mode/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"29e83d675a63c6f2e5581fcb2c6fb1af4773b5853f5107fe6cb0349af978e9f3","category":"Tech"}
