As an employee of DOGE, Schutt accessed FEMA’s proprietary software for managing both disaster and non-disaster funding grants. Under his role at CISA, he likely is privy to sensitive information regarding the security of civilian federal government networks and critical infrastructure throughout the US.</p>\n<h2>A steady stream of published credentials</h2>\n<p>According to journalist <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/doge-bro-kyle-schutts-computer-infected-by-malware-credentials-found-in-stealer-logs/\">Micah Lee</a>, user names and passwords for logging in to various accounts belonging to Schutt have been published at least four times since 2023 in logs from stealer malware. Stealer malware typically infects devices through trojanized apps, phishing, or software exploits. Besides pilfering login credentials, stealers can also log all keystrokes and capture or record screen output. The data is then sent to the attacker and, occasionally after that, can make its way into public credential dumps.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/doge-software-engineers-computer-infected-by-info-stealing-malware/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/doge-software-engineers-computer-infected-by-info-stealing-malware/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5f1f984b655cda3b319607ac4a9462e4116f2f784d75c881b5afb6447691325","category":"Tech"}
