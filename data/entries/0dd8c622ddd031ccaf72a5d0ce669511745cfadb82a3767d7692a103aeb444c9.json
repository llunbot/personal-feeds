No, not that kind of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oGttAmCrPBQ?si=tfxbrHAdEiN82tLK&amp;t=111\" target=\"_blank\">clicker</a>, but a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/schwalbe-clik-valve/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe Clik Valve</a> user? You may have noticed there were no trail pumps that ensure compatibility with the Clik Valve system, until now. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/wolf-tooth-components/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth</a> just announced the first Click Valve compatible pump. The brand’s EnCase line now comes with 30, 40, and 85cc options. Most of the components of the EnCase Pump are the same as the existing <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-radavist-product-awards/#:~:text=Tool/Accessory%20of%20the%20Year%3A\" target=\"_blank\">award-winning pumps</a> that the brand first announced last year, with new parts that interface with the valve. Customers who already have our EnCase Pump can <a href=\"https://alnk.to/7MbAIwB\" target=\"_blank\">purchase a kit</a> to convert the pump from Presta to Clik. The swap takes less than 30 seconds and can easily be swapped back to Presta.</p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://alnk.to/7X6lHlt\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wolf-tooth-encase-pumps-for-schwalbe-clik-valve/\">Wolf Tooth EnCase Pumps for Schwalbe Clik Valve</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"0dd8c622ddd031ccaf72a5d0ce669511745cfadb82a3767d7692a103aeb444c9","category":"Cycling"}
