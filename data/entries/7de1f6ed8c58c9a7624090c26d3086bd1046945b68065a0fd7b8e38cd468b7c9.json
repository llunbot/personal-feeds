Originally opened in 2014 by <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/duncan-from-transit-cycles-black-cat-all-road/\" target=\"_blank\">Duncan</a> and sold to Jenna a few years back. The shop has moved a few times, never very far, to its current spot at the Mercado San Augustine Annex. Since Jenna purchased the shop it has become the only woman-owned and operated bike shop in all of Arizona.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SimWorks-PopUp-Transit-Cycles-21.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SimWorks-PopUp-Transit-Cycles-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SimWorks-PopUp-Transit-Cycles-21.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SimWorks-PopUp-Transit-Cycles-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SimWorks-PopUp-Transit-Cycles-21.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Transit currently stocks all QBP brands, Esker Cycles, State, Omnium Cargo Bikes, and Revel Bikes.
