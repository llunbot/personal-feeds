But spec sheets and Nvidia's own performance estimates showed that there was a deceptively huge performance gap between the two 4080 cards, enough that calling them both \"4080\" could have lead to confusion and upset among buyers.</p>\n<p>Taking the hint, Nvidia reversed course, \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/nvidia-will-unlaunch-the-12gb-rtx-4080-says-its-not-named-right/\">unlaunching</a>\" the 4080 12GB because it was \"not named right.\" This decision came late enough in the launch process that a whole bunch of existing packaging had to be trashed and that new BIOSes with new GPU named needed to be flashed to the cards before they could be sold.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997688#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997688&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"374ad79123bd9ebaaf1ab137af1c8e83602ac47006a08a69cfd47cdaea1351f5","category":"Tech"}
