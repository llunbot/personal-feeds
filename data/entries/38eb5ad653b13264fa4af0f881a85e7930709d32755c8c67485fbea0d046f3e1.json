href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/lauf-true-grit-race-edition-review/\">True Grit gravel bike</a>, where he observed that steeper head angles and shorter trails generally produced more nervous handling, which “held riders back”.</p>\n<p>Applied in a road bike context, Skúlason and his design team suggest that the relatively sharp handling common across many race road bikes might make them feel faster, but doesn’t necessarily translate into real-world speed.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Úthald’s slack front end is said to enable you to ride faster by handling more confidently and predictably, and, in turn, apply power more effectively.</p>\n<p>However, unlike a typical endurance road bike, which features a relatively tall stack compared to a race-oriented bike, the Úthald is claimed to retain a “faster-fit”.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

handling.</p>\n<p>The seat angle is more traditional, at 72.5 degrees in a size Large, with the aim of pitching the rider further forward over the bottom bracket. In theory, this opens the hip angle for improved power transfer compared to a slacker angle.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, although the overall handling is said to be relatively easy-going compared to other race bikes, Lauf has opted to use compact 405mm chainstays. This is the minimum length officially supported by SRAM, the sole supplier of drivetrains for the Úthald.</p>\n<p>In theory, this should elicit sharp responses from the rear of the bike when putting the power down.</p>\n<h2>Seigla-inspired compliance</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" title=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The curved seat tube has a role to play in the compliance, as well as creating more space for the wheel (thanks to the compact 405mm chainstays).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Lauf claims most brands designing race and endurance bikes either don’t offer enough comfort for their riders’ needs, or unnecessarily (and expensively) over-complicate their approach to adding compliance.</p>\n<p>The Icelandic brand says it has taken cues from its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/lauf-seigla-review/\">Seigla gravel bike</a>, which pioneered this ICE (Integrated Compliance Engineering) approach to frame compliance, managing to engineer “around 15mm” of vertical flex into the Úthald’s Impact Resistant Modulus (IRM) carbon frame and components.</p>\n<p>Four elements are said to combine to make this a reality: the slim junction of top tube and seat tube, the slim seatstay profile, the dropped seatstay and seat tube junction, and the offset seat tube design – plus the exposed portion of the seatpost.</p>\n<p>This 15mm figure assumes a 75kg rider aboard, impacting a pothole, while already producing approximately 4.5mm of sag towards the rear hub.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" title=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Úthald means ‘endurance’ in Icelandic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Lauf says this level of compliance is similar to the amount seen from the pivot-based system used by a competitor it didn’t want to name (perhaps Cannondale and its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/cannondale-topstone-carbon-rival-axs-review/\">Topstone Carbon</a>).</p>\n<p>This is in addition to the compliance afforded by the tyres – Lauf specs 700x32c tyres as standard on the Úthald, with the frame capable of accepting up to 700x35c rubber. Lauf says this “is in the ballpark” of what a 20-23mm wide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyre</a> can offer on its own.</p>\n<p>Set against four “carbon road race bikes” from “major brands”, Lauf says the Úthald delivers at least 80 per cent more compliance through the saddle, and at least 25 per cent more compliance through the front end.</p>\n<h2>Aero… but no integrated cockpit</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" title=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Old-fashioned, or simply practical?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While most new road racing bikes are becoming ever more integrated at the front end, Lauf has opted for an old-fashioned, externally routed two-piece arrangement.</p>\n<p>The brand uses its Smoothie road bar (attached to a standard stem), which incorporates glass-fibre sections on the tops, from the stem clamping zone to the ramps.</p>\n<p>This is claimed to help improve compliance through the handlebar, while Skúlason says exposed brake hoses (which route internally from fork and down tube ports) in this area don’t cause any noticeable aero downside.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" title=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lauf specs its own Road Smoothie glass-fibre infused handlebar to improve front-end compliance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Lauf says it considered the use of full internal routing for the Úthald, exploring whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

It’s also claimed to fortify the bottom bracket area for improved pedalling stiffness (the frame features a threaded BSA <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket standard</a>).</p>\n<p>Lauf says the rear elements of the bike are less important for aerodynamics, but the slim seatstays – as well as contributing to the frame’s compliance – are dropped as far as UCI regulations allow for further aero gain (again, Lauf hasn’t quantified the gain this offers, but dropped seatstays are near-ubiquitous on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bikes</a> for this reason).</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting none of the above claims about the Úthald’s aerodynamic efficiency come with any data (such as that derived from wind tunnel or real-world testing) to back them up, though.</p>\n<h2>Lauf Úthald availability, pricing and specifications</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" title=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is the SRAM Force AXS-equipped ‘Race Wireless’ build.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Lauf Úthald is available globally for pre-order now, with first deliveries set to arrive in January 2024, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>There are two builds at launch: the entry-level ‘Weekend Warrior Wireless’ with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM Rival eTap AXS groupset</a> and DT Swiss E1800 Spline alloy wheelset ($3,490, including a single-sided, left-only power meter), and mid-level ‘Race Wireless’ bike with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/sram-force-axs-2023-review/\">SRAM Force AXS groupset</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/zipp-303s-review/\">Zipp 303S carbon wheels</a> ($4,690, including a spider-based power meter).</p>\n<p>The range will be topped by an ‘Ultimate’ model in summer 2024, which Lauf says will be available for around $7,500.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" title=\"Lauf Úthald road bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> ‘Race Wireless’ comes with a Zipp 303S carbon wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Úthald is available in four colours: Obsidian Black (as standard), Rubus Red ($190 extra), and Borealis and Thingvellir Skye (both $390 extra).</p>\n<p>Delivery costs $99 worldwide, exclusive of any tax and/or VAT.</p>\n<h3>Lauf Úthald Race Wireless</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $4,690 (local currency subject to exchange rate)</li>\n<li><strong>Frame:</strong> Lauf Úthald, IRM carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Lauf Úthald, IRM carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Force AXS</li>\n<li><strong>Power meter:</strong> Yes, spider-based</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Zipp 303S, carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Handlebar:</strong> Lauf Road Smoothie, glass fibre/carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> FSA Omega Pro, alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Seatpost:</strong> FSA SL:K, carbon, 27.2mm</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis High-Road, 700x32c, tubeless-ready</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lauf Úthald Race Wireless</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $3,490 (local currency subject to exchange rate)</li>\n<li><strong>Frame:</strong> Lauf Úthald, IRM carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Lauf Úthald, IRM carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Rival eTap AXS</li>\n<li><strong>Power meter:</strong> Yes, single-sided</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> DT Swiss E1800 Spline, alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Handlebar:</strong> Lauf Road Smoothie, glass fibre/carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> FSA Omega Pro, alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Seatpost:</strong> FSA SL:K, carbon, 27.2mm</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Maxxis High-Road, 700x32c, tubeless-ready</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","author":"Ashley Quinlan","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"38eb5ad653b13264fa4af0f881a85e7930709d32755c8c67485fbea0d046f3e1","category":"Cycling"}
