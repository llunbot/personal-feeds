While some existing bags required minimal modifications, hip packs presented a unique challenge that demanded reimagining. The Snagla design draws inspiration from a convertible hip pack bar bag that Wizard Works originally created for Pannier.cc way back in 2021, this existing design served as an ideal foundation for implementing a floating, therefore seam-tapeable, liner.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-7.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-7.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“It’s very hard to compete in price with bags produced overseas, given that we make in London and pay our staff the London Living Wage or above, but we’re committed to back our price tag up with an exceptionally high-quality product – it was that sentiment that really fuelled our waterproofing journey.” Veronica Lowe</p>\n<p>Snagla features a plush padded back panel made with UK made 9mm spacer mesh for all day comfort, with the main buckle located on the wide padded wing to prevent discomfort during rides. The bag is compatible with up to two Quick Draw Bottle Pockets (sold separately and only compatible in hip pack mode), while tensioning straps pull the bag snug against the body for stability on challenging terrain.<br />\nThe roll-top closure offers expandable storage, and a quick-attaching Fidlock Hook Buckle ensures secure, one-handed operation. Snagla includes a floating, seam-taped liner that provides waterproof protection, and two interior mesh drop pocket helps organize smaller items. With the 3.5L capacity Snagla provides ample storage for all day adventuring.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-11.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-11.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Wizard_Works_Snagla-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Recognizing that not all customers require bar bag functionality, Wizard Works offers the bar bag conversion kit as an optional add-on, allowing customers to purchase only the features they need.
