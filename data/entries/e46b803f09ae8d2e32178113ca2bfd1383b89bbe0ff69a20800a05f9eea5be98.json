The company also revealed Claude Code, a command line AI agent for developers currently available as a limited research preview.</p>\n<p>Anthropic calls Claude 3.7 the first \"hybrid reasoning model\" on the market, giving users the option to choose between quick responses or extended, visible chain-of-thought processing similar to OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/\">o1</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">o3</a> series models, Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/\">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking</a>, and DeepSeek's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/\">R1</a>. When using Claude 3.7's API, developers can specify exactly how many tokens the model should use for thinking, up to its 128,000 token output limit.</p>\n<p>The new model is available across all Claude subscription plans, and the extended thinking mode feature is available on all plans except the free tier. API pricing remains unchanged at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with thinking tokens included in the output pricing since they are part of the context considered by the model.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e46b803f09ae8d2e32178113ca2bfd1383b89bbe0ff69a20800a05f9eea5be98","category":"Tech"}
