Being able to hold a strong position allows you to be more aerodynamic, to transfer power more efficiently and protect from aches and pains. And that comes from having solid foundations in the form of your core, the abdominal and back muscles that support the spine and connect your upper and lower body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Core training helps strengthen and stabilise the muscle groups that support your legs so you can ride more comfortably for longer,’ says coach Ric Stern (cyclecoach.com). ‘Strength exercises have been shown to increase cycling performance, particularly FTP and sprint power, and core training increases the strength and mineral density of your bones, which protects against osteoporosis, an issue that affects cyclists, especially if you’ve been trying to hit or stay at a target weight.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-foods-for-cycling\">10 essential foods for cyclists</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-breathe-cycling\">How to breathe better when cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cold-hard-truth-how-to-train-in-winter\">How to train in winter: Intensity, fuelling and more</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>A strong core will also improve your functional fitness, making you more useful off the bike. There’s no point riding a bike for three hours if you can’t move afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stern has chosen four exercises to combine into a circuit, with each working the core in different ways. But don’t try to do too much too soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you haven’t ever squatted before, or for a long time, start with your bodyweight, then progress to a kettlebell or dumb-bells,’ he says. Note that between them these moves will also work your upper and lower back, shoulders, legs and glutes. A strong core isn’t much use on its own if the other links in the chain are weak.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Planks and tall planks</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-01-970x573.jpg\" alt=\"Core exercises\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-01-970x573.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-01-300x177.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-01-768x454.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-01-750x443.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-01-1140x674.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-01.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Mansfield</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Target: </strong>Core</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sets: </strong>1<strong> Reps:</strong> 3× 30sec</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do a plank, start by lying down on your front. Raise onto your forearms, with your elbows directly under your shoulders, and hold your body in a straight line from head to heels. Hold for 30 seconds, rest and then repeat for three reps, aiming to build to 3× 60sec. Focus on engaging the core by pulling your belly button up and keeping your torso flat and in line.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-02-970x536.jpg\" alt=\"Core exercises\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-02-970x536.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-02-300x166.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-02-768x424.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-02-750x414.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-02-1140x630.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Mansfield</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To progress, start in the plank position, then push up one arm at a time so you’re in a press-up position. Return to the plank position, minimising movements in your core, and repeat for 30sec. Start with 3× 30sec and progress to 3× 60sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why do it?</strong> ‘Planks really build a strong core, which helps you keep a good posture while cycling and helps prevent or reduce back ache, especially on a long ride,’ says Stern. ‘They can also help you avoid getting a rounded back, which you can get from too much time spent in an aero position on the bike.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Box Superman</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-03-970x520.jpg\" alt=\"Core exercises\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-03-970x520.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-03-300x161.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-03-768x412.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-03-750x402.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-03-1140x611.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Mansfield</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Target:</strong> Core, plus shoulders, hamstrings and glutes</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3 <strong>Reps:</strong> 8</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rest on your knees and hands. Keeping your back flat, engage your core by pulling your belly button upwards, then extend your left arm forwards and at the same time extend your right leg backwards so both limbs are straight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring your elbow and knee in to meet beneath your abdominals. Return to the starting position and hold briefly before repeating for 8 reps. Repeat on the other side. Aim to start with 3× 8 reps on each side, and build to 4× 12 reps.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-04-970x569.jpg\" alt=\"Core exercises\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-04-970x569.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-04-300x176.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-04-768x451.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-04-750x440.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-04-1140x669.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Mansfield</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Why do it?</strong> ‘It helps to build a strong core, and strengthens your upper back and shoulders, which helps with positioning on the bike,’ says Stern. ‘It also strengthens the posterior chain – the muscles from your upper back to your calves – which can be weak in cyclists. A strong posterior chain increases power on the bike and helps activate muscles such as the glutes correctly.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Crunch to extension</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-05-970x650.jpg\" alt=\"Core exercises\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-05-970x650.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-05-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-05-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-05-750x503.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-05-1140x764.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/training-core-exercises-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Mansfield</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Target:</strong> Abdominals, lower back, upper back</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sets:</strong> 3 <strong>Reps:</strong> 8</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lie on the floor on your back.

As well as building core strength for stability, squats produce more power for cycling by strengthening your legs and glutes for short sprints or longer, more sustained efforts.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-core-exercises\">Four core exercises to make you a better cyclist</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5fb3ec93b21cc08664634029e30f479386cd8d43e2f3c7fc5f5663943e3d8261","category":"Cycling"}
