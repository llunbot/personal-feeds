And at this price it’s hard to pass up: <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1770934-REG/apple_mqkp3ll_a_15_macbook_air_space.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249&amp;SID=1-1-2263825-1-0-0\">B&amp;H Photo is selling the 15-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage for $999</a>, a savings of $300 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the new 2024 model, the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air has a slower chip, slower Wi-FI speeds, and support for just a single external monitor. Otherwise, it’s one of the best laptops we’ve ever used, with a stunning  15.3-inch Liquid Retina display that’s perfect for multitasking or movie-watching. You also get the MacBook Air hallmarks: all-day battery life, whisper-quiet operation, and an incredibly thin and light design, along with fast charging with MagSafe, and a pair of Thunderbolt ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we praised the Air’s design and stellar performance and our opinion hasn’t changed despite the launch of the M3. So grab one now and get ready for the age of spatial computing.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ecade18cb09f04023d282a1b5a309aadc039709635e7915daac39fb6f1a50e64","category":"Apple"}
