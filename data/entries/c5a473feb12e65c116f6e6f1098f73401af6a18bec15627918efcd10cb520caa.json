There are 240, 120, 60, 48, 30, and 24 frames per second options to choose from.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's always been a feature for adjusting the speed of select parts of Slo-mo videos, but Playback Speed is a separate control. You can get to it by opening up the editing interface for a video, and then tapping on the timer icon at the top right.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models support 4K 120fps video in Slo-mo and Video modes, and the Playback Speed feature can be used for making adjustments after you shoot a video. From Apple's keynote event:<blockquote>You can use 4k 120, in Slo-mo or Video mode, and now you don't have to make that upfront decision on frame rate. You can adjust the playback speed after capture. In the new Photos app, there's a quarter speed playback, a new half speed option that really adds a wonderful, dreamy effect, or you can bring it back to normal speed. There's also a 1/5 speed option that corresponds to 24 frames per second playback. These playback speeds are great for easy on the go editing.</blockquote>\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ with the Playback Speed feature is set to be released to the public on Monday, September 16.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/11/ios-18-edit-video-playback-speed/\">iOS 18 Lets You Edit Video Speed With the Photos App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-lets-you-edit-video-speed-with-the-photos-app.2435926/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c5a473feb12e65c116f6e6f1098f73401af6a18bec15627918efcd10cb520caa","category":"Apple"}
