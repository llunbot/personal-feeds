It's expanding tools that help PC developers bring premium games to Android, and games are heading in the other direction, too. The PC-based Play Games platform is expanding to bring every single Android game to Windows. Google doesn't have a firm timeline for all these changes, but 2025 will be an interesting year for the company's gaming efforts.</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/google-play-games-beta-now-on-windows-desktops-if-thats-your-thing/\">released the first beta</a> of Google Play Games on PC back in 2022, allowing you to play Android games on a PC. It has chugged along quietly ever since, mostly because of the anemic and largely uninteresting game catalog. While there are hundreds of thousands of Android games, only a handful were made available in the PC client. That's changing in a big way now that Google is bringing over every Android game from Google Play.</p>\n<p>Starting today, you'll see thousands of new games in Google Play Games on PC. Developers actually have to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/games/playgames/development-submit#distribution-opt-in\">opt out</a> if they don't want their games available on Windows machines via Google Play Games. Google says this is possible thanks to improved custom controls, making it easy to map keyboard and gamepad controls onto games that were designed for touchscreens (see below). The usability of these mapped controls will probably vary dramatically from game to game.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/at-gdc-google-promises-more-pc-games-on-android-more-android-games-on-pc/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/at-gdc-google-promises-more-pc-games-on-android-more-android-games-on-pc/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a829391ca044dff778952f70657829e19e6945a4a12a2565e762b568c81ee50","category":"Tech"}
