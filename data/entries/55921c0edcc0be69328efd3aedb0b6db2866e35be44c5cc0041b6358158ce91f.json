Well, look no further. Steve Potts has taken his tried and true Type II fork design and broken it into two categories, a <a href=\"https://www.stevepottsbicycles.com/store/p19/Mountain_Type_II_R_Fork.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mountain fork</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.stevepottsbicycles.com/store/p20/Gravel%2FRoad_Mini_Type_II_R_Fork.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mini Gravel fork</a>. Both of which have cargo bosses on the fork legs, that iconic sleeved unicrown design and thru-axles.  The retail for both forks is $500 a pop, which is not bad at all!</p>\n<p><strong>Mountain fork specs:</strong><br />\nChromoly construction:<br />\nSteer tube 1.125″ x 350 mm long, ( threadless)<br />\nIS disc mount<br />\nEverything pack mounts<br />\nStandard rack mount ( Pass and Stow, etc.)<br />\n12 mm x 100 mm thru – axle<br />\nAxle to crown: 419 mm<br />\nRake: 47 mm<br />\nStock color: Silver crown, black legs:<br />\nWill fit tires up to 75 mm x 736 mm tall, ( 27.5 ” x 3″ 0r 29 ” x 2.25″ )</p>\n<p><strong>Gravel fork specs:</strong><br />\nSame chromoly specs as the Mountain Fork but with:<br />\nAxle to crown: 401 mm<br />\nWill fit tires up to 700c x 50 mm</p>\n<p>See the full lineup at <a href=\"https://www.stevepottsbicycles.com/store/p19/Mountain_Type_II_R_Fork.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Potts Cycles</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"55921c0edcc0be69328efd3aedb0b6db2866e35be44c5cc0041b6358158ce91f","category":"Cycling"}
