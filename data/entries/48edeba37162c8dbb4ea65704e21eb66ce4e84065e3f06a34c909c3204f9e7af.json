My name is Andrew. Some of you might know me from my business (<a href=\"https://www.andrewthemaker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ATM Handmade Goods</a>) or Instagram name (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrewthemaker/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@AndrewtheMaker</a>). I run a little one-person operation making bicycle bags in Kansas City, MO.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC9946.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC9943.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Every year I try to get out into the mountains for a few days of bikepacking and trying out new gear. The past few years I’ve been bikepacking upon a custom Ti hardtail I designed but even with its progressive geometry I was never comfortable switching back and forth with my trail bike here on my home trails. After a lap of the Vapor Trail bikepacking route last year I decided I was going to get a short travel full suspension to replace it. I researched a bunch of different bikes and finally stumbled upon the Banshee Phantom. The global parts shortage was in full swing but luckily Banshee had some frames showing up pretty quickly so I jumped on it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC9933.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I was able to get it built up only needing a new seatpost which my favorite local shop One Star Bicycles had in stock. I didn’t really know what to expect from the bike and I was instantly blown away by how good it was right out of the box! There were a few shortcomings on my build kit that I wanted to address before this summer’s bikepacking trip and luckily my friends over at One Star Bicycles again got me fixed up. Moral of the story is to have a great relationship with your local bike shop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC9938.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC9939.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’m getting ready to head out on the Colorado Trail with some friends. Since I have a business and two small kids it’s hard to do the whole thing, so I’ll be joining them halfway and finishing the route back to Denver. Here is a full spec list on the bike build, some of the parts were picked because of availability but it all works great together.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC9950.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\nFrame: Banshee Phantom XL 2020 in Raw<br />\nFork: Rockshox Pike RCT3 2015 model year<br />\nShock: Fox DPX2<br />\nSeatpost: One Up 200mm with a Wolftooth dropper lever and Spurcycles Bell mount<br />\nHandlebars: Moonmen custom risers with about a 3″ rise and mid teen sweep and Ergon grips<br />\nStem: GT BMX 40mm 7/8″ clamp<br />\nWheels: Enve AM30(thanks One Star Bicycles!) these were one of the hardest things to get<br />\nTires: Specialized Ground Control Grid 2.35 with Cushcore inserts<br />\nDrivetrain: Sram GX Lunar derailleur and shifter.
