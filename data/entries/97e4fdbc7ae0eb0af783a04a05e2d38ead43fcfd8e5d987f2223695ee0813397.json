This trail really gives you a sense of what mountain biking’s all about.</p>\n<p>However, it was one close battle.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pipped at the post, BikePark Wales just misses out on our top spot.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Glentress’s Blue Route isn’t quite all killer, no filler, with the upper 8km loop not being quite as entertaining as the lower one.</p>\n<p>We’ll let it off, though, because you can tackle the bottom on its own if you fancy a shorter ride (just make sure to add in ‘Berm Baby Berm’!), but it only beat the <a href=\"https://www.forestryengland.uk/cannop-cycle-centre/verderers-trail-cannop-cycle-centre\" target=\"_blank\">Forest of Dean’s Verderers Trail</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeparkwales.com/mountain-bike-trails-wales\" target=\"_blank\">BikePark Wales’s Beast of Burden/Sixtapod/Willy Waver</a> by the slimmest of margins.</p>\n<p>We felt the climb at BPW was a touch too demanding to make it a truly fun loop, especially for beginners, and while the trails there are thrilling to thrash down, there’s less variety in terrain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Despite not taking the overall crown, our winner for England, the Forest of Dean’s Verderers Trail, is guaranteed to provide a great time whether you’re new to MTB or a seasoned rider.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As for the Verderers, the refurbished sections are a blast, and the way the trail undulates, rather than heading straight up and then back down, is less intimidating for newbies.</p>\n<p>Still, there aren’t quite the same possibilities to get creative. All three are fantastic places to ride, but we could only pick one winner.</p>\n<p>A big thanks to Saracen Bikes and all those who helped us find Britain’s best blue. Now go and try them for yourself – you won’t be disappointed!</p>\n<h2>Our winner</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Julia and Luke getting ready to take on the blue trails at Glentress trail centre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Blue Route</h3>\n<p><strong>Where:</strong> Glentress Forest, near Peebles, Scottish Borders<br /><strong>Trail length:</strong> 16km (or you can just ride the 8km lower loop)<br /><strong>Get there:</strong> EH45 8NB</p>\n<p><strong>Crawford Walker</strong> – <em>MBUK reader</em></p>\n<p>“The Glentress blue is class.
