It comes in a range of fun colors, such as blue, pink, yellow, gray, and white, and it is compatible with all iPads from 2018 and later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/zagg-pro-stylus-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1201\" />\r<br />\nPriced at $80, the Pro Stylus 2 includes a fine tip for precise drawing and writing at one end, with a round, capacitive tip at the other end. The capacitive tip can be used in place of a finger for interacting with iPadOS, preventing smudges on the display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the ‌Apple Pencil‌, the Pro Stylus 2 supports tilt recognition and palm rejection. It comes with a wireless charging cradle, but it can also be attached magnetically to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> for charging or charged with a Qi-based charger.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPushing on the end of the Pro Stylus 2 turns it on so that it can connect to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and it will go idle after 15 minutes to save battery life. The stylus is meant to last for up to six and a half hours before it needs to be recharged.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Pro Stylus 2 can be <a href=\"https://www.zagg.com/pro-stylus-2\">purchased from the ZAGG website</a> starting today.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/zagg/\">Zagg</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/zagg-pro-stylus-2-for-ipad/\">ZAGG Launches New $80 Pro Stylus 2 for iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/zagg-launches-new-80-pro-stylus-2-for-ipad.2398747/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec86134c81cabed659f22c358e80849e1a5f453b1bf731e31cd1603842c1a556","category":"Apple"}
