Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>GARDEN GROVE, Calif.â€”There's no shortage of companies looking to reinvent the delivery experience using everything from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/amazon-begins-testing-deliveries-with-sidewalk-drones/\">sidewalk drones</a> to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/amazon-adds-its-10000th-rivian-electric-delivery-van-to-its-fleet/\">electric vans</a>. Some are succeeding, but many more have failed by trying to radically rethink the simple, age-old task of getting stuff from one place to another.</p>\n<p>Harbinger likewise wants to shake up part of that industry but in a decidedly understated way.
