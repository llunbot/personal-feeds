Franklin</a>'s 1846 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition\">Arctic expedition</a> to cross the Northwest Passage. According to a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X24003766\">recent paper</a> published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, DNA analysis revealed that a tooth recovered from a mandible at one of the relevant archaeological sites was that of Captain James Fitzjames of the HMS <em>Erebus</em>. His remains show clear signs of cannibalism, confirming early Inuit reports of desperate crew members resorting to eating their dead.</p>\n<p>\"Concrete evidence of James Fitzjames as the first identified victim of cannibalism lifts the veil of anonymity that for 170 years spared the families of individual members of the 1845 Franklin expedition from the horrific reality of what might have befallen the body of their ancestor,\" the authors wrote in their paper. \"But it also shows that neither rank nor status was the governing principle in the final desperate days of the expedition as they strove to save themselves.\"</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/fresh-images-of-hms-terror-shipwreck-could-clear-up-lingering-mysteries/\">previously reported</a>, Franklin's two ships, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Erebus_(1826)\">HMS <em>Erebus</em></a> and the HMS <em>Terror</em>, became icebound in the Victoria Strait, and all 129 crew members ultimately died. It has been an enduring mystery that has captured imaginations ever since. Novelist Dan Simmons immortalized the expedition in his 2007 horror novel, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(novel)\"><em>The Terror</em></a>, which was later adapted into an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(TV_series)\">anthology TV series</a> for AMC in 2018.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053415#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053415&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c8558352c6a2e73cd47552c40c749ea8ae3cc860cfe50870332e5e6c6b485e0","category":"Tech"}
