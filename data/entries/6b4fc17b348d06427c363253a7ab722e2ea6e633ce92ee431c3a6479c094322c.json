Plus, it adds character to what can often be a pretty dull space.</span></p>\n<p><span>We’d also recommend getting your goals or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-plan-your-winter-training/\">winter training plan</a> up on the wall, so you can physically see it, keep on track and remind yourself why you’re bothering at all.</span></p>\n<h2>Get smart</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Indoor cycling setup\" title=\"Indoor cycling setup\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Smart trainers have made the turbo experience more realistic and interactive than ever.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p><span>Long gone are the days when using a turbo trainer felt like riding through treacle in the middle of a hurricane. </span></p>\n<p><span>The latest </span><span>smart trainers </span><span>offer a more realistic ride quality than ever and are quiet enough not to disturb your family, housemates or neighbours.</span></p>\n<p><span>A smart trainer needn’t break the bank, either.

A small desktop fan simply won’t cut it in the heat of a tough session.</span></p>\n<p>A remote-controlled fan is also ideal, as you can adjust the speed of the fan as the intensity of your workout increases.</p>\n<p>And if you want a sure-fire sign of how popular indoor training now is, there are even cycling-specific fans out there, which can link up to your smart trainer to vary the amount of cooling based on how hard you are pedalling.</p>\n<p><span>Otherwise, if you’ve got a window nearby then open it, and remember, you won’t require anywhere near as many layers as you normally would on your bike.
