The \"just about\" part was mainly about the cost because to be happy with it long-term, it was a good idea for just about everybody to spend an extra $200 upgrading it from 8GB to 16GB of RAM. Apple also kept the M2 version of the Air in the lineup to hit its $999 entry-level price point; the M3 cost $100 extra.</p>\n<p>Apple fixed the RAM problem last fall when it increased the minimum amount of RAM across the entire Mac lineup from 8GB to 16GB without increasing prices. Though Apple probably did it to help enable additional Apple Intelligence features down the line, nearly anything you do with your Mac will eventually benefit from extra memory, whether you're trying to use Photoshop or Logic Pro or even if you're just opening more than a couple of dozen browser tabs at once.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-m4-macbook-air-review-i-have-no-notes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-m4-macbook-air-review-i-have-no-notes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0018c9c93d7b43f90092e9433c88960f1964b7353dbaaa73cceb06ca94c91c2b","category":"Tech"}
