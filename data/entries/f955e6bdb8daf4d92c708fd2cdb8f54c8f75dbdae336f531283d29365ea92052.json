It will do so by two different means, drilling to collect material from beneath the ground, as well as using a robotic arm to gather regolith from the surface.</p>\n<p>Then a part of the spacecraft is due to blast off from the surface of the Moon—likely on Monday evening, US time—before making a return flight to China. If successful, this would be the first time samples have been returned to Earth from the far side of the Moon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028564#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028564&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f955e6bdb8daf4d92c708fd2cdb8f54c8f75dbdae336f531283d29365ea92052","category":"Tech"}
