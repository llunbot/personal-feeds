As I finish up this edition I'm listening to the post-Flight Readiness Review news conference for Boeing's Crew Flight Test. It sounds like everything remains on track for a launch attempt on May 6, at 10:34 pm ET. It's exciting to see this important milestone for Boeing and the US human spaceflight program so near to hand.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

SaxaVord Spaceport in Scotland is on track to launch the United Kingdom’s first vertical rocket into orbit, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdg4x3524eo\">the BBC reports</a>. The Civil Aviation Authority has granted a range license to the Scottish spaceport, which will allow the company to control the sea and airspace during launch. Previously, the site received a spaceport license in December 2023. Ambitiously, the facility aims to launch up to 30 rockets every year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019995#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019995&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"810b01095ba52387c1bfaba8f9eb12ab58f49afd8ddd7f575a9c849c79251817","category":"Tech"}
