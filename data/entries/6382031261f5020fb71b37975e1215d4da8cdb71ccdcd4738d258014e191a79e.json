The move comes as the social media platform nears the introduction of its initial public offering (IPO), which could happen as soon as next month.</p>\n\n<p>Reddit initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be worth $60 million a year, earlier in 2024 to potential investors of an anticipated IPO, Bloomberg said. The Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could serve as a model for future agreements with other AI companies.</p>\n<p>After an era where AI companies utilized AI training data <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/\">without</a> expressly seeking any rightsholder permission, some tech firms have more recently begun entering deals where some content used for training AI models similar to GPT-4 (which runs the paid version of ChatGPT) comes under license. In December, for example, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/axel-springer-partnership\">signed an agreement</a> with German publisher Axel Springer (publisher of Politico and Business Insider) for access to its articles. Previously, OpenAI has struck deals with other organizations, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-associated-press-ap-f86f84c5bcc2f3b98074b38521f5f75a\">the Associated Press</a>. Reportedly, OpenAI is also in licensing talks with CNN, Fox, and Time, among others.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004431#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004431&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6382031261f5020fb71b37975e1215d4da8cdb71ccdcd4738d258014e191a79e","category":"Tech"}
