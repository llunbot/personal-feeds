The latest information from Ice Universe, shared yesterday <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5673255066/OoxQuAnxl?pagetype=profilefeed\">on Weibo</a>, corroborates this and claims that the alleged display sizes and price points will be as follows:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n  <li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display ($799)</li>\r<br />\n  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display ($1,099)</li>\r<br />\n  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>: 6.86-inch LTPO display ($1,199)</li>\r<br />\n  <li><strong>iPhone 17 \"Slim\"</strong>: 6.65-inch LTPO display ($1,299)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, all four ‌iPhone 17‌ models will apparently feature LTPO displays for the first time, enabling ProMotion for a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. To date, ProMotion displays have been exclusive to Apple's \"Pro\" devices, so the ‌iPhone 17‌ may be the first time that the technology expands to a lower-cost device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Slim\" is said to become the new ‌iPhone‌ flagship with a price tag of approximately $1,299, making it the most expensive ‌iPhone‌ model to date. It will allegedly feature a 6.65-inch display, placing it between the ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro Max in size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro models will purportedly feature 12GB of memory, a triple 48-megapixel rear camera system, and an A19 Pro chip fabricated with TSMC's N3P process, whereas the standard model will feature a separate A19 chip. This contrasts with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup, which is expected to feature the same A18 chip across the board.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe post also suggests that the ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Slim\" will feature an A19 chip, a dual dear camera system, an aluminum chassis, and 8GB of memory, but it is not clear if this is accurate. It is possible that this information has simply been assumed based on its replacement of the \"Plus\" model and it seems potentially strange for the new high-end model to have inferior specifications to the Pro models. The ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup is expected to be introduced in September 2025.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/\">Ice Universe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/\">iPhone 17 Lineup Specs Detail Display Upgrade and New High-End Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-display-upgrade-and-new-high-end-model.2431922/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b95982ccf9a8b5838763da585817236766b27372b51f34f6adbd596e43e4ab7d","category":"Apple"}
