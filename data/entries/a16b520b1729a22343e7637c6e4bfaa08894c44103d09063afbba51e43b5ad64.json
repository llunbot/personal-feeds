After a humble beginning, Grand Départs (to use the French term as a catch-all) have become a novelty for Grand Tour organisers. They can sell them off to the highest bidder as countries, provinces and regions across the continent (and beyond) bid millions of Euros for the right to host the opening stages of a three-week race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the 1950s, the opening stages to all three Grand Tours was confined to each race’s home nation, Italy, France or Spain. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-1954-amsterdam\">Once the Tour started abroad for the first time in 1954</a>, however, the floodgates opened for foreign lands to welcome the race – even if it seemed at odds with the Tour de France’s distinctly French identity. There have been 26 foreign starts to the Tour de France to date, compared to 15 editions of the Giro d’Italia and just five of the Vuelta a España, which was the last of the three to venture abroad for the first time (in 1997).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’ll be revealing our top ten Grand Départs from all three Grand Tours over the years. To make the list, we’re factoring in novelty value, the quality of the racing action and the level of fan appreciation. Both foreign starts and ones at home will be counted, however the very nature of overseas starts means they are far more likely to stick in our memory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>10.

Over the years there have been talks of a New York start or even the far-flung idea of visiting Japan. These continent-spanning plans never ended up happening, but that didn’t stop the Giro from discovering new nations to add to cycling’s rich roadmap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example of this was Hungary, which had to wait an extra two years than originally planned to make its Grand Tour debut due to the pandemic. It was worth the wait, however. On the home straight of Stage 1 to Visegrád, which culminated in a slight drag to the line, Mathieu van der Poel would sprint in the hoods past Grand Tour debutant Biniam Girmay – as Caleb Ewan crashed behind them – to take the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia rosa</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With crowds out on the streets of Budapest, Stage 2 was a short time-trial filled with tourist spots you’re bound to have seen on Instagram at some point in your life. There, it would be Simon Yates who’d take the stage, giving a brief glimmer of hope into a GC campaign that would eventually crumble once the race hit the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the final stage on Hungarian soil, it would see Mark Cavendish take his first Giro victory in nine years, perhaps helped by the healing properties of nearby Lake Balaton, a popular holiday destination for countries caught behind the Iron Curtain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, Hungary was a solid host for the Giro d’Italia, providing three stages packed with a real mix of terrain and action. We ticked off some well-known sights while also getting the chance to see two legends of the sport in Van der Poel and Cavendish lay claim to memorable Giro stage victories. Hopefully, this paves the way for more Central European countries to get involved. Surely Peter Sagan can help push a Grande Partenza in Slovakia.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.

Knowing how seldom the Giro visits the island, it was a particular honour for it to be chosen to host the start of the milestone event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opening day, uncharacteristically a road stage, was filled with tension. In the end, the expected sprint was foiled by lone lead-out man Lukas Pöstlberger, whose seated effort saw him gain a gap over the peloton that wouldn’t be closed. With team sprinter Sam Bennett giving him the green light to go for the upset win, the Austrian caught out the sprint trains of the likes of Trek-Segafredo, Orica-Scott and Lotto-Soudal, allowing for an historic stage victory for the Grand Tour rookie. With that, the newly promoted Bora-Hansgrohe team, on their Giro debut no less, led every classification by the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a fairly docile second stage – in terms of action, not scenery – Stage 3 burst into action in the final kilometres. Kings of the crosswinds at the time, QuickStep, ripped the peloton apart in the windy finale to Cagliari. With new pink jersey André Greipel caught out, Fernando Gaviria was given the chance to sniff out the stage honours and the pink jersey, all within the first three days of his Grand Tour career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the route offered three flat stages. In reality, all of them panned out in very different ways. It made for interesting viewing, and the three changes in the pink jersey certainly highlight that. Factor in the novelty of visiting Sardinia, and I think the Giro organisers can be happy with their short trip to the island.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/our-perfect-british-grand-depart\">We mapped out the 2027 British Tour de France Grand Départs</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-grand-depart-gallery\">Gallery: Behind the scenes at the Tour de France 2024 Grand Départ</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-roche\">Tour de France history: Stephen Roche does the Giro/Tour double in 1987</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-1954-amsterdam\">Tour de France history: The first foreign Grand Départ in 1954</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>8.

And that’s not just because this was the first Tour in almost a decade to not include Bernard Hinault, nor because it was the furthest from the French border to have taken place up to that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handed to the city in celebration of Berlin’s 750th birthday, the Tour’s visit would come just two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall. At the time, the German capital was still divided into two, with the communist side to the east and the capitalist half to the west. Before the race, riders were photographed by the graffiti-covered wall, with the race strictly confined to the western side of Berlin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not being allowed to visit East Berlin, the pro race was broadcast across East Germany, the kind of thing that was a rarity during the DDR days, especially since East Germany had a rival Tour de France of its own at the time: the Peace Race. Having left communist Poland to race for an Italian squad, it was fitting that Lech Piasecki would lead the GC for two of the three days held in the city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However the actual racing was a bit of a letdown. Two of the three stages were time-trials, which were mainly due to the lack of space to work with in West Berlin. They squeezed a lot into the three days as a whole, however, visiting Kurfürstendamm in the prologue and Tiergarten in Stage 3. Overall though, it stands as a bit of a time capsule for this era in Europe and it’s still the only time a Grand Tour has visited Berlin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.

However, in 2014, the Emerald Isle played host to the Giro d’Italia for the first time, making this the most westerly Grande Partenza in the race’s history, and providing one of the longest transfers in race history too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ireland embraced the Giro with open arms, as pink took over the streets of Belfast and the north of Ireland. The opening stage around the Ulster capital showed off its main sights, with a start ramp positioned <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/weird-grand-tour-starts\">outside the new Titanic Museum</a> towards the docks and an intermediate time check at Stormont. For Belfast, this was a golden opportunity to show the city in a new light for an international audience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ambience was altered when Dan Martin crashed out during Stage 1’s team time-trial, just one month after a spill had prevented him from tasting Liège-Bastogne-Liège glory. Regardless, the following days were all about Marcel Kittel. He would bag a win at the end of a rainy day through the Glens of Antrim on Stage 2, then again once the race crossed into the Republic for Stage 3. <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/regionals/herald/giro-fan-who-took-crash-selfie-apologises/30271621.html\" target=\"_blank\">A fan in Dublin got into hot water</a> for taking a selfie with an exhausted Kittel, who had parked himself on the concrete after overcoming a large deficit to pip Team Sky to the win on Stage 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot then thickened when the German pulled out overnight, quitting the Giro before it even reached Italy, which was a fair three-hour flight away. Kittel at least got to experience a lively Grande Partenza, though, one that highlighted several areas of Ireland in a great way – albeit with characteristic non-stop rain throughout the three days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

Not only did it mean the Tour had to finally budge on its reluctance to add an extra rest day to the race itinerary, but it also felt a long time coming, given that the Scandinavian nation has become one of the sport’s most successful nations over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect, Denmark threw themselves into it. Heaps of supporters were out for the team presentation at Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen’s antique theme park, perhaps making this the best-attended team presentation in the Tour’s history. The chants of ‘Vingegaard, Vingegaard’ from the crowd were a real highlight of the ceremony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The racing served up three interesting narratives as well. After skirting past the Little Mermaid faster than anyone else, Yves Lampaert’s post-race interview on Stage 1 was one to remember. The following day, he would be one of the very few victims on the much-awaited Green Belt Bridge, which was originally speculated to be a hotspot for echelons only for it came to a bunch sprint anyway. For the winner, Fabio Jakobsen, the victory would be an emotional one, having recovered from a horrific crash at the Tour de Pologne two years prior. There was another reminder of that crash on the final Danish stage, when Dylan Groenwegen – the other rider involved in that incident – claimed his first Grand Tour stage in three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Denmark’s Tour debut was well-received. It was the first to be covered by Netflix in its <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em> series, and Vingegaard’s eventual win would add a sweet cherry on top of the cake for the organisers.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/our-perfect-british-grand-depart\">We mapped out the 2027 British Tour de France Grand Départs</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-grand-depart-gallery\">Gallery: Behind the scenes at the Tour de France 2024 Grand Départ</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-roche\">Tour de France history: Stephen Roche does the Giro/Tour double in 1987</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-1954-amsterdam\">Tour de France history: The first foreign Grand Départ in 1954</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>5.

Yes, Italy has a Grand Tour of its own, but France had been given hosting rights for the Giro back in 1998, long before the favour was reciprocated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under scorching sunshine, the Renaissance capital of Florence was given centre stage for the team presentation and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-grand-depart-gallery\">opening stage</a>. It was the most picturesque Grand Départ in some time – we got photos in cathedrals, art galleries and a roll-out along the stunning narrow streets of Florence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, Tuscany was a breathtaking backdrop for the first stage, with the finish set up in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marco-pantani-the-birth-of-il-pirata\">Marco Pantani’s hometown of Cesenatico</a>. It was a fitting ode to the Italian, especially since his 1998 Giro-Tour double would be repeated by Tadej Pogačar just three weeks later. The action lived up to this legendary billing, as Romain Bardet slipped away with teammate Frank van den Broek in the closing kilometres, securing a career first yellow jersey at his final time of asking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No stranger to hosting bike races, Bologna’s San Luca provided another iconic canvas for Stage 2. There, we saw a chaotic breakaway take the victory while the GC favourites clashed for the first time on the slopes of a climb often used at the Tre Valle Varesine. Then to top it all off, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-biniam-girmay\">Biniam Girmay took a historic victory</a> in Turin on the final day in Italy, securing this Grand Départ’s place in this ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m hoping recency bias isn’t blinding my opinion here, but the Italian Grand Départ was a real heartwarmer. Who knew the host nation of the Giro could welcome the Tour in such style?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

The region has produced more Tour de France winners than any other in France bar Paris, and with two Breton-based teams on the startlist, home support was thick on the ground once the Tour visited once again in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Breton Grand Départ kicked off with an opening stage from Brest, hometown of Valentin Madouas, to Landerneau, not far from where David Gaudu grew up. After the infamous ‘Opi-Omi crash’, we expected a battle between Grand Tour debutant Mathieu van der Poel – who was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\">wearing a kit designed in homage to his grandfather Raymond Poulidor</a> – and Wout van Aert. This was almost derailed by another mass pile-up within the final 5km, but was ultimately defused by Julian Alaphilippe, whose attack early on the Côte de la Fosse aux Loups saw him take the stage victory in the rainbow jersey, adding a third stint in yellow to his burgeoning collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 2 was the main affair of the weekend, however. With a stroke of genius, Van der Poel jumped away for bonus seconds on the first lap of the Mûr de Bretagne before leaving something in the tank for his final move up the climb on the last lap to take not only his first – and to date only – Tour de France stage win but also the yellow jersey, something his legendary grandfather never managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crash-filled final day in Brittany the day after allowed for one final surprise, with Tim Merlier taking a stage on Tour debut, rounding out a successful three days in the Celtic province for his Alpecin-Fenix squad. The same can’t be said for Primož Roglič, who suffered a heavy crash in the final kilometres, ruling out any chance of redemption for his meltdown on La Planche des Belles Filles the year prior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s just a shame the race quickly fizzled out by the end of week one, when Tadej Pogačar put the GC contest to bed on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">Stage 8 to Le Grand Bornand</a>, stretching his lead in the overall standings to almost five minutes after just one week of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

In what would be a 100% French Tour, Corsica was granted the right to host the three opening days, ending its 100-year absence from the Tour route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this uncharted territory, the Tour began – as it often does – with a crash-littered opening stage. To add to the chaos, the Orica-GreenEdge bus got wedged underneath the finishing gantry. As the bus was freed, we slowly saw each of the big sprinters suffer a killer blow in the final couple of kilometres, with Cavendish, Greipel and Sagan all plagued by poor luck on the approach to Bastia. In their absence, we witnessed the beginning of Marcel Kittel’s tyranny in the Tour de France sprints as the imposing German claimed the first of his 14 stage wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the following stage, a lumpy affair from Bastia to Ajaccio, Jan Bakelants would hold on from the breakaway to claim a shock victory, only for commentator Phil Liggett to misidentify him as Maikel Irizar as he crossed the line. He’d have some solace in wearing the yellow jersey for the final Corsican stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On that day, we had another upset. This time, it was in the form of a reduced sprint that saw A-lister Peter Sagan beaten by experienced Aussie Simon Gerrans in a bike throw for the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given how good these three days of racing were, it’s a surprise we haven’t been back to Corsica. It still has that tourism factor, but without the need for a discussion over how silly it is to start the Tour de France in a foreign land.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

The region is packed with hills, has a rich cycling history and boasts one of the most <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-de-france-fans-2023\">vibrant sets of fans in the sport</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the talk before the race was about the expected duel between Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard. The Slovenian came into the race with a wrist brace, having recovered from an injury sustained in the Ardennes Classics earlier in the year. We got a slice of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vingegaard-rivalry\">Vingegaard vs Pogačar </a>as early as Stage 1, when the two juked it out on the Côte de Pike, with Victor Lafay in tow. Pogačar would have the last laugh when his new teammate Adam Yates flew off the front with his twin brother in the finale, meaning the brothers would contest the stage and the first <em>maillot jaune</em> of the 2023 edition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GC would reignite the following day, with Pogačar drawing blood once again on the Jaizkibel. The final descent saw attack after attack from top-drawer favourites, only for Victor Lafay to launch a plucky attack in the final kilometre to take the win ahead of a frustrated Wout van Aert, who was seen throwing his bottle in anger after the finish. A surprise winner indeed, Lafay brushed the dust off the champagne bottle that was allegedly being stored in the back of Cofidis’s team car since their last Tour win in 2008.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of action, the Basque Grand Départ was good bang for their buck. When else have we seen the two main GC contenders attacking each other on the opening two days of racing? Throw in barrages of fans and a route filled with iconic climbs, and we’re onto a winner (almost).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Yorkshire, Tour de France 2014</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/05130451/ofs_tdf2014_stage1_53_voigt_2014_tour_de_france-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"ofs_tdf2014_stage1_53_voigt_2014_tour_de_france\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the midst of Britain’s cycling boom, the Tour de France came to Blighty in 2014. After two consecutive Tour victories, and with Team Sky at the top of their game, British cycling was understandably at fever pitch. Even Princes William and Harry were rolled out for the flag drop, with prime minister David Cameron in attendance for Stage 1’s finale in Harrogate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first two stages in Yorkshire, you could barely see the drystone walls through the ranks of fans who had turned out to cheer on lone escapee Jens Voigt in the Yorkshire Dales. At the end of the stage, in his mother’s hometown of Harrogate, Cavendish crashed in the final hundred metres, putting an end to a dream day one for the Manxman. Instead, it would be Marcel Kittel who’d take the win ahead of a sprinting Chris Froome in sixth place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second day was equally as packed, with staple Yorkshire climbs like Holme Moss on the agenda. During the final ramps of the stage, we even saw Chris Froome, Alberto Contador and Vincenzo Nibali – all considered red-hot GC favourites – attack each other on a residential street of Sheffield. What a sight to behold. Nibali would head out of the pack on the hectic run through the steel city, securing his first ever Tour stage. Little did we know, this would be the beginning of his dominant 2014 Tour, in which he would wear the yellow jersey for all bar two stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of action, fan-factor and route novelty, the 2014 Grand Départ in Yorkshire and London comes out on top. Its success was evident, as Tour honcho Christian Prudhomme claimed it to be the best in years. It’s therefore no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/our-perfect-british-grand-depart\">the Tour will be coming back to the UK in 2027</a>. Now that Scotland and Wales have been pencilled in for their Grand Tour debuts in two years’ time, could that Grand Départ be even better than 2014?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'get your regular dose of Cyclist, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grand-depart-ranking\">The 10 best Grand Tour foreign Grand Départs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a16b520b1729a22343e7637c6e4bfaa08894c44103d09063afbba51e43b5ad64","category":"Cycling"}
