At Anker you can get up to 25 percent off your order when you buy four or more products, and on Amazon you can save up to $18 on Eufy Security Smart Trackers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/eufy-yellow.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStarting with the Eufy trackers, Amazon has both the Smart Track Link in various bundles and the Smart Track Card on sale with various on-page coupons. In order to see the deal prices, all you need to do is clip the coupons on each accessory's product page (located next to the \"Save More\" banner) and then head to checkout.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese accessories work similar to Apple's AirTag, letting you track items like your bag or wallet through compatibility with Apple's Find My app. Shoppers should note that due to the steep discount on the Smart Track Link (2-Pack), this accessory has the best deal price and is only $1 more than the 1-Pack option. Because of this sale, it is also cheaper to place two separate orders for the 2-Pack if you want four of the trackers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Smart Track Link</strong>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B8GDXPBL%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY_1680703206822\">Smart Track Link (1-Pack)</a> - $16.99, down from $19.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BNVFJMZR%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY_1680703060697\">Smart Track Link (2-Pack)</a> - $17.99, down from $35.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BN86R2HC%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY_1680703194427\">Smart Track Link (4-Pack)</a> - $59.99, down from $69.99</li></ul>\r<br />\n<strong>Smart Track Card</strong>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BKJZ5BVF%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.1WJ4SELSMJDKS%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.1WJ4SELSMJDKS_1680703242090\">Smart Track Card (1-Pack)</a> - $19.99, down from $29.99</li></ul> Over at Anker, you can save up to 25 percent with the purchase of four or more of the company's best power banks, chargers, power strips, cables, and hubs.
