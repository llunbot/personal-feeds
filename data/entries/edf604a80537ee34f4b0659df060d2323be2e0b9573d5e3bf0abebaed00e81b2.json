Another way is building 3D chips, which squeeze more transistors into the same area without making transistors smaller. Kim’s team did both, building a 3D chip out of vertically stacked 2D semiconductors.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/making-a-3d-stack-of-transistors-made-from-2d-materials/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/making-a-3d-stack-of-transistors-made-from-2d-materials/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"edf604a80537ee34f4b0659df060d2323be2e0b9573d5e3bf0abebaed00e81b2","category":"Tech"}
