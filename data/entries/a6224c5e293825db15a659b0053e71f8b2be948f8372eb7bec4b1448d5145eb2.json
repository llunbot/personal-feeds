A Macworld reader resized their main volume to 369GB to set up a Boot Camp partition, but then realized it was too small. They wondered how to fix this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the right circumstance, you can simply follow these steps without having to back up the entire drive, erase and reformat it, and add new partitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Always back up your drive before attempting to resize partitions in case something goes wrong, or you accidentally click to proceed on a destructive operation.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Disk Utility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the disk (not the volume) in the left-hand lists of disks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the <em>Partitions</em> button.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can now delete other partitions (select and click the – button), and type in the new size of your main partition in its Size field.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Warning!</strong> Click <em>Apply</em> to proceed, and Disk Utility will warn you whether it will be a destructive operation, deleting the partition’s data and re-creating, or not. If it’s non-destructive, proceed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t found a complete consistency in which drives have non-destructive resizable partitions or not. You can read a lot of detail about macOS drive partitioning, and still find that a volume that meets all the parameters for resizing without erasing, and still be told by Disk Utility that the partition will be erased.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Monterey-repartition.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Monterey repartition\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Monterey-repartition.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Monterey-repartition.jpg?resize=300%2C162&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Monterey-repartition.jpg?resize=768%2C415&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Monterey-repartition.jpg?resize=1200%2C648&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Monterey-repartition.jpg?resize=1536%2C829&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"648\" /><figcaption><p>Disk Utility lets you resize partitions, but it can be hard to predict whether this will require erasing the partition or not until you click Apply.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to erase to repartition, you should make a full clone of the drive, then boot from macOS Recovery and use Disk Utility in that mode to repartition, which will keep macOS Recovery intact if it’s a startup volume.
