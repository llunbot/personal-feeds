The smartphone looked ordinary to start: a slab of OLED with a chassis that's a bold orange on the backside. But Valasek quickly bent the phone into an arch shape, where it stood on her hand before she wrapped it around her wrist like a cuff.</p>\n<p>The phone seemed to adapt to its new positioning rapidly, quickly showing a large clock, making the device feel like a smartwatch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978561#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978561&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5c2e67bc6d3c37aa44a3815031b1e28878f806d05b1934e54c5b5d38d772a4bd","category":"Tech"}
