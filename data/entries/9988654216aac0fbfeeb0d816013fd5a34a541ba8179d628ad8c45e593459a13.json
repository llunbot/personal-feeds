SARS-CoV-2's explosive viral transmission and the health restrictions that followed drastically disrupted the spread and cycles of other infectious diseases, with seasonal flu being no exception.</p>\n<p>The 2020-2021 flu season was virtually nonexistent, and the genetic diversity of circulating flu strains dramatically collapsed. But the B/Yamagata lineage looks to have taken the hardest hit. While other strains rebounded in the years since, causing an early and fierce 2022-2023 flu season in the US, B/Yamagata remains missing globally, appearing extinct.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972394#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972394&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9988654216aac0fbfeeb0d816013fd5a34a541ba8179d628ad8c45e593459a13","category":"Tech"}
