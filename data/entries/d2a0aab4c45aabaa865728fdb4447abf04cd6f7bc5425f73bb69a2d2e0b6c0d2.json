You might see “Unable to\nCommunicate with Apple Watch” if you try to unlock your iPhone\nwhile wearing a face mask, or you might not be able to set up\nUnlock with Apple Watch.</p>\n\n<p>This issue will be fixed in an upcoming software update. Until the\nupdate is available, you can turn off Unlock with Apple Watch and\nuse your passcode to unlock your iPhone 13.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven’t seen this issue, but I sympathize with those of you who’ve been hit by it. “Unlock With Apple Watch” almost completely mitigates the annoyance of using an iPhone with Face ID while wearing a mask.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/27/apple-watch-unlock-iphone-13\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d2a0aab4c45aabaa865728fdb4447abf04cd6f7bc5425f73bb69a2d2e0b6c0d2","category":"Tech"}
