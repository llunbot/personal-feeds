{"title":"★ If Anyone Needed Further Proof, Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times Is Now a Propaganda Rag (and They’re Bad at HTML)","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/soon-shiong_la_times_propaganda_rag","date":1738430331000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times\">Editors note from The New Republic</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As The New Republic <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/191007/la-times-robert-f-kennedy-jr-donald-trump\">reported on Friday</a>, The Los Angeles\nTimes — currently in a race to the bottom <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/188445/washington-post-bezos-trump-failure\">with The Washington\nPost</a> to determine which of the two venerable institutions\ncan sell out to Donald Trump the hardest — found itself in a\nfresh controversy after contributor Eric Reinhart accused the\npaper of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform\">making significant edits</a> to a piece of his that\nwas largely critical of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. into one that\ndepicted the president’s pick to run the Department of Health and\nHuman Services with an “optimistic tone,” largely “ suggesting\nthat the virulent conspiracy theorist could be an answer and\nsolution to the American public’s bubbling resentment toward the\nhealth care industry.”</p>\n\n<p>Reinhart exposed the shady goings-on on X (fka Twitter). “Editing\nout the most urgent point of an OpEd in the minutes before sending\nto press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest\nan argument entirely opposite to the author’s clear intent is\npretty shitty,” <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/ericreinhart.bsky.social/post/3lh2ell45722u\">he wrote</a>. In light of this lamentable\njournalistic malpractice, The New Republic has agreed to run\nReinhart’s piece as he intended it to be read.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reinhart’s headline at TNR, encapsulating the intended thrust of his piece: “<a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times\">RFK Jr’s Wrecking Ball Won’t Fix Public Health</a>”, and the closing paragraph of the column:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although RFK, Jr., and Luigi Mangione are both responses to the\nsame underlying problem of US healthcare corruption, there is a\nmajor difference between them: one allegedly operated outside the\nlaw to kill one person in defense of millions, whereas the other — via his egomaniacal <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/\">disregard</a> for scientific evidence — seeks to use law itself to inflict preventable death on those\nmillions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The headline the LA Times ran his piece under, after their editing: “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform\">Trump’s Healthcare Disruption Could Pay Off — if He Pushes Real Reform</a>”, and its closing paragraphs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Such an approach would shift us away from overreliance on\nexpensive medical treatments and toward public health as it should\nbe: a project by and for <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/152/4/245/118232/Empowering-the-Extra-Ordinary\">the people</a> that makes full use\nof government resources to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/02/24/fixing-public-health-systems-revolution-physicians-take-backseat/\">empower communities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We should demand fundamental transformations in how we approach\nhealth in America, but a wrecking ball alone won’t deliver what\nwe need.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After all the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post\">shenanigans</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/owner-patrick-soon-shiong-is-tanking-the-la-times\">Soon-Shiong began pulling</a> pre- <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/soon-shiong-la-times\">and post-election</a>, my only question here is whether Reinhart really believed the LA Times op-ed page was going to run his piece as written.</p>\n\n<h2>Super-Nerdy Bonus Material</h2>\n\n<p>My original intention for this post ended above. I wanted to quote the TNR editors note that explained the situation, quote Reinhart’s intended headline and closing paragraph, and contrast those with the benign gibberish headline and closing that the LA Times actually published. Done. But I’ve got more. Turns out, the LA Times itself effectively published <em>proof</em> of its “editing” that completely perverted Reinhart’s intended thrust. </p>\n\n<p>I have a small arsenal of homegrown tools I use to automate the work of writing DF. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a> itself is the crown jewel of them. But over the now many years I’ve been doing this I’ve created a whole toolbox of smalls scripts and macros that help me do what I do faster and with fewer errors. (And I still commit plenty of errors.) One of the smaller ones that I’ve never shared publicly (but probably <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/\">should</a>) is a Keyboard Maestro macro that lets me select a range of text in Safari and copy that selection as Markdown-formatted text. It picks up spans of italics and boldfacing, but most importantly, it picks up hyperlinks in the original text and converts them to the Markdown link style I prefer (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link\">defined reference links</a>).</p>\n\n<p>You will note in my blockquote above of Reinhart’s intended closing paragraph, as published at The New Republic, he linked the word “disregard” to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/\">this January 28 report from The Washington Post</a>: “RFK Jr. Disparaged Vaccines Dozens of Times in Recent Years and Made Baseless Claims on Race”. No link to that Washington Post report appears, visually, in the butchered version of Reinhart’s piece that ran in the LA Times.</p>\n\n<p>But, my “Copy Markdown Blockquote” macro picked up an effectively invisible-to-the-user link to that article, in the HTML markup between their closing paragraph and Reinhart’s author bio beneath it. You can view source at the LA Times website and see for yourself, but here’s a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/la-times-reinhart-html-screenshot.png\">\n  <img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/la-times-reinhart-html-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the HTML source code from latimes.com, showing an empty anchor tag whose ‘href’ attribute links to the Washington Post.\" width=\"525\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>You can’t see the link or click on it as rendered in a browser, because there’s no content between the opening <code>&lt;a …&gt;</code> and closing <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags, but whoever at the LA Times edited Reinhart’s column to pervert its meaning, did so sloppily, leaving behind at least this one acerbic vestigial link from his originally-submitted prose.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c1db966bce192294d572af1d6934fe15300e070ee515f23e90ca468a4a856053","category":"Tech"}
