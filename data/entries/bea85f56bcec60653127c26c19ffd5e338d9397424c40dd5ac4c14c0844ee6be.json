For generations, drivers have gotten used to being able to refuel their cars in five minutes using energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons, and plenty of them balk at the idea of having to drive a car where recharging a battery takes half an hour or more.

Called the \"super e-platform,\" the new batteries are able to charge at 10C, and the new DC chargers peak at 1,000 kW. BYD says this will add 249 miles (400 km) of range in just five minutes. By contrast, most current Tesla Superchargers peak at 250 kW, with Electrify America's chargers maxing out at 350 kW, and even the powerful new chargers used by Formula E <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/600-kw-fast-charging-pitstops-are-coming-to-formula-e/\">can only reach 600 kW</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Our goal is to make EV charging as fast as refueling a gasoline car,\" said BYD chairperson Wang Chuanfu.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/new-ev-battery-boasts-5-min-charge-time-adding-250-miles-of-range/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/new-ev-battery-boasts-5-min-charge-time-adding-250-miles-of-range/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
