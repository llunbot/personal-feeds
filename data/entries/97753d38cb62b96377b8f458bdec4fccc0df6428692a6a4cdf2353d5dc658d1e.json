{"title":"Red rock rollin’: Utah, USA Gravel Ride","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/moab-utah-cycling","date":1707219826000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/moab-utah-cycling\">Red rock rollin’: Utah, USA Gravel Ride</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a type of man to whom time and lifestyle bestows a certain kind of hair. Matt has this hair, a wonderful snowy bulb offset by the deep tan of a life spent outdoors. Matt hands my bike up to Dave, who is stood on top of the Ford Excursion; Dave square-jawed, ex-military and easily 6ft 5in; the Excursion a true American also, with seats like sofas and wheels like a tractor. At 4.30am Matt’s sun-visor seems comically redundant, his easy smile in stark contrast to my stinging eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The duo work for Rim Tours, Matt as owner, Dave as guide, and our objective in being up so early and starting this ride not on our bikes but in the truck is to reach the canyons in time to see the sun rise. For any prospective Moab gravel rider, a self-supported day is feasible, but the going rate in a town where 5,000 locals support five million adventuring tourists annually is that you ride as part of a tour group. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mount-caro-catalonia-cycling\">Gateway to Hell: Catalonia Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/babadag-turkey-cycling\">The giant killer: Turkey Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/greece-epirus-cycling\">The forgotten world of Epirus: Greece Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The wilds can be pretty wild. Blowing a tubeless tyre out here could result in the plot for a moderately successful survival film. In fact, Aron Ralston, who hacked off his own arm after it got stuck under a boulder (an incident portrayed in the movie <em>127 Hours</em>), was hiking nearby in Bluejohn Canyon.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Moab Utah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>We arrive in Dead Horse Point State Park just before sunrise.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Beyond the city limits we are the only visible light save for the returning flashes of nocturnal creatures’ eyes.

Even with the lights on full beam I have no idea how on earth Matt can see where he’s going, let alone where I am. He and Dave seem nice, but I wonder at how trusting one can be when a couple of blokes say they can drive you out to the desert in the middle of the night to ride bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We come to a stop in a cloud of dust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gold in them hills</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Moab Utah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>‘Gooseneck’, a stretch of the Colorado River so named for its shape.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A half halo of sun peeps over the horizon, tentative at first, then gathering momentum to illuminate the desert in a blaze of orange. Sandstone mountains are seemingly pulled from the floor by the sun and set aglow like a four-bar fire. It is breathtaking in the way I imagine early settlers found such sites breathtaking after weeks on the wagon, a vast array of flat-topped mountains – called mesas – flanked by a snaking canyon irrepressibly carved by the Colorado River. Millennia ago this was all under water, and you can see how.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikes unloaded and kit checked, Matt pulls away, leaving us to ride into the mountains. I’d wager we are the only humans here for miles in every direction, and I’m suddenly overcome with the sheer enormity of the desert and my speck of a place in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave is less overwhelmed, and cheerily points left then right at two distant promontories: ‘Thelma and Louise drive their car off that one at the end of the film. That one over there is where the park gets its name.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Moab Utah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Moab is famous for its sheer red sandstone cliffs, which form the edges of plateaus, flattop mountains called mesas, and buttes, which are like very narrow mesas. Thus ends the lesson.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Apparently cowboys used these canyons to catch mustangs, which they’d drive down a sliver of land called ‘the neck’ and onto a mesa. Since the sides of a mesa are so sheer the horses couldn’t escape; all the cowboys had to do was fence off the neck and they gone done got themselves a natural corral. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would then select the best horses and free the unwanted ‘broomtails’. Except, one day, whether accidentally or deliberately (it has been mooted the horses competed for food with ranchers’ livestock), the cowboys left the fence closed, leaving the broomtails to perish. This is an area whose temperatures can rise as high as 46°C, drop as low as -31°C and which gets an average of ten inches of rain a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dead Horse Point State Park was thus tragically born.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Moab Utah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Pedalling on, I marvel at how much Americans always seem to know about where they are. I could barely tell you why the United Kingdom is called the United Kingdom but Dave – who actually moved here from Texas after falling for Matt’s business partner (and his old girlfriend; Moab is a small town), Kirstin – is a historical font.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moab, Dave explains, is a town built on mining. First potash, used in fertiliser, which is still drawn out of mines with water from the Colorado River then left to evaporate in vast blue ponds. Later uranium, which was bought up fervently by the US Government in the 1940s and 1950s for use in nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Moab Utah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/big-ride-moab-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Slickrock as far as the eye can see, Moab’s famous lumpy sandstone polished until near smooth by sandblasting winds.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The uranium boom was like Moab’s Gold Rush,’ says Dave. ‘They got rich.

Form an orderly queue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A big thank you to Vicky Brabin of KBC PR &amp; Marketing and Taylor Hartman of Visit Utah (<a href=\"https://www.visitutah.com/\" target=\"_blank\">visitutah.com</a>) for their perfect logistical planning.
