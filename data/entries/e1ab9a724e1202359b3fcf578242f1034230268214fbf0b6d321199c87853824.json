There does not appear to be any kind of secondary scanning mechanism to separately capture a user's glasses, and instead, Apple will allow users to \"Select Eyewear\" from a variety of options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/vision-pro-persona-glasses.jpg\" alt width=\"1390\" height=\"708\" />\r<br />\n‌visionOS‌ code suggests that Vision Pro users will be able to choose from a range of different glasses and sunglasses options that come in common shapes like square, rounded, oval, aviator, and more, with thick and thin frames.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/wG7xbR6RL6\">pic.twitter.com/wG7xbR6RL6</a></p>— M1 (@M1Astra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1710046954661527951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nUsers will likely be able to find something that is close to their own frames, but there may not be an exact match available. It is not yet clear if color options will be available, but it seems like a level of customization that Apple would offer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple uses the Vision Pro cameras to bring a user's facial expressions and hand movements to their Persona, giving it a more realistic feel that mimics person-to-person interactions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPersonas are one aspect of ‌visionOS‌ that Apple is working on perfecting before the launch of the Vision Pro headset. In September, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-vision-pro-developer-survey/\">began surveying developers</a> who have the Vision Pro about their Personas, soliciting opinions on facial expressions, appearance matching, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro headset is set to launch in early 2024 in the United States, and it will be priced at $3,500.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-vision-pro-persona-glasses/\">Apple Vision Pro Personas Have to Wear Generic Glasses</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-personas-have-to-wear-generic-glasses.2406505/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e1ab9a724e1202359b3fcf578242f1034230268214fbf0b6d321199c87853824","category":"Apple"}
