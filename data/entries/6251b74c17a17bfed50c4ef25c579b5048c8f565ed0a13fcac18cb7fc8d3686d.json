England, Scotland, and Wales are all set to host stages of the Tour in 2027, with the men’s Grand Départ confirmed to be taking place in the Scottish capital and further details of the routes for both the men’s and women’s to be announced in the autumn. It is the first time that men’s and women’s Tours have started in the same country (outside France). </span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>When the men’s peloton rolls out of Edinburgh in July 2027, 13 years will have passed since the last Tour visit to the UK. Expressing his delight at the 2027 Grand Départ, Christian Prudhomme, General Director, Tour de France, said: \"The Tour de France and the UK share a rich history.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Thousands of fans lined the roadsides of Yorkshire and London in 2014 and the prospect of Tadej Pogačar and Demi Vollering riding through Britain’s diverse landscapes will incite every cycling fan to do the same thing in 2027. The UK has the roads, landscapes and passion to create some unforgettable Tour stages, something which the First Ministers of Scotland, John Swinney, and Wales, Eluned Morgan are hoping can translate to non-cycling fans. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Swinney said it was “a tremendous honour” for Scotland, which hosted the Worlds in 2023, to host the Grand Départ. Morgan, who wants to showcase Wales as a top destination for cyclists, as well as inspire people to take up the sport said: “Boasting stunning landscapes, warm and welcoming communities and an ever-growing fanbase of cycling enthusiasts, Wales will provide the ultimate challenge and a unique Welsh ‘Croeso’ for the world’s biggest cycle race.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>For British Cycling, inspiration seems to be the name of the game, with Jon Dutton OBE, CEO, saying: “Hosting both the men’s and women’s races together will be a first, and we believe it has the potential to inspire more people to discover the joy and benefits of cycling. This is not just about the race – it’s about creating a national moment that encourages healthier lifestyles, supports cycle tourism, and brings communities together.\" </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>British Cycling, UK Sport, UK Government, Scottish and Welsh Governments have collaborated to make the event happen and have said a social impact programme will be delivered as part of the build-up, which will deliver long-lasting benefits by tackling inactivity, improving mental wellbeing, boosting economic growth and supporting communities to thrive.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Untitled_design_49_1024x1024.png?v=1742399981\" alt=\"The Tour de France in Yorkshire in 2014\" /></span><span></span><em>The Tour de France in Yorkshire in 2014 (Photograph: SWpix)</em><em></em></p>\n<h3><span>Inspiration not enough to revive dwindling UK racing scene</span></h3>\n<p><span>Like at Yorkshire 2014, the Worlds in Harrogate in 2019 and again in Glasgow in 2023, the Tour will inspire British people - be it the next generation of elite riders, newbies to the sport, or current fans.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>However, inspiration only gets people so far; the UK has plenty of young talent and appetite but the riders face far greater barriers than their European counterparts to make it to elite level. A lot has changed since the 2014 Grand Départ in Yorkshire, in which time the opportunities for British riders to race at home have dried up.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>The Tour de Yorkshire, which ended 2019 was meant to be the legacy of the Yorkshire Grand Départ. Likewise, the Tour Series ended in 2023 after 14 years of criterium races in town centres, and the The RideLondon Classique was put on hold this year, meaning after a golden spell of domestic high-level racing opportunities, UK riders are now facing similar obstacles that their country-men and -women had to tackle last century, needing  to race - and often live - abroad because there are not enough races for them in the UK. Very few professional cyclists on the men’s and women’s WorldTour live in the UK, but living abroad is often not an option for younger riders and ‘the next generation’ especially given the added complications since Britain left the European Union in 2020.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Without the foundations of a stable racing calendar and pathways for young cyclists, the sport could lose talented athletes to other sports, which face fewer barriers. Cycling has always been a niche sport in the UK, competing against football, boxing and rugby for both fan numbers and also participants. Put simply, sportspeople can be world-class at football, boxing, rugby, athletics, swimming and gymnastics, to name a few, and stay in the UK where there are elite-level competitions.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>However, it is not all doom and gloom, as unlike these other sports, cycling is unique in that, besides travel, it is free to spectate live. Simon Morton, Director of Events at UK Sport speaking about the Grand Départ in 2027 said: “This will be the biggest free spectator event ever hosted in the UK, offering the public front row access to world class sport across villages, towns and cities.” While being able to watch the race live is certainly a positive,  what is built on the inspiration of the 2027 Grand Départ afterwards will determine the success of cycling. The platform is already there, all it now needs is the investment. </span><b></b></p>\n<h3><span>Women’s cycling leading the way</span></h3>\n<p><span>A lot may have changed since the Yorkshire Grand Départ but one of the most positive things is the rise of women’s cycling in the UK. In 2014, a women’s Tour de France was a pipedream, let alone a Grand Départ in Britain.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Although the number of British UCI teams reduced from six to four this year and despite facing the same challenges of a dwindling domestic racing scene, objectively UK women’s elite cycling is in a better place than it was in 2014. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>The Tour de France Femmes starting in the UK should further encourage future female riders and fans to get involved in the sport. Culture Secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “Staging the Tour de France Femmes in Britain for the first time will also be an historic occasion and inspire the next generation of female cyclists while supporting our mission of breaking down barriers for women and girls to get more involved in sport.\"</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>From Zoe Bäckstedt to Cat Ferguson, there is a whole host of talent in the UK cycling scene currently, but imagine how many more British cyclists would be in the professional ranks, if there were more opportunities to race at home. Hopefully with the Tour de France heading to Britain, this will lead to a revival of a dying race scene in the country. While bringing top-level sportspeople to race in the UK sets an example, it’s not enough for long-term change. Big promises have been made by key stakeholders about what the Grand Départ will do for the sport of cycling, but a long term approach is needed to bring about a real difference.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"6251b74c17a17bfed50c4ef25c579b5048c8f565ed0a13fcac18cb7fc8d3686d","category":"Cycling"}
