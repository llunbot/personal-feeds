The functionality will build on the widget options that Apple added to the Lock Screen in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple wants to make iPhones more useful when they're not being actively used and are positioned on a desk or nightstand. Apple plans to use a dark background with lighter color text to make the information on the display easy to read.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is developing a horizontal interface for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> as well, but that may not be ready to launch in ‌iOS 17‌, and the company is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/\">working on a low-cost tablet</a> that would magnetically attach to walls and stands to serve as a dedicated home hub.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 17‌ is set to be announced at the June 5 keynote event that kicks off the 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference.
