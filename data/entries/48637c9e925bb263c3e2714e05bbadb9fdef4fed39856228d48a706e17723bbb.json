Higgins had been called in to discuss how Verizon \"always\" preinstalled Google's Chrome browser with Google search on its mobile phones. The public was able to hear 30 minutes of testimony before they were removed from the court.</p>\n<p>But it looks like the DOJ doesn’t plan to sit back and let Google seal off all the testimony it wants. Today, the DOJ objected when the court removed the public during discussions of Google's online advertising pricing, Reuters reported, pushing back against what Google considers privileged information.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969165#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969165&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"48637c9e925bb263c3e2714e05bbadb9fdef4fed39856228d48a706e17723bbb","category":"Tech"}
