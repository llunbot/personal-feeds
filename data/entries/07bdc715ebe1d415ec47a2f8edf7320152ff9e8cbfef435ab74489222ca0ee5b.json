In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/791082/13-inch-macbook-pro-m2-review.html\">review</a>, we praised the MacBook Pro’s “sustained performance” and battery life and called it a “good, solid laptop.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that review, we admitted that there are numerous reasons why the MacBook Air and higher-end MacBook Pros are a smarter purchase, but none of them will give you the Touch Bar. So if you want one, this is your last chance to get one.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"07bdc715ebe1d415ec47a2f8edf7320152ff9e8cbfef435ab74489222ca0ee5b","category":"Apple"}
