On Thursday, Apple made a public statement about the lawsuit, stating that the bands are “Safe for users to wear.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit cites a University of Notre Dame <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00907?goto=supporting-info&amp;articleRef=test\">study</a> that found that 15 of 22 watch bands tested contain toxic polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The PFAS can be absorbed through the skin, eventually leading to health problems. The published study cites ten companies whose bands were tested (including Apple, Nike, Google, and Fitbit), but the published results use labels that don’t specifically identify the band and model of the band tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bands cited in the lawsuit are the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXM23AM/A/46mm-black-sport-band-s-m\">Sport Band</a> (the band included with a new Apple Watch), the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MYPD3AM/A/49mm-black-ocean-band-black-titanium-finish\">Ocean Band</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC1W4AM/A/40mm-pure-platinum-nike-sport-band-m-l\">Nike Sport Band</a>. The lawsuit states that Apple “continues to hide the existence of PFAS at the point of purchase and otherwise.” You can find a copy of the lawsuit below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>Apple issued a response to the lawsuit:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple Watch bands are safe for users to wear. In addition to our own testing, we also work with independent laboratories to conduct rigorous testing and analysis of the materials used in our products, including Apple Watch bands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2022, Apple published a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_PFAS_Commitment_November-2022.pdf\">white paper about its phasing out of PFAS</a> in its products. In the Executive Summary of the paper, Apple states that it wants to “thoughtfully phase out PFAS in a way that does not result in regrettable substitutions” and that the company is “prioritizing our phaseout activities on applications that result in the highest volumes of PFAS reductions and the most meaningful environmental impact.” The Apple paper does not address PFAS in specific Apple Watch bands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cavalier-krzyzek-vs-appl.pdf\">Apple Watch band class action lawsuit</a><a href=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cavalier-krzyzek-vs-appl.pdf\">Downloa</a></div>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"32667ddb2da3d82bb5e9a31277280b517d5889f2358f47728bee52e8be5b212b","category":"Apple"}
