Developers interested in contingent pricing can sign up to get notified when more details are available in January.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-app-store-bundle-subscription-discounts/\">Apple Tests App Store Bundle Subscription Discounts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tests-app-store-bundle-subscription-discounts.2414029/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d309bbaa26373dcf8505aa11c570ba5fed5657d50e2244a12a582ee80c8b927","category":"Apple"}
