{"title":"Accelerate operational analytics with Amazon Q Developer in Amazon OpenSearch Service","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/accelerate-operational-analytics-with-amazon-q-developer-in-amazon-opensearch-service/","date":1743455330000,"content":"<p>Today, I’m happy to announce <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\">Amazon Q Developer</a> support for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/\">Amazon OpenSearch Service</a>, providing AI-assisted capabilities to help you investigate and visualize operational data. Amazon Q Developer enhances the OpenSearch Service experience by reducing the learning curve for query languages, visualization tools, and alerting features. The new capabilities complement existing dashboards and visualizations by enabling natural language exploration and pattern detection. After incidents, you can rapidly create additional visualizations to strengthen your monitoring infrastructure. This enhanced workflow accelerates incident resolution and optimizes engineering resource usage, helping you focus more time on innovation rather than troubleshooting.</p> \n<p>Amazon Q Developer in Amazon OpenSearch Service improves operational analytics by integrating natural language exploration and generative AI capabilities directly into OpenSearch workflows. During incident response, you can now quickly gain context on alerts and log data, leading to faster analysis and resolution times. When alert monitors trigger, Amazon Q Developer provides summaries and insights directly in the alerts interface, helping you understand the situation quickly without waiting for specialists or consulting documentation. From there, you can use Amazon Q Developer to explore the underlying data, build visualizations using natural language, and identify patterns to determine root causes. For example, you can create visualizations that break down errors by dimensions such as Region, data center, or endpoint. Additionally, Amazon Q Developer assists with dashboard configuration and recommends anomaly detectors for proactive alerting, improving both initial monitoring setup and troubleshooting efficiency.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Get started with Amazon Q Developer in OpenSearch Service<br /> </strong></span>To get started, I go to my <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/application.html\">OpenSearch user interface</a> and sign in. From the home page, I choose a workspace to test Amazon Q Developer in OpenSearch Service. For this demonstration, I use a preconfigured environment with the sample logs dataset available on the user interface.</p> \n<p>This feature is on by default through the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-free-tier.html\">Amazon Q Developer Free tier</a>, which is also on by default. You can disable the feature by unselecting the <strong>Enable natural language query generation</strong> checkbox under the <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)</strong> section during domain creation or by editing the cluster configuration in console.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/24/LM1262-0.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/24/LM1262-0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3032\" height=\"1562\" /></a></p> \n<p>In OpenSearch Dashboards, I navigate to <strong>Discover</strong> from the left navigation pane. To use natural language to explore the data, I switch to <strong>PPL</strong> language in order to show the prompt box.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-0ac.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-0ac.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3032\" height=\"1144\" /></a></p> \n<p>I choose the <strong>Amazon Q</strong> icon in the main navigation bar to open the Amazon Q panel. You can use this panel to create recommended anomaly detectors to drive alerting and use natural language to generate visualization.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-1b.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-1b.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3032\" height=\"1242\" /></a></p> \n<p>I enter the following prompt in the <strong>Ask a natural language question</strong> text box:</p> \n<p><code>Show me a breakdown of HTTP response codes for the last 24 hours</code></p> \n<p>When results appear, Amazon Q automatically generates a summary of these results. You can control the summary display using the <strong>Show result summarization</strong> option under the Amazon Q panel to hide or show the summary. You can use the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons to provide feedback, and you can copy the summary to your clipboard using the copy button.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-2c.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-2c.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3032\" height=\"1722\" /></a></p> \n<p>Other capabilities of Amazon Q Developer in OpenSearch Service are generating visualizations directly from natural language descriptions, providing conversational assistance for OpenSearch related queries, providing AI-generated summaries and insights for your OpenSearch alerts, and analyzing your data, and suggesting appropriate anomaly detectors.</p> \n<p>Let’s look into how to generate visualizations directly from natural language descriptions. I choose <strong>Generate visualization</strong> from <strong>Amazon Q</strong> panel. I enter <code>Create a bar chart showing the number of requests by HTTP status code</code> in the input field and choose generate.</p> \n<p>To refine the visualization, you can choose <strong>Edit visual</strong> and add style instructions such as <code>Show me a pie chart</code> or <code>Use a light gray background with a white grid</code>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-3a.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/27/LM1262-3a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3032\" height=\"1722\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Now available</strong></span><br /> You can now use Amazon Q Developer in OpenSearch Service to reduce mean time to resolution, enable more self-service troubleshooting, and help teams extract greater value from your observability data.</p> \n<p>The service is available today in US East (N.
