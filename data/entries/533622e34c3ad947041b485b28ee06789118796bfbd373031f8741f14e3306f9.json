These updates are smaller in scale than the recent 17.4 updates, but we're still finding some interesting changes in them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/top-stories-6apr2024.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the wait for new iPads continues, and it appears we've got around another month before we'll see them released. Other news this week included a iPhone 16 display rumor, details on upcoming Beats Solo 4 headphones, and the release of more immersive spatial Personas for Apple Vision Pro, so read on below for all the details!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Here's Everything New in iOS 17.5 Beta 1</h2>\r<br />\nApple this week made the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/\">first betas of iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a> available to developers and public beta testers. The upcoming software updates include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/everything-new-in-ios-17-5-beta-1/\">only a few new user-facing features</a> for the iPhone and iPad so far, but hidden code changes reveal some additional possibilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWe have put together a list of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/everything-new-in-ios-17-5-beta-1/\">everything discovered in the first iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas</a>, including code changes related to a Battery Health menu coming to the iPad, a new Apple Pencil, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 will likely be released to the public in May.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature Even Thinner Bezels</h2>\r<br />\nFor the second time in as many months, it has been rumored that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/\">at least some iPhone 16 models will feature even thinner bezels around the screen</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe higher-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to feature larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, but the thinner bezels could result in the devices having only modestly larger dimensions compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Suppliers Say New iPads Have Been 'Repeatedly Postponed'</h2>\r<br />\nIt has been <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">nearly 18 months since Apple last updated its iPad lineup</a>, and customers are anxiously waiting for new models to be announced. For months, there have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">rumors about new iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-ipad-air/\">iPad Air models</a>, but the estimated timeframe for their release has been repeatedly pushed back from March to April <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/\">to May</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn defense of these rumors, it does sound like the new iPads have indeed experienced delays, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-suppliers-say-new-ipads-repeatedly-postponed/\">some Apple suppliers say production of related components has been \"repeatedly postponed.\"</a>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPadOS 17.5 Beta Hints at Battery Capacity and Cycle Count Menu on Upcoming iPads</h2>\r<br />\nApple may be planning to expand the iPhone's Battery Health menu to upcoming iPads, based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/\">evidence uncovered in the iPadOS 17.5 beta</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPad-Battery-Feature.jpg\" width=\"1990\" height=\"1120\" />\r<br />\nThe first iPadOS 17.5 beta includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/\">several new references to a Battery Health menu on the iPad</a>, but the feature is not actually visible yet, and it may be exclusive to upcoming iPads. The menu is expected to show an iPad battery's maximum remaining capacity and cycle count.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Beats Solo 4 to Feature Improved Sound, USB-C</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/new-beats-solo-4-to-feature-improved-sound-usb-c/\">New features and details for the rumored Beats Solo 4</a> surfaced this week, shortly after the headphones appeared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-beats-solo-4-headphones/\">in the FCC database</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/new-beats-solo-4.jpg\" width=\"1129\" height=\"635\" />\r<br />\nKey features expected for the Beats Solo 4 include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/new-beats-solo-4-to-feature-improved-sound-usb-c/\">improved sound quality, a USB-C charging port, and up to 50 hours of battery life for music playback</a>. Like the Beats Solo 3 headphones that launched in 2016, the Solo 4 are expected to cost $199 in the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Testing the Apple Vision Pro's New Spatial Personas Feature</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/spatial-personas-beta-coming-to-vision-pro/\">Spatial Personas are now available on Apple's Vision Pro headset</a> in beta capacity. The feature is available on visionOS 1.1 and later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/New-Spatial-Persona-Thumb-2.jpg\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" />\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/testing-vision-pro-spatial-persona/\">recent video</a> on our YouTube channel, we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/testing-vision-pro-spatial-persona/\">tested the new spatial Personas</a>, which \"break out of the familiar FaceTime tile and feel more present\" in the visionOS space compared to the standard Personas that have been available since day one, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/apr-4-2024\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/06/top-stories-ios-17-5-beta/\">Top Stories: iOS 17.5 Beta, The Latest on New iPads, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-17-5-beta-the-latest-on-new-ipads-and-more.2423660/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"533622e34c3ad947041b485b28ee06789118796bfbd373031f8741f14e3306f9","category":"Apple"}
