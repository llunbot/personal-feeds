The Vision Pro requires an appropriately sized Light Seal and Head Band in order to operate as intended.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\n\"You may scan your face to determine your size for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>,\" reads code in the ‌Apple Store‌ app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has already been using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/vision-pro-developer-kit-information/\">a Head Measure and Fit app</a> to help developers testing the Vision Pro to find their correct sizes, so it sounds like similar functionality will be built directly into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. Light Seals and Head Bands come in several sizes, and the option to use a scan to determine a size suggests that customers will not need to visit an Apple retail store to determine the right fit. A facial scan is likely to be part of the process of ordering the Vision Pro online.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro will ship with both a Solo Knit Band and a Dual Loop Band, the latter of which has a second strap that goes over the head to more evenly distribute weight. A Light Seal and two Light Seal Cushions are included as well. Customers who need prescription lens inserts from ZEISS will be able to import their prescriptions from the Health app or upload their prescription.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCode also suggests that Apple may allow the Vision Pro to be engraved, but it is not clear where an engraving might be able to be located.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to launch the Vision Pro on Friday, February 2, but pre-orders for the device will begin on Friday, January 19 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/vision-pro-apple-store-app-face-scan/\">Apple Store App Will Use Face Scan to Determine Apple Vision Pro Size</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-app-will-use-face-scan-to-determine-apple-vision-pro-size.2416102/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f160d2e627515f3b72d65619b630c39f74814e85833218c60f9c1838d5c0692a","category":"Apple"}
