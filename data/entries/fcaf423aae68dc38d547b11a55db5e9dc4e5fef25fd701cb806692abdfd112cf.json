Let's save lives together by encouraging donations of blood, platelets, and plasma. While most blood drives are specific to a geographic location, our blood drive is online and worldwide. Anyone can participate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/blood_drive_2024.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"672\" />\r<br />\nOver the past 14 years, MacRumors Blood Drives have recorded donations of <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/32205640/\">1,305 units of blood, platelets, and plasma</a>, cheered for donors, and celebrated new signups for the organ donor and bone marrow registries. We've heard from hundreds of forum members who donate or whose lives were saved by the donations of strangers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis year's featured donor is user Neil.gtis, a three-year forum member from England. Neil is a regular donor who has made 98 blood donations to date, and will reach his 100th donation this year. Whether you're a regular donor like Neil.gtis or someone overcoming apprehension to donate for the very first time, we congratulate you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/featured_donor_2024.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" />\r<br />\n<h3>How to participate in the MacRumors Blood Drive</h3>\r<br />\n<ol><li>If you are an eligible donor (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/eligibility-requirements.html\">U.S. eligibility rules</a>), schedule a blood, platelet, or plasma donation (<a href=\"https://macrumors.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201729417-Blood-and-Platelet-Donation-\">FAQ</a>) at any donation center near you.
