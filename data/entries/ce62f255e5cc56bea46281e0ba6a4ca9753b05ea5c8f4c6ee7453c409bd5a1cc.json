It was only his third career win. Admittedly, one of those was the queen stage of the Tour de France last year, finishing on top of the iconic alpine pass of Alp d’huez, and there was his nail-biting second place at Amstel Gold. But heck, it was a great start to his 2023 road campaign.</p>\n<p>Since then, things have yet quite to go Pidcock’s way. Unfortunately, on the final stage of Tirreno-Adriatico, Pidcock crashed and has since been diagnosed with a concussion. This, unfortunately for him and his fans who wanted to see a face-off with Remco, meant he didn’t line up for this year’s Milan-San Remo.</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/mathieu-van-der-poel-follows-in-footsteps-of-grandfather-with-solo-milan-san-remo-victory/\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel follows in footsteps of grandfather with solo Milan-San Remo victory</a></p>\n<p>So no Tom action, which was a shame for us all. So to fill that gap, I’d like to bring you a particular someone’s training bike. Yep, I got a little time to check what Mr. Pidcock uses for those long winter miles. And as you’d expect, it isn’t a beat-up old winter stead. Toms got it all, the best of the best.</p>\n<p>Tom and his bike were on hand (by chance) while I attended a recent Pinarello bike launch in Calpe, which has been a favoured training ground for many professionals for years. The specific hotel we were holed up in for the launch seemed to be ground zero for pro cyclists during the off-season. And understandably so, with rooms that allow you to simulate sleeping at altitude and then roll out of the door to train at a low level, it is the ideal concoction for those marginal training gains.</p>\n<p>So let us delve into Mr. Tom’s bike, a Pinarello Dogma with all the kit a professional athlete of his level should expect. Hit that play button.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p> </p>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ce62f255e5cc56bea46281e0ba6a4ca9753b05ea5c8f4c6ee7453c409bd5a1cc","category":"Cycling"}
