Since last week, the state has tallied 10 cases across three counties with more pending.</p>\n<p>On March 13, <a href=\"https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483\">health officials announced the state's first measles case</a> since 2018. The case was reported in Stevens County, which sits in the southwest corner of the state. As of now, it's unclear if the case is connected to the mushrooming outbreak that began in West Texas.</p>\n<p>That initial case in Kansas already shows potential to mushroom on its own. Stevens County contains two school districts, both of which have extremely low vaccination rates among kindergartners. By the time children enter kindergarten, they should have their two doses of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, which together are 97 percent effective against measles. In the 2023–2024 school year, rates of kindergartners with their two shots stood at 83 percent in the Hugoton school district and 80 percent in the Moscow school district, <a href=\"https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2016/Kindergarten-Immunization-Data\">according to state data</a>.
