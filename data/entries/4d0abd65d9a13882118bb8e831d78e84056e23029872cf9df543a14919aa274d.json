Now an international team of astronomers has analyzed an unusual energy peak detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and concluded that it was an emission spectra, according to a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj3638\">new paper</a> published in the journal Science. Per the authors, it's the first high-confidence emission line ever seen in 50 years of studying GRBs.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/its-the-boat-astronomers-observe-brightest-of-all-time-gamma-ray-burst/\">reported previously</a>, gamma-ray bursts are extremely high-energy explosions in distant galaxies lasting between mere milliseconds to several hours. There are two classes of gamma-ray bursts. Most (70 percent) are long bursts lasting more than two seconds, often with a bright afterglow. These are usually linked to galaxies with rapid star formation. Astronomers think that long bursts are tied to the deaths of massive stars collapsing to form a neutron star or black hole (or, alternatively, a newly formed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/behold-the-magnetar-natures-ultimate-superweapon/\">magnetar</a>). The baby black hole would produce jets of highly energetic particles moving near the speed of light, powerful enough to pierce through the remains of the progenitor star, emitting X-rays and gamma rays.</p>\n<p>Those gamma-ray bursts lasting less than two seconds (about 30 percent) are deemed short bursts, usually emitting from regions with very little star formation. Astronomers think these gamma-ray bursts are the result of mergers between two neutron stars, or a neutron star merging with a black hole, comprising a \"kilonova.\" That hypothesis was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.119.161101\">confirmed in 2017</a> when the LIGO collaboration picked up the gravitational wave signal of two neutron stars merging, accompanied by the powerful gamma-ray bursts associated with a kilonova.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039494#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039494&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d0abd65d9a13882118bb8e831d78e84056e23029872cf9df543a14919aa274d","category":"Tech"}
