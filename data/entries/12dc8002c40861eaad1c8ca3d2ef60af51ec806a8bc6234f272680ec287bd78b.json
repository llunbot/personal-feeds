During that time, the threat actors periodically accessed employee mailboxes and network drives in search of chip designs and other NXP intellectual property. The breach wasn’t uncovered until Chimera intruders were detected in a separate company network that connected to compromised NXP systems on several occasions. Details of the breach remained a closely guarded secret until now.</p>\n<h2>No material damage</h2>\n<p>NRC cited a report published (and later deleted) by security firm Fox-IT, titled <a href=\"https://web-archive-org.translate.goog/web/20210620162513/https://blog.fox-it.com/2021/01/12/abusing-cloud-services-to-fly-under-the-radar/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US\"><em>Abusing Cloud Services to Fly Under the Radar</em></a>. It documented Chimera using cloud services from companies including Microsoft and Dropbox to receive data stolen from the networks of semiconductor makers, including one in Europe that was hit in “early Q4 2017.” Some of the intrusions lasted as long as three years before coming to light. NRC said the unidentified victim was NXP.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986661#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986661&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"12dc8002c40861eaad1c8ca3d2ef60af51ec806a8bc6234f272680ec287bd78b","category":"Tech"}
