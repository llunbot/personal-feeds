Virtual machines often run inside hosting environments to prevent one customer from being able to access or control the resources of other customers. By breaking out of one customer’s isolated VM environment, a threat actor could take control of the hypervisor that apportions each VM. From there, the attacker could access the VMs of multiple customers, who often use these carefully controlled environments to host their internal networks.</p>\n<h2>All bets off</h2>\n<p>“If you can escape to the hypervisor you can access every system,” security researcher Kevin Beaumont <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/114105817929595100\">said</a> on Mastodon. “If you can escape to the hypervisor, all bets are off as a boundary is broken.” He <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/114105875482821396\">added</a>: “With this vuln you’d be able to use it to traverse VMware managed hosting providers, private clouds orgs have built on prem etc.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/vmware-patches-3-critical-vulnerabilities-in-multiple-product-lines/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/vmware-patches-3-critical-vulnerabilities-in-multiple-product-lines/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f7bcfee8322bb9f6b3c7812165c4befc14c79ccea7b53a743d23c243b50090a","category":"Tech"}
