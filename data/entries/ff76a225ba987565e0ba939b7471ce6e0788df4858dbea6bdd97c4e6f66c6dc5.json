That's when Kiwi Farms users \"began 'a relentless harassment campaign,'\" Greer alleged, including “direct harassment via phone, email, and social media.\" Kiwi Farms' “schemes\" allegedly \"successfully got him fired from his workplace and evicted” and led to \"the creation of 'false social media profiles that impersonate him with names ... that mock his physical and developmental disabilities.'” Kiwi Farms frequently targets people with physical and mental disabilities, Greer told the court.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977053#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977053&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff76a225ba987565e0ba939b7471ce6e0788df4858dbea6bdd97c4e6f66c6dc5","category":"Tech"}
