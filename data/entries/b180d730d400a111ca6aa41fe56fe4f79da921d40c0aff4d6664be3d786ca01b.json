But what do you do when you no longer want to run the beta?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the beta is causing havoc with your Mac, you are fed up with having to set aside hours each week while the latest update is installed, or you want to keep the most recent stable version rather than spoil things with the next update read on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll run through the simple steps to revert from the macOS Ventura beta to the full version of Ventura, before running through the slightly more complex process for reverting from the macOS Sonoma beta to macOS Ventura.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s the iOS beta program you wish to leave read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">How to remove an iOS beta from your iPhone</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to stop getting the macOS beta </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are still running the Ventura beta (or if you are running Sonoma beta after the full version of Somona has been released) the process to revert to the full version is relatively simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to do is remove yourself from Apple’s macOS beta program as this will stop the beta updates from arriving on your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on General. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Software Update. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the i beside Beta updates and make sure it is set to off.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have left the Beta program the next version of macOS that is offered to you via System Settings will be a full version of macOS and you will be able to install that as usual. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to wait for that next update then you can reinstall macOS Ventura using macOS Recovery. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>To enter Recovery mode press and hold the power button while your Mac starts up and continue to press and hold the button until you see a startup options window appear with an Options icon. (On an older Mac you enter Recovery by pressing the Command and R buttons during start-up).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Options and click Continue.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS Utilities will open with the option to Reinstall macOS [version]. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If this doesn’t work for you then the next option is to wipe your Mac and do a clean install following the steps below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is more advice about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">installing macOS on your Mac here</a> and here’s what to do if you encounter <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671831/macos-monterey-wont-install-fixes.html\">problems installing macOS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to reinstall macOS Ventura after the Sonoma beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having removed your Mac from the Sonoma beta program, you will need to wipe your Mac before you can reinstall macOS Ventura. You won’t be able to install Ventura over the top of Sonoma, unfortunately. This is why we always recommend <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671336/how-to-back-up-a-mac-or-macbook.html\">making a backup</a> before you install a beta, or any newer version of macOS. </p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Leave the beta program </h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Stop-beta-updates-MacOS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Stop beta updates macOS\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>As with the Ventura beta program, the first thing to do is remove yourself from Apple’s macOS Sonoma beta program as this will stop the beta updates from arriving on your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on General. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Software Update. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the i beside Beta updates and make sure it is set to off.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This will stop any further Sonoma updates being installed on your Mac, but if you want to revert back to Ventura you will need to wipe your Mac, as per the instructions below. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Wipe your Mac</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Erase-Mac-M-and-T-chip.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Erase Mac with M or T2 chip\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Unfortunately, if you are moving from macOS Sonoma back to Ventura you will need to erase all the data from your Mac first. You cannot install Ventura on top of Sonoma. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily there is an Erase All Content and Settings option in System Settings that makes it easy to return your Mac to factory settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find the Erase All Content and Settings option open System Settings &gt; General &gt; click on Reset &gt; click Erase All Contents and Settings.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you click on Erase All Content and Settings everything will be taken care of. We run through the process in more detail here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670927/how-to-erase-a-macbook-or-mac-restore-to-factory-settings.html\">How to factory reset a MacBook or Mac</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just note that during the process any Bluetooth keyboards or mice will be disconnected, so if you have wired options they will be helpful. If you don’t have a wired mouse or keyboard you should get an option to connect your Bluetooth peripherals when the Mac restarts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Mac doesn’t have an M-series chip or a T2 chip the process to wipe it is a bit different (and described in the story linked to above). </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Reinstall macOS</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Set-up-new-mac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Set up a New Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Once your Mac has been wiped and reset to factory settings it should restart running the latest full version of macOS that is compatible with your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need to join your Wi-Fi network and connect your mouse and keyboard if they are Bluetooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, you will eventually see an Activate Mac screen.
