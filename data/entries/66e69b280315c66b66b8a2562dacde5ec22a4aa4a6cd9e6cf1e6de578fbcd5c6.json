Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>Badging on the rear of the new Cadillac Optiq may confuse some American buyers. This crossover is fully electric, so the alphanumeric nomenclature can't refer to engine displacement—and not horsepower, either. Instead, 500E4 refers to 500 Newton-meters of torque, the metric units for more familiar pound-feet, plus dual-motor all-wheel drive. Rating the Optiq's output in kilowatts might have at least rendered something at least somewhat more comprehensible, but the designation hints at the Optiq's intended global market, which in turn reveals just how important this crossover EV is for Cadillac's future.</p>\n<p>The Equinox slots in as an upmarket variant of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-chevrolet-equinox-ev-shows-gm-can-make-a-car-for-the-masses/\">the Chevrolet Equinox EV</a>, featuring a suite of enhancements unveiled at a Downtown Los Angeles preview last spring. With the exterior design, interior materials, and tech features all known quantities, I arrived to a drive program held in the San Francisco Bay Area—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/the-2025-cadillac-escalade-iq-first-drive-460-miles-on-a-single-charge.1506244/\">concurrently with the Escalade IQ</a>—more curious to experience how much the Optiq's additional power and refinement can possibly improve on the already solid Equinox.</p>\n<p>On paper, the Caddy bests its Chevy counterpart despite using much of the same hardware. In this case, an 85-kilowatt-hour battery allows for an EPA-estimated range of 302 miles (486 km) despite output from dual motors matching the AWD Equinox at 300 hp (223 kW), just with a bit more in the torque department at 354 lb-ft (almost, but not quite, that 500Nm figure).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-cadillac-optiq-sensibly-sized-and-improves-on-the-equinox-ev/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-cadillac-optiq-sensibly-sized-and-improves-on-the-equinox-ev/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Michael Teo Van Runkle","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66e69b280315c66b66b8a2562dacde5ec22a4aa4a6cd9e6cf1e6de578fbcd5c6","category":"Tech"}
