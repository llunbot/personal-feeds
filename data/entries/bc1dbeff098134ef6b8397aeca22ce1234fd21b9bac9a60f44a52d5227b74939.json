Whether we're talking about the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/05/macbook/\">white plastic MacBook from 2006</a>, the 11-inch MacBook Air from a decade ago, or the modern M1 MacBook Air, the list price for Apple's cheapest MacBook is usually within $100 or so of that four-digit price barrier (not counting refurbished Macs or ones that go on sale).</p>\n<p>Apple has a stated aversion to releasing less-expensive hardware just to hit an attractive price—\"cheap is for other people because we try to build a better product,\" Apple marketing SVP Greg Joswiak <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/we-are-giddy-interviewing-apple-about-its-mac-silicon-revolution/\">told us a few years ago</a>. But rumors of a low-cost MacBook pop up every few years, undeterred, usually conflating \"entry-level\" with \"low-cost.\" Here's a prediction about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2008/10/09/a-umor-and-a-poll-800-apple-laptop-imminent/\">an $800 MacBook</a> from October 2008 (actual entry-level prices: <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/10/14New-MacBook-Family-Redefines-Notebook-Design/\">$999 and $1,299</a>). Here's <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/03/03/more-affordable-13-inch-macbook-air/\">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-20/apple-is-said-to-plan-revamped-low-cost-macs-to-reignite-sales\">Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a> in 2018 predicting a MacBook Air \"with a lower price tag\" that would \"reignite sales\" (actual price: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/apple-finally-updates-macbook-air-with-retina-display/\">$1,199</a>, $200 more than the previous MacBook Air).</p>\n<p>This week, Kuo came back with an updated version of that same report, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1716885306933411885?s=20\">claiming</a> that Apple \"may also consider (but hasn't decided yet) introducing a more affordable MacBook model to boost shipments.\" Mac revenue and unit shipments have indeed been <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/charts-apple-q3-2023-results/\">down year-over-year for a few quarters</a>, though that has more to do with a pandemic- and Apple Silicon-fueled sales spike in 2021 and 2022 than anything (the revenue numbers are still on the high side of normal compared to 2019 and most of 2020).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978607#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978607&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc1dbeff098134ef6b8397aeca22ce1234fd21b9bac9a60f44a52d5227b74939","category":"Tech"}
