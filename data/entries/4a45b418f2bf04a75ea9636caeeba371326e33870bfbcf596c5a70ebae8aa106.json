No operating systems for other devices (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS) appear to have been updated at the same time, so whatever was wrong seems to be specific to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2231451/apple-vision-pro-review.html\">Apple Vision Pro</a>. The visionOS 1.2 developer beta got an update today as well, likely to include the same unspecificed bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>Apple’s release notes follow the boilerplate “unspecified bug fix” template:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update provides important bug fixes and is recommended for all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/HT201222&amp;xcust=1-1-2291635-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://support.apple.com/HT201222</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The security releases page has simply says “This update has no published CVE entries” for this release. That could mean there are security updates to issues that have not been reported, or it could mean that this release only fixes bugs. There is no link to see more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we find out more about what this particular visionOS release does, we’ll update this article. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4a45b418f2bf04a75ea9636caeeba371326e33870bfbcf596c5a70ebae8aa106","category":"Apple"}
