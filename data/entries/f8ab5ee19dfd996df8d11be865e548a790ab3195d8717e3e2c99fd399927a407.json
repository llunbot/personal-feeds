I have to decide what I can comfortably add to a living room already packed with PC and console hardware. For too long, that has meant saying \"no\" to good surround sound.</p>\n<p>But surround-friendly soundbars now make good sound possible in a smaller package, without needing to run wires through walls or drop some speakers in the ceiling. Some systems claim to do it all, complete with creative speaker placement and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/sonos-beam-gen-2-dolby-atmos-announced/\">virtualized surround-sound tricks</a>. Others use wireless pieces, including subwoofers and satellite speakers. In a particularly recent development, some soundbars even offer compatibility with the \"spatial surround\" standards of Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. The latter development, especially on game consoles, has jumpstarted my interest in finding a powerful system that balances performance needs and space demands.</p>\n<p>We don't review a lot of home audio at Ars, but a recent test opportunity with <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G0FU1U\" target=\"_blank\">the $1,900 Klipsch Cinema 1200</a> let me try one of the new higher-end \"spatial surround\" soundbars.
