And you probably shouldn’t trust it with your <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-chatbots-can-guess-your-personal-information/\">personal information</a> either. That’s especially true for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/spike-jonze-her-10-year-anniversary-artificial-intelligence/\">“AI girlfriends” or “AI boyfriends,”</a> according to new research.</p>\n<p>An analysis into 11 so-called romance and companion chatbots, published <a href=\"https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/happy-valentines-day-romantic-ai-chatbots-dont-have-your-privacy-at-heart/\">on Wednesday by the Mozilla Foundation</a>, has found a litany of security and privacy concerns with the bots. Collectively, the apps, which have been downloaded more than 100 million times on Android devices, gather huge amounts of people’s data; use trackers that send information to Google, Facebook, and companies in Russia and China; allow users to use weak passwords; and lack transparency about their ownership and the AI models that power them.</p>\n<p>Since OpenAI unleashed <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a> on the world in November 2022, developers have raced to deploy large language models and create chatbots that people can interact with and pay to subscribe to. The Mozilla research provides a glimpse into how this gold rush may have neglected people’s privacy, and into tensions between emerging technologies and how they gather and use data. It also indicates how people’s chat messages could be abused by hackers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003535#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003535&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2bce986cac5681f1e414f42f271b65fe431a412952d8c0aad40ac2f8e6ad70c6","category":"Tech"}
