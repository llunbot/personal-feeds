The SILCA Elettrico MICRO packs the power of 4+ CO2 cartridges in a package about the size of an AirPods case. When you turn it on, be ready as drone motors engage within the aluminum box. With auto-cutoff at 72 psi (no gauge), it’s safe for use with hookless rims. A single 25-minute charge provides enough power to last for months, ensuring it always has your back. The Elettrico Micro is our on-bike inflation solution.</p>\n<p>While the Elettrico ULTIMATE is ideal for destination gravel events or even as a floor pump replacement in your garage. Dialing in your tire pressure before a race or ride has never been easier with the 3-100 psi settable, auto cut off gauge. With certain tire and rim combination, we’ve had luck setting up tubeless tires, too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CO2 Performance Without the Waste – Eliminate disposable cartridges</li>\n<li>Auto Shutoff for Hookless Rims – Protects modern tubeless setups</li>\n<li>Air-Travel Safe – TSA-compliant for travel and destination rides and races.</li>\n<li>USB-C Rechargeable – Fast-charging for reliable inflation.</li>\n<li>Universal Chuck Compatibility – Works with SILCA Schradero &amp; Hiro Chucks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://alnk.to/7qmcpXE\" target=\"_blank\">Silca</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/silca-ellectrico-air-pump/\">Silca’s Drone Powered Ellectrico Air Pump Comes in Two Sizes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d6e32ddec0c2364823cbb5b512745bf86848ce9197741a071f870a5dc17a6a0e","category":"Cycling"}
