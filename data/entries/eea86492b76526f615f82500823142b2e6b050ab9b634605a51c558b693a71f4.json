{"title":"MacOS 15.2 Breaks the Ability to Create Bootable Startup Drive Backups","link":"https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/youre_a_mean_one/","date":1734537600000,"content":"\n<p>Dave Nanian, writing on the Shirt Pocket blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>macOS 15.2 was released a few days ago, with a surprise. A\nterrible, awful surprise. Apple broke the replicator. Towards\nthe end of replicating the Data volume, seemingly when it’s\nabout to copy either Preboot or Recovery, it fails with a\n<em>Resource Busy</em> error.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, <em>Resource Busy</em> could be worked around by ensuring\nthe system was kept awake. But this new bug means, on most\nsystems, there’s no fix. It just fails.</p>\n\n<p>Since Apple took away the ability for 3rd parties (eg, us) to copy\nthe OS, and took on the responsibility themselves, it’s been up to\nthem to ensure this functionality continues to work. And in that,\nthey’ve failed in macOS 15.2. Because this is their code, and\nwe’re forced to rely on it to copy the OS, OS copying will not\nwork until they fix it. [...]</p>\n\n<p>For those who may be working for Apple, or have good contacts, the\nbug is FB16090831. A fix would be really helpful, folks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means Shirt Pocket’s outstanding utility SuperDuper can’t make a bootable clone of your startup drive on a machine running MacOS 15.2.0. It’s worth noting that you can still use SuperDuper (or other backup utilities) to clone all of <em>your</em> data, which is, by far, the most essential data in any backup. But bootable startup-drive clones are an essential part of many people’s data integrity workflows.</p>\n\n<p>This bug <a href=\"https://writing.exchange/@davepolaschek/113674126798337422\">seems to affect</a> <a href=\"https://support.bombich.com/hc/en-us/categories/4411543022103\">CarbonCopyCloner</a> and Apple’s own Time Machine, too. A bug like this is always unfortunate, but especially around the holidays, when it might take longer than usual to get fixed, even if the issue is escalated within Apple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://talk.tidbits.com/t/macos-15-2-sequoia-breaks-bootable-backups-in-superduper/29742/3?u=ace\">This discussion thread at TidBITS-Talk</a> seems to make clear that whatever might be wrong with Time Machine on 15.2 isn’t the same bug that’s preventing SuperDuper from making bootable clones.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/macos-15-2-bootable-backup-bug\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"eea86492b76526f615f82500823142b2e6b050ab9b634605a51c558b693a71f4","category":"Tech"}
