We also took a close look at some of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/lidl-trek-tour-de-france-femme-bikes/\">Trek-Lidl’s amazing custom paintjobs</a>, with more pro bike checks to come.</p>\n<p>Back on the men’s race, we examined how bikes have changed since Chris Froome’s victory in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/2013-pinarello-dogma-vs-2023-cervelo-r5-s5/\">comparing his Pinarello Dogma to Jonas Vingegaard’s Cervélo S5</a> – oh how times change…</p>\n<p>We also heard Oscar Huckle’s thoughts on why Microshift Sword – a new affordable 10-speed gravel bike groupset – <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/microshift-sword-groupset-analysis/\">could upset the mid-range bike market</a>.</p>\n<p>In a slightly less balanced analysis, Tom Marvin launched into <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/gravel-bike-tech-opinions/\">an entertaining polemic against the state of gravel bike tech today</a> from the perspective of a dyed-in-the-wool mountain biker. The accompanying podcast is also a fun listen – I promise you’ll enjoy ol’ Marv turning red over topics as trivial as gravel suspension and electronic drivetrains.</p>\n<p>That’s only a small slither of the titillating tech tidings published on BikeRadar this week.

I truly hope so.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While I have never committed this opinion to words, I believe all external cam quick-release (QR) skewers are rubbish.</p>\n<p>They are typically lighter and cheaper than Campagnolo/Shimano-style internal cam skewers, but they’re also universally fiddly and feel horrible unless spotlessly clean and well-greased.</p>\n<p>Even then, their clamping power is puny compared to internal cam skewers and, urgh – they just suck.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lightweight external cam skewer\" title=\"Lightweight external cam skewer\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I will not be sorry to see the back of these stupid skewers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Well, I am here to admit that when building <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/jack-luke-road-bike-lee-cooper/\">my noodly road bike</a>, I strayed from the light and used a pair of daft super-light titanium/carbon external cam QRs. They were chosen because they were free and, more importantly, matching.</p>\n<p>To cut a (very!) long story short, my ears paid dearly for my sins.</p>\n<p>After months of trying to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/silence-those-persistent-mystery-creaks/\">track down a mystery creak</a> – which included a whole ride convinced the frame had cracked – I finally realised it was coming from the rear QR.</p>\n<p>When pedalling hard, the titanium shaft would flex. The cammed head of the lever would then move and creak inside the cup of the QR. Infuriating.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss RWS skewer\" title=\"DT Swiss RWS skewer\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I appreciate the ‘honkability’ of this solid lever – that is to say its ability to withstand a serious tightening.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Swapping to a bog standard Shimano QR from my parts bin immediately solved the problem. This also significantly reduced <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/lab-test-what-causes-brake-rub-the-wheels-or-the-frame/\">brake rub</a> from the bike’s rear end – an unexpected bonus.</p>\n<p>Unable to ride the bike with mismatched skewers (I’m not an animal), I have decided to replace both with a pair of DT Swiss’ RWS QRs.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss RWS skewer\" title=\"DT Swiss RWS skewer\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This matching combo soothes me.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These QRs work more like a typical <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-axle-standards/\">thru-axle</a>, with an adjustable handle that really enables you to crank things down. Because my road bike had old-school semi-sloping dropouts, I hope this will prevent the wheel from ever slipping forward.</p>\n<p>They also match the bike’s DT Swiss hubs, which soothes my weary, creaky mind.</p>\n<ul><li>£29.99 each, international pricing TBC</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<h2>Carradice Odyssey XL saddle bag</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Carradice Odyssey XL saddlebag\" title=\"Carradice Odyssey XL saddlebag\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Odyssey is Carradice’s largest saddle bag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Odyssey XL is Carradice’s largest saddle bag, with a capacity of 21 litres.</p>\n<p>This can be expanded to 26 litres by unclipping the folding expander lid. Two large pockets sit on either side of the bag for easy access.</p>\n<p>D-rings sewn into the straps enable you to fasten additional luggage – or, if you’re feeling old-school, a rain cape – to the top of the bag.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Carradice Odyssey XL saddlebag\" title=\"First Look Friday July 2023 (3 of 12)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bag is made from tough Cordura.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Unlike Carradice’s traditional bags, which are manufactured from waxed cotton duck (a heavy tightly woven canvas), the Odyssey XL is manufactured using synthetic 1,000 denier Cordura.</p>\n<p>The bag can be mounted in the traditional manner direct to saddle loops but, speaking from experience, I recommend pairing this with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/bike-racks/carradice-bagman-qr-expedition-rack-review/\">Carradice Bagman support</a> if you plan on riding off-road or carrying a heavy load.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Carradice Odyssey XL saddlebag\" title=\"Carradice Odyssey XL saddlebag\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The roll-top closer can be left open to expand the storage capacity of the bag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Bagman is a small rack that clamps onto your saddle rails. It can be paired with additional struts to provide support and stability for heavier loads.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the base of the bag can be draped over a rear <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-pannier-bags/\">pannier rack</a>, provided your saddle is not too high from the top of the rack.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Carradice Odyssey XL saddlebag\" title=\"Carradice Odyssey XL saddlebag\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This plastic stiffener should prevent saggy bag syndrome – a common curse of the Carradice owner.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Unless packed well, traditional Carradice bags typically sag when mounted to a Bagman support or pannier rack. A corrugated plastic stiffener that slides into a pocket in the base of the Odyssey XL should prevent this.</p>\n<p>The Odyssey XL is available in black, camo or high-vis yellow.</p>\n<ul><li>£100, international shipping available</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Ergon SMC Core Men saddle</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ergon SMC Core Men saddle (1 of 6)\" title=\"Ergon SMC Core Men saddle (1 of 6)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like my ever-faithful stoker, the Ergon SMC Core Men saddle has proven to be a very reliable cycle touring companion.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Ergon SMC Core Men saddle is designed specifically for an upright riding position, with a layer of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) foam (Core 3D, in Ergon parlance) sitting between the upper and base of the saddle, providing heaps of squishy support.</p>\n<p>I fitted this saddle to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bikeradar-builds-jacks-refurbished-touring-tandem-cecil/\">my (our?) tandem</a> ahead of a two-week tour earlier in the summer.

Seated pedalling on rough terrain is far more comfortable than with my old saddle (which wasn’t really designed for this type of riding), with reduced saddle soreness to boot.</p>\n<p>I suspect a lot of this is thanks to the saddle’s ability to pivot and wiggle while pedalling.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ergon SMC Core Men saddle (1 of 6)\" title=\"Ergon SMC Core Men saddle (1 of 6)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wide wings provide ample support when riding in an upright position.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>My partner – who spends a lot of time looking at my perky peach when we’re on the tandem – can confirm the upper ‘shell’ of the saddle noticeably moves around on top of the TPU Core 3D layer while pedalling.</p>\n<p>In addition to touring and commuting saddles, Ergon also produces gravel bike saddles equipped with Core 3D technology.</p>\n<ul><li>£144.99/€159.95</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>Vittoria Air-Liner Light tyre insert</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittoria Air Liner XC tyre insert\" title=\"Vittoria Air Liner XC tyre insert\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vittoria Air-Liner Light is one of the lightest tyre inserts on the market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>From one squishy foam to another, we now turn to the Vittoria Air-Liner Light – a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-tyre-inserts/\">tyre insert</a> designed specifically for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The Vittoria Air-Liner Light weighs 50g per insert. That’s significantly lighter than its closest competitor, the CushCore XC, which weighs a claimed 150g per insert. The Tubolight EVO SL is closer at 58g (claimed weight).</p>\n<p>In addition to offering rim and tyre protection, Vittoria claims the permeable foam will expand in the event of a puncture.</p>\n<p>Vittoria says this enables the tyre to be run when flat, at the very least enabling racers to get back to the pits for a tyre swap.
