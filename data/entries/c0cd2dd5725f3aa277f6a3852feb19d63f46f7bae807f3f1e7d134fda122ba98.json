The work, he complained on social media, was aimed at helping “throat cancer patients recover from radiation therapy faster.” And yet, he noted on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dlipomi.bsky.social/post/3li3thme3qc22\">Bluesky</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darren-lipomi-5926187_cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-activity-7295812417756835840-HLDF?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJYWNkBP6AxLEpYMfMrbJfVwtOdENA1LE8\">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/darren_lipomi/status/1890179491554816498\">X</a>, his project was among nearly 3,500 National Science Foundation grants <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-in-woke-dei-grants-at-nsf-releases-full-database\">recently described</a> by the likes of Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican and chair of the powerful Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, as “woke DEI” research.

Trump’s second administration. Lipomi, for his part, described the situation as absurd.
