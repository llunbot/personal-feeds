Outside that area, drivers would have received minimum compensation of $1.25 per mile and 34 cents per minute. It also guaranteed a minimum fee of $5 for any transportation provided.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942561#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942561&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5d3a102802cc9137d8cdf1ce1d5c711daef4f8110b5b55a88c7fbfee59282d9","category":"Tech"}
