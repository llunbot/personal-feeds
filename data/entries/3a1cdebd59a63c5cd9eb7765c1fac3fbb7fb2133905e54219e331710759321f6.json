The move comes after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/what-the-physics-of-crowds-can-tell-us-about-the-tragic-deaths-at-astroworld/\">the tragic events at Houston's Astroworld concert last Friday</a>, where at least eight people died and 25 were hospitalized during Scott's performance.</p>\n<p>Fortnite confirmed that the move was \"intentional\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1457538163262607361\">in a Twitter update Sunday night</a>Â but made no mention of Scott or the specific motivation for the decision. An Epic representative was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>The emote in question <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjNb3pvzyZo\">plays a clip from the song \"Out West\"</a> by Scott and Jackboys alongside <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/out-west-challenge-tiktok/\">a dance based on a viral TikTok sensation</a> set to the same song. It first appeared in the game in August 2020 and has been regularly available for 500 V-Bucks (roughly $3 to $4) <a href=\"https://progameguides.com/fortnite-cosmetic/out-west/\">at least once a month</a> ever since. Players who have previously purchased the emote can still use it in the game, alongside <a href=\"https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Travis_Scott\">a Travis Scott skin</a> that was available for purchase in April 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811496#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811496&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3a1cdebd59a63c5cd9eb7765c1fac3fbb7fb2133905e54219e331710759321f6","category":"Tech"}
