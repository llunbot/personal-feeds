The tightly woven microfibre outer layer provides protection from the wind and rain.</p>\n<p>Condensation caused by sweat and body heat builds up on the outer face of the pump liner, where it can then transfer to the shell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTKV_4smGS8\" target=\"_blank\">Páramo’s own explainer video</a> explains this concept very well.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – riding in the rain\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – riding in the rain\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Even when worn with just a baselayer, the jacket remains comfortable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Reuben Bakker-Dyos / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Speaking from extensive experience, these claims ring true – provided you look after them (more on this later), Páramo jackets provided unparalleled comfort in wet weather.</p>\n<p>Even when worn with just a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-base-layers/\">baselayer</a> – which I have done on several occasions – the soft liner layer never feels clammy.</p>\n<p>As a perpetually damp man who runs too hot even in the depths of winter, that’s impressive.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h2>BikeRadar’s High-Mileage Heroes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/high-mileage-heroes/\">High-Mileage Heroes</a> showcases the products that have stood the test of time and become part of our everyday riding.</p>\n<p>These aren’t reviews, but rather a chance to talk about the kit we depend on and the products we choose to use when we’re not reviewing fresh gear.</p>\n<p>More from High-Mileage Heroes:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/halo-tk-hubs/\">Jack’s Halo TK fixed gear hubs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/speedplay-zero-pedals/\">Matthew’s Speedplay Zero pedals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-me7-shoes/\">Tom’s Shimano ME7 shoes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bont-vaypor-classic-shoes/\">Simon’s Bont Vaypor Classic shoes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/alexs-ancient-and-favourite-tools/\">Alex’s ancient and most favourite tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stans-chrome-industries-mini-metro-bag/\">Stan’s Chrome Industries Mini Metro bag</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/high-mileage-heroes-oscars-castelli-gabba-2-jacket/\">Oscar’s Castelli Gabba 2 jacket</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/high-mileage-heroes-matts-garmin-forerunner-45/\">Matt’s Garmin Forerunner 45 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/high-mileage-hero-elite-direto-xr-smart-trainer/\">Simon’s Elite Direto XR smart trainer </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/high-mileage-heroes-oscars-favourite-workshop-tools/\">Oscar’s favourite workshop tools</a></li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>A versatile and well-considered design</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – Jack sat in bus stop\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – Jack sat in bus stop\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The jacket is perfect for cycle touring (or hiding from the rain in a bus shelter).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Velez Adventure Light smock is one of Páramo’s lightest waterproof jackets. It’s not cycling-specific, with a baggy cut and no dropped tail. However, for less strenuous cycling where aerodynamics are not a consideration, it’s an ideal choice.</p>\n<p>The Velez smock is also available with a harder-wearing outer shell (the Páramo Velez Adventure smock) or as a standard jacket (the Páramo Velez) for greater protection from the elements.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – chest pocket\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – chest pocket\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I love a chest pocket.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I prefer a pullover jacket because I find the large kangaroo pouch chest pocket very useful.</p>\n<p>While an unlikely scenario, unlike a full-length zip, the smock would still provide useful weather protection if the ¼ zip happened to fail.</p>\n<p>The capacious hood easily accommodates a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-helmets/\">road bike helmet</a>. Easy-to-grab elastic adjusters on the nape of the neck and around the aperture of the hood can be used to cinch it in place.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – pit zips\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – pit zips\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Large vents make for a breezy jacket in clammy conditions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>However, zipping the ¼ chest zip right the way up is enough to hold the hood up while riding.</p>\n<p>Large pit-to-hem zips provide ample ventilation for strenuous efforts and I can shut out the elements with Velcro tabs on the cuffs.</p>\n<p>The quality of Páramo’s fasteners should not be overlooked. In six years of use, none of the poppers have fallen off, the zippers still zip merrily and the Velcro patches on the cuffs continue to grip tenaciously.</p>\n<h2>Repairable without compromise</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – closeup of pump liner\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – closeup of pump liner\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The two-layer construction of the jacket means it’s possible to repair the jacket without compromising waterproofing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Despite heavy use, the outer shell of the jacket remains tear-free. This has surprised me because the outer feels flimsy compared to a laminated shell.</p>\n<p>Should I ever take a tumble and tear the jacket, the outer can be repaired with a needle and thread without compromising the jacket’s waterproofing.</p>\n<p>Laminated jackets must be repaired with glue-on patches or specialist tape. Speaking from experience, this can be a messy process, and one that is hard to do well.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/why-repairing-bikes-is-important/\">someone who values user repairability</a> and likes a night on the ol’ Singer, this is a huge boon.</p>\n<h2>Bulky, but worth it</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – size comparison\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – size comparison\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Velez Adventure Light (top left) is considerably bulkier than a Rapha Explore Hooded Gore-Tex Pullover (top right), and enormous compared to a Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex ShakeDry jacket (bottom).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Though the jacket is light in the context of hardcore mountaineering jackets, it’s portly compared to a typical cycling jacket.</p>\n<p>It weighs 680g for my size-medium jacket. For comparison, the Rapha Explore Pullover pictured above weighs 250g in the same size.</p>\n<p>Weight aside, the jacket’s real downside is its bulk. Though it will (just) pack down into its kangaroo pocket, the jacket is still quite chunky.</p>\n<p>This rules it out unless you ride without a sizeable bar or saddle bag.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – dirt and wear\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock – dirt and wear\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The jacket looks a bit minging after years of hard wear (and yes, I have washed it!).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The cuffs and other high-wear areas also get grubby from bodily oils and general wear quicker than a jacket with a hardy durable water-repellent (DWR) layer.</p>\n<p>The Velez Light is also about as aerodynamic as a wheelie bin and puffs up like a nylon tangerine in a headwind – not one for go-fast road riding, then.</p>\n<p>I generally turn to my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jackets-and-vests/rapha-pro-team-lightweight-gore-tex-shakedry-jacket-review/\">Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex ShakeDry jacket</a> for road riding in the rain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack Luke fixing bike in Rapha ShakeDry jacket\" title=\"Jack Luke fixing bike in Rapha ShakeDry jacket\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> ShakeDry jackets are impressive, but hard-wearing kit they are not.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joe Norledge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For packability and weight, you cannot beat the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gore-tex-shakedry-cycling-rain-jackets/\">best ShakeDry jackets</a>.

I recommend you buy in bulk because it works out a lot cheaper in the long run.</p>\n<p>Páramo also offers a professional cleaning and reproofing service. My jacket looks pretty rank after years of wear, so I may consider this soon.</p>\n<h2>Dad-approved tech</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – hill walking\" title=\"Páramo Velez Adventure Light smock high mileage hero Jack Luke BikeRadar – hill walking\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Father and son – a pair of Páramo proselytes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Laura Dow</i></span></div>\n<p>As a final point, my dad is a seasoned mountaineer who spends a lot of time tramping around the dreich Scottish Highlands.</p>\n<p>He’s also fussy and, in common with many men of his age, sometimes sceptical of new tech.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, he’s cast aside the clammy embrace of laminated waterproofs and made a wholesale move to Páramo kit, including the brand’s trousers.</p>\n<p>He lauds the unparalleled breathability of the jackets and the dry feel when worn against bare skin.</p>\n<p>He also uses Páramo kit when cycling, generally on his way up a glen to doss in his tent.
