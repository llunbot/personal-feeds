{"title":"Apple Events 2024: Apple’s event calendar","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html","date":1698761388000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t often participate in big industry-wide events such as CES or E3. The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Apple Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these ‘events,’ and streams them live online to millions of watchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, there were three such events: A spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. An additional event was expected in October or November but never materialized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far in 2023, we’ve had three events: WWDC in June, the Wonderlust iPhone event in September and Apple’s second fall event on October 30. We don’t expect there to be another Apple event in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out what events and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new Apple product launches</a> the company has in store for 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s next event? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s next event probably won’t happen until the spring of 2024. The company has already said it will launch the Apple Vision Pro headset “early next year in the U.S.” which does seem to point to a launch at a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-2023-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring Apple event</a>. Apple could be ready to launch a number of other products by that time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spring event in 2023 seems plausible, but Apple doesn’t always hold a spring event. There were no Apple spring events in 2023 or 2020, but when they do happen, they can be significant. In spring 2022, Apple announced the iPhone SE 2, iPad Air, and Mac Studio and Studio Display; in 2021, we got the iMac, AirTag, and Apple TV 4K. And in 2019, the event was devoted to Apple’s services: Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is, the event will most likely take place on a Monday or Tuesday in mid-March, but it’s hard to pinpoint a likely date given the variety of dates this event has been held on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s when Apple has held its past few spring events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2023: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Tuesday, March 8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday, April 20</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: No event due to Covid (iPhone SE launched on April 24)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Monday, March 25</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, March 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Monday, March 21</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: Monday, March 9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Wednesday, March 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2011: Wednesday, March 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2010: Thursday, April 8</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the next Apple event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the event starts at 10 am PT that translates to the following times in the countries where most of our readers live.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST), 8 pm (EET/EEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: at 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Next day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: Next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the October 30 event took place much later at 5pm PT. That translates to the following times. We hope that Apple doesn’t hold its next event at this time, but it is possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: 5 p.m. (PDT), 6 pm (MDT), 7 pm (CDT), 8 pm (EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: Next day at 12 am (GMT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: Next day at 1 am (CET), 2 am EET</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: 5 pm (PDT), 6 pm (MDT), 7 pm (CDT), 8 pm (EDT), 9 pm (ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: Next day at 5.30 am </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Singapore and China: Next day at 8 am</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Next day at  8 am (AWST), 10.30 am (ACDT), 11 am (AEDT), 10 am (AEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: Next day at 1 pm (NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does an Apple event last?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives. WWDC and the September event tend to be longer keynotes; the spring and late-fall events can be slightly shorter. The October 30 event in 2023 lasted about half an hour. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple usually hold events?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple holds three or four live or live-streamed events throughout the year where the company unveils its latest products and plans during a keynote address. They are usually held during similar times of the year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>March/April: Spring event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>June: WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>September: Fall event (aka iPhone launch event)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October/November: Late-fall event(s)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This event calendar is by no means set in stone, though, with the spring and October events being less regular. Some years, Apple doesn’t hold a spring event at all, as was the case in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer and September events are more predictable, with software coming at WWDC in June and iPhones and Apple Watches in September. The October event often sees Apple launch new Macs, but this is another one that changes from year to year.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" width=\"1069\" height=\"743\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" /><figcaption>Apple launched the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro in September 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple events will take place in 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the events we expect to see in 2024, and what could launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spring event 2024 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed above, we expect an Apple event in March or April. Probably mid-March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know that Apple’s Vision Pro headset is set to launch in “early 2024” so a spring launch for that is entirely feasible. What else could we see? If we don’t see one before the end of 2023 a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/new-ipad-air-all-the-rumors-about-apples-6th-gen-ipad-air.html\">iPad Air</a> could be likely. We could also see the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.htm\">M3 Mac mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">AirPods</a> could at least gain USB-C, but there may be bigger changes coming. We could even see Apple launch a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC: June 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC usually takes place in the first or second week of June. In 2023 the opening keynote was held on Monday, June 5. Apple announced three new Macs and the Vision Pro headset as well as revealing the new features coming to the various operating systems in updates later in the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote on the Monday, developer events and sessions will run throughout the week. You can read more about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC date, times and everything you need to know</a> in a separate article.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WWDC 2023: June 5-9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2022: June 6-10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2021: June 7-11</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2020: June 22-26</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2019: June 3-7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2018: June 4-8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2017: June 5-9</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple uses WWDC each year to unveil the latest versions of its operating systems, so in 2024 we’ll get a preview of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, and tvOS 18, and possibly an update to Apple’s realityOS. New hardware sometimes makes an appearance at WWDC as well, so we may see the M3 Ultra Mac Pro and Mac Studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 16 launch event: September 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple always holds an event in September, and almost always uses this to announce a new iPhone and Apple Watch. (The only exception in recent memory was in 2020, as a result of Covid-related production issues. That year the iPhone was announced in October.) Here are the past few Apple September event dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2023: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Tuesday, September 13</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Wednesday, September 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday, September 14</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, September 15</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Tuesday, September 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Wednesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>October 2024 Event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be iPad and Mac events in October and/or November 2024. But this is a long way off so we won’t get into too much detail just yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Apple has held a second fall event on the following dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2023: Monday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 13 and Tuesday, November 10 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Thursday, October 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: Thursday, October 16</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: Tuesday, October 22</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Tuesday, October 23</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2011: Tuesday, October 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect Apple to launch new iPads and Macs. </p>\n\nApple Inc, iPad, iPhone, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0e568224f77d53cf3fe8e26058901a12be5447b83e2f23356dac9205afa8d72b","category":"Apple"}
