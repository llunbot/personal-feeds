The chemicals that were previously relied upon to create waterproof clothing, PFAS – perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances – are being ushered out due to their negative impact on the environment. That means manufacturers have been scrambling to find technology that can be water-resistant without damaging the world around us. Cue Polartec’s Power Shield Family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Power Shield Family features two innovative fabrics: Power Shield Pro and Power Shield RPM. Power Shield Pro’s membrane is crafted from plant-based materials, while Power Shield RPM’s membrane is made from 100% recycled polyester fibre content. What they do have in common, is that both are responsibly made, with their own story to tell. Whether that’s helping to reduce the impact on the planet by lowering the carbon footprint, or enabling circular processes with recycled polyester membranes. These fabrics are pushing the boundaries of waterproofing, windproofing, breathability, durability and comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polartec’s new Power Shield fabrics are now available to buy, and will help keep riders happy on the bike, no matter what the coming weather has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Shield Pro</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"968\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-968x970.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-968x970.png 968w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-300x300.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-150x150.png 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-768x770.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-75x75.png 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-350x350.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-750x752.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1-1140x1143.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/sportful-polartec-1.png 1343w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Polartec Power Shield Pro is an award-winning breathable shell fabric for jackets.

That means it can withstand the pressure of a 20,000mm column of water, while allowing 20,000g of water to <em>leave </em>a square metre section over 24 hours. In short, it’s hard to beat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, it’s produced to be able to withstand wear and tear, so will cope handily with what your ride may have in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Shield RPM</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-970x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Castelli-Ultra-Rain-Cape-1140x1140.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Polartec Power Shield RPM has a bigger emphasis on stretch, for high-intensity activity.

Three high-profile cycling brands in particular are using the new Power Shield materials for their new kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, Castelli’s brand new Ultra Rain Cape is a waterproof packable jacket that uses Power Shield RPM, it provides proper rain protection while squashing down to less than the size of a jersey pocket. It fits nicely over a jersey without flapping but also fits over a bigger jacket for when it’s that bit colder.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.castelli-cycling.com/GB/en/Men/Cycling/Top/Protection/Waterproof/ULTRA-RAIN-CAPE/p/4524506_383_82_3XL\" target=\"_blank\">Castelli Ultra Rain Cape</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sportful’s new Fiandre Pro 2 jacket uses Power Shield Pro for best-in-class rain and wind protection on a winter jacket.
