During its annual hardware event Wednesday, Amazon demoed the generative-AI-powered Alexa that users can soon preview on Echo devices. But in all its talk of new features and a generative-AI-fueled future, Amazon barely acknowledged the longstanding elephant in the room: privacy.</p>\n<p>Amazon's devices event featured a new Echo Show 8, updated Ring devices, and new Fire TV sticks.
