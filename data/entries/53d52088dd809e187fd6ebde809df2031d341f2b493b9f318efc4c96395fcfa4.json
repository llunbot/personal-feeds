Such AI integration will be separated into categories of \"pre-generated\" content that is \"created with the help of AI tools during development\" (e.g., <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/\">using DALL-E for in-game images</a>) and \"live-generated\" content that is \"created with the help of AI tools while the game is running\" (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/24030322/nvidia-ace-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2024\">using Nvidia's AI-powered NPC technology</a>).</p>\n<p>Those disclosures will be shared on the Steam store pages for these games, which should help players who want to avoid certain types of AI content. But disclosure will not be sufficient for games that use live-generated AI for \"Adult Only Sexual Content,\" which Valve says it is \"unable to release... right now.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995005#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995005&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53d52088dd809e187fd6ebde809df2031d341f2b493b9f318efc4c96395fcfa4","category":"Tech"}
