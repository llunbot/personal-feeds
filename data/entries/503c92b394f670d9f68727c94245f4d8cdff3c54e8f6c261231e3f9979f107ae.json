The first variant features a thin circular design similar to Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ charger puck. Still, according to the report, Realme's will be even \"sleeker\" than Apple's and offer 15W charging speeds. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/realme-magdart-puck.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second model, featuring a more unorthodox design, is a larger charger with a built-in fan to help \"keep thermals in check during charging.\" Compared to the thinner \"MagDart\" charger, the more bulky model will offer charging speeds \"that will rival modern wired fast charging tech.\" Both the thin and larger \"MagDart\" chargers will function as expected by clipping onto the back of the \"Realme Flash.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/realme-magdart-charger.jpg\" /><div><em>Image Credit to: <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/exclusive_realme_flash_is_the_first_android_phone_with_magnetic_wireless_charging-news-50232.php\">GSMArena</a></em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nMany comparisons will be put forward between Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ technology and Realme's \"MagDart,\" but there's still much we don't know. Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ technology allows for a wide range of accessories, giving third-party companies the freedom to make several ‌MagSafe‌ additions for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, Apple sells not only ‌MagSafe‌ chargers but also cases, wallets, and more. It remains unclear whether Realme's \"MagDart\" is just one part of a larger ecosystem of magnetic accessories the Chinese maker plans to launch for the Android market.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/realme-launching-magdart-as-equivalent-magsafe/\">Realme Planning to Launch 'MagDart' Magnetic Charger As Android Equivalent to Apple's MagSafe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/realme-planning-to-launch-magdart-magnetic-charger-as-android-equivalent-to-apples-magsafe.2305617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I0WpYJmgD34:2sYt6QTNJEY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I0WpYJmgD34:2sYt6QTNJEY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/I0WpYJmgD34\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"503c92b394f670d9f68727c94245f4d8cdff3c54e8f6c261231e3f9979f107ae","category":"Apple"}
