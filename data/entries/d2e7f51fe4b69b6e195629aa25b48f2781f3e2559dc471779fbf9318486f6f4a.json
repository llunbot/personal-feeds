Monday’s report sheds a little more light on the design, which could bring a record-breaking change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797408311513600503&amp;xcust=1-1-2355006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Ice Universe on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will “become the world’s narrowest bezel mobile phone,” beating out the Galaxy S24’s 1.52mm bezels. The current iPhone 15 Pro models have bezels that are 1.55mm thick, so we’re not talking about a dramatic difference. However, as Ice Universe points out, the slimmer bezels will bring the iPhone 16 Pro “very close to the dream form [factor].”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>My friend confirmed that iPhone 16 Pro will  reduce bezel, surpassing Galaxy S24 to become the world's narrowest bezel mobile phone, which seems to be very close to the dream form.</p>— ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1797408311513600503?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2355006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">June 2, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors have been swirling for months that Apple is planning to increase the screen size of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max by two-tenths of an inch (6.3 and 6.9 inches), so the reduced bezels will help keep the handset size down. Plus, it’ll bring the iPhone ever closer to a true all-screen design with an unobstructed piece of glass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, if it’s something you care about–and Ice Universe definitely does, having tracked the bezel battle between Samsung and Apple for years–Apple will once again take the thinnest bezel crown from Samsung for at least a few months until the S25 makes its debut. Ice Universe was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1523932/iphone-15-ultra-renders-design-titanium-usb-c-camera-bump.html\">one of the first to report</a> Apple’s shrinking bezels for the iPhone 15 last year as well, so we can likely trust this rumor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 Pro in September with an upgraded camera, A18 Pro processor, and a new “Capture” button, along with the larger screens.
