The ultra-endurance bikepacking race is simple – stick to the 1800km track from Talas to Balykchy, an old fishing town on the northern edge of Lake Issyk-Kul, collecting brevet stamps at three control points along the way – all self-supported. There’ll be fast competition at the front, but there are no prizes at the finished, just bragging rights, even for anyone who finishes before the safety time cut off more than a week later.

It all starts somewhere. For two riders on the St. Augustine’s University Cycling Team, the first official cycling team at a historically Black college or university, it came on a beautiful day in Rock Hill, SC. There, at the Rock Hill Outdoor Center, site of national and UCI cycling events, SAU athletes Brandon Valentine-Parris and Finote Weldemariam would compete in their first sanctioned race. It was only a 50-minute, 20-lap race. But the moment felt bigger somehow. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtfi70OYuQTXKx3j-5LspO8E9t0xOY5-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chasing History</a>.</li></ul><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" data-ezsrc=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/582323024\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><ul><li><strong>Sea Otter gets gobbled up by Life Time</strong> – In their ever-expanding takeover of the most popular American cycling events, Life Time has acquired the Sea Otter Classic in Monterey, CA. Continuing their investment in on the bike experiences (after Leadville 100, Crusher in the Tushar &amp; Unbound/Kanza Gravel) Life Time seems committed to supporting the cycling community while grabbing a dominant foothold across racing disciplines. For now, little is expected to change, but maybe the added investment will boost all of these events collectively. <a href=\"https://www.seaotterclassic.com/life-time/\">SeaOtterClassic.com/Life-Time</a></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06171648/Greyp.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22600%22%20height%3D%22400%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-ezsrc=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06171648/Greyp.gif\"></a></p><ul><li><strong>Greyp iOS updates bring more e-bike functionality</strong> – The latest Greyp iOS app update makes their “<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/13/greyp-t5-trekking-e-bike-takes-smart-connectivity-out-on-tour-commutes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">always connected</a>” e-bike systems&nbsp;even better, with new &amp; upgraded re-routing &amp; turn-by-turn navigation, improved visibility in direct sunlight, more data statistics in Dashboard mode, and better overall app visibility.
