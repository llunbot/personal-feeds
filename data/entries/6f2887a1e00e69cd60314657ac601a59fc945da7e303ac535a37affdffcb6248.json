In the document, Apple revealed that iPhones will better support third-party displays and batteries later in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nFirst, Apple said True Tone will work with third-party iPhone displays later this year:<blockquote>True Tone requires precise calibration to function properly, and it is not possible to engage a default calibration for third-party displays, which can result in unexpected behavior. For this reason, Apple disables the True Tone feature when third-party displays are used, but enables all other aspects of the display. <strong>In an effort to offer more complete support for third-party parts, starting later in 2024, Apple will allow consumers to activate True Tone with third-party parts to the best performance that can be provided.</strong>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThey will be able to deactivate True Tone in Settings if the display does not perform to their satisfaction.</blockquote>True Tone automatically adapts the color of the display to match the light in your environment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond, Apple said battery health metrics such as maximum capacity and cycle count will work with third-party iPhone batteries later this year:<blockquote>Currently, battery health metrics such as maximum capacity and cycle count are not presented to consumers whose devices have third-party batteries. This is because the accuracy of these metrics cannot be verified by Apple. In fact, an Apple internal analysis has found that some third-party batteries sold as new are actually secondhand, with battery health metrics manipulated to appear as new. <strong>In an effort to improve support for third-party batteries, starting later in 2024, Apple will display battery health metrics with a notification stating that Apple cannot verify the information presented.</strong></blockquote>Apple said the third-party battery metrics are not guaranteed to be accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese changes will presumably be rolled out with iOS 18 updates later this year, but Apple did not provide more specific timing in its document.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/iphone-third-party-display-battery-support/\">Apple Says iPhones Will Better Support Third-Party Displays and Batteries Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphones-will-better-support-third-party-displays-and-batteries-later-this-year.2430156/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f2887a1e00e69cd60314657ac601a59fc945da7e303ac535a37affdffcb6248","category":"Apple"}
