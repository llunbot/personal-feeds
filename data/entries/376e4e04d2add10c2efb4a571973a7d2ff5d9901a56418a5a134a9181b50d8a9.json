The refurbished models will be available in Midnight or White for $249, compared to $299 brand new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-White-and-Midnight-Feature-Blue-Orange.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple says certified refurbished HomePods undergo full functionality testing, and are inspected, cleaned, and repackaged in a plain white box with the power cord and documentation. The refurbished HomePods are covered by Apple's limited one-year warranty policy and are eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/\">in January 2023</a>, the second-generation HomePod has a similar design as the full-size HomePod that was discontinued in 2021, but with a larger backlit touch surface and some internal changes, including two fewer tweeters and two fewer microphones compared to the original. The second-generation HomePod also features the S7 chip like the Apple Watch Series 7 for \"more advanced computational audio,\" a U1 chip for handing off audio from an iPhone, and an indoor temperature and humidity sensor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear exactly when the refurbished HomePods will be available, but orders will likely start to be accepted at any point in the next few weeks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanwgregg\">Ryan Gregg</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/refurbished-2023-homepod-coming-soon/\">2023 HomePod Coming Soon to Apple's Refurbished Store for $249</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2023-homepod-coming-soon-to-apples-refurbished-store-for-249.2389996/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"376e4e04d2add10c2efb4a571973a7d2ff5d9901a56418a5a134a9181b50d8a9","category":"Apple"}
