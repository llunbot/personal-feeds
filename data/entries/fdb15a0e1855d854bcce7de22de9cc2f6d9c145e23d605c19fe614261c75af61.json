This enables Android users to interact with iMessage features such as reactions, threads, high-quality media sharing, and group chats, without the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users noticing any difference.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app represents a departure from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/nothing-announces-imessage-compatibility/\">previous methods</a> of accessing iMessage on non-Apple devices, which typically involved relaying messages through a Mac hosted in the cloud or signing in with an ‌Apple ID‌. Beeper Mini's approach involves direct communication with Apple's servers by registering a user's phone number with iMessage, a process that apparently required extensive reverse engineering of Apple's messaging system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeeper is a startup led by Eric Migicovsky that aims to consolidate various messaging services into a single platform. Since its initial launch on desktop devices in 2021, Beeper raised $16 million in funding. Beeper claims that Beeper Mini does not access messages, contacts, or ‌Apple ID‌ passwords. The app's code will also be made open source, offering transparency and allowing for independent review.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeeper Mini is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima\">now available for download</a> on the Google Play Store, with a seven-day free trial followed by a subscription fee of $2 per month. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/\">iMessage</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/\">Beeper Mini Brings iMessage to Android With No Need for Apple ID Sign-In</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android-with-no-need-for-apple-id-sign-in.2412881/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fdb15a0e1855d854bcce7de22de9cc2f6d9c145e23d605c19fe614261c75af61","category":"Apple"}
