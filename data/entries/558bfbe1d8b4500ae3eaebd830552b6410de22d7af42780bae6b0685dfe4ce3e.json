{"title":"HCP Terraform adds public Terraform module and provider management via organizations","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hcp-terraform-adds-public-terraform-module-provider-management-via-organizations","date":1747162800000,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/\">Terraform Registry</a> serves as the central discovery and distribution hub for essential public Terraform providers and modules — sourced directly from HashiCorp, verified technology partners, and the broader community. With a combined total exceeding 5,000 providers and nearing 20,000 modules across these tiers, it's the go-to artifact manager enabling efficient IaC practices for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Before now, the ownership of public modules and providers in the Terraform registry was based on an individual’s GitHub account. This created some management difficulties. A module or provider page would still roll up to the namespace of the related GitHub organization. But when a maintainer needed to login to the Terraform registry to manage artifacts — for example, to resync or delete a version — that person had to use the account of the individual who first published the artifact. This becomes a problem when that individual departs the organization.</p>\n\n<p>In response, we’ve now added other options. Maintainers of public Terraform modules and providers can now claim ownership of their artifacts within an HCP Terraform <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations\">organization</a>, leveraging access permissions and team management benefits. This reduces artifact maintenance costs by reducing the troubleshooting timeline and getting new versions to the registry faster. It also eliminates risk by aligning artifact ownership with your organization and preventing registry access by maintainers that have departed your company.</p>\n\n<p>You can now do the following in the context of an HCP Terraform organization:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Grant or remove public registry management permissions for individuals (for tiers with teams)</li>\n<li>Connect to a new or existing public registry namespace (aligns with the GitHub org that contains your registry artifacts)</li>\n<li>Resync modules and providers</li>\n<li>Publish new modules and providers</li>\n<li>Delete module and provider versions</li>\n<li>Manage GPG keys for providers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Publishing new versions still functions as expected when a new version is released in the artifact repository.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1746040036-namespace-pub-module-provider-mgmt.png\" alt=\"Dashboard\" /><p>Managing public Terraform artifacts with HCP Terraform is free, including SSO. Artifact ownership remains with the organization. This new approach allows organizations to claim multiple namespaces and manage permissions, ensuring only authorized users can handle public registry content.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, organizations can control artifact access by managing separate HCP Terraform organizations or limiting maintainer invitations. This change provides flexibility for future Git platform usage and avoids excessive access to GitHub organizations.</p>\n\n<h2>Get started with HCP Terraform</h2>\n\n<p>We’re working to ensure HCP Terraform continues to deliver improvements that help customers have better visibility and control over their environment throughout their infrastructure lifecycle.
