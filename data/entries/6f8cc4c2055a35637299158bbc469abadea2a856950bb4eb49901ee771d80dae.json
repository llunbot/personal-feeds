{"title":"Sam Altman and Jony Ive Introduce ‘io’, the Device-Making Partnership Between OpenAI and LoveFrom","link":"https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/","date":1747847277000,"content":"\n<p>No details on <em>what</em> yet, but a lovely little 9-minute video on <em>why</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Sam Altman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“What it means to use technology can change in a profound way. I\nhope we can bring some of the delight, wonder and creative spirit\nthat I first felt using an Apple Computer 30 years ago.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jony Ive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the\nlast 30 years has led me to this moment. While I am both anxious\nand excited about the responsibility of the substantial work\nahead, I am so grateful for the opportunity to be part of such an\nimportant collaboration. The values and vision of Sam and the\nteams at OpenAI and io are a rare inspiration.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not a fan of the lowercase styling of “io”, but otherwise shoot this into my veins. This industry needs a heavy dose of new ideas for new devices. This is just a vibes teaser, but the vibe is a shot across the bow. It conveys grand ambition, but without pretension. To say I’m keen to get my hands on what they’re making is an understatement.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/21/sam-and-jony-io\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6f8cc4c2055a35637299158bbc469abadea2a856950bb4eb49901ee771d80dae","category":"Tech"}
