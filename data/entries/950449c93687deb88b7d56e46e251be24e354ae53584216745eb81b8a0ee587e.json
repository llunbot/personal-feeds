There are 15 options, with bars ranging from 38-44cm wide and 75-135mm stem lengths.</p>\n<p>While the integrated setup is said to be the most efficient, Specialized says the head tube spacers also work neatly with the old two-piece SL7 cockpit (which will be found on some builds), while the bike can be run with any stem fitting a 1-1/8in steerer.</p>\n<p>Further back, the seat tube has been narrowed to the same width as the SL7’s seatpost, with the new seatpost naturally slimmer again to fit inside.</p>\n<p>This is said to help the “fast moving, dirty” air in this area to pass more efficiently than the previous design, although Specialized doesn’t specify by how much.</p>\n<h2>The Aethos influence</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8\" title=\"Specialized-Tarmac-SL8-94924-03-SW-ETAP-REDSKY-FRYRED-WHT_PAINT_DETAIL\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Behind the leading edges, the tubes (like the down tube) are rounder.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Specialized has also addressed the Tarmac SL8 frame’s weight, stiffness and compliance in a bid to improve the bike’s overall speed on varying terrain, using the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-aethos-comp-review/\">Aethos</a> (the brand’s lightweight road bike) as a starting point.</p>\n<p>Instead of shooting for deeper aero-profiled sections all over the bike, Specialized’s road product manager, Miles Hubbard, says the non-leading edge areas of the bike – the down tube, seat tube, seatpost and seatstays – are all purposefully designed to improve the bike’s speed “in the real world”.</p>\n<p>The tube profiles are marginally rounder than the Tarmac SL7, which the brand says makes them lighter and enables them to bear the load of the rider and the forces produced more efficiently.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, an S-Works frame is set to be the lightest widely used frame in the professional peloton, weighing a claimed 685g in a size 56cm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8\" title=\"Specialized-Tarmac-SL8-94924-03-SW-ETAP-REDSKY-FRYRED-WHT_HEADTUBE\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The S-Works frame comes with the Roval Rapide integrated cockpit launched earlier this year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Fact 10r carbon-framed Tarmac SL8 frames are said to weigh 780g.</p>\n<p>Along with the weight loss (an S-Works Tarmac SL7 frame weighed a claimed 800g), Hubbard says that the Aethos-inspired tube shapes are influential in improving compliance through the saddle by 6 per cent compared to the SL7.</p>\n<p>To cap off the headline claims, Specialized says the bottom bracket, head tube and fork have been stiffened, delivering a net 33 per cent gain in stiffness-to-weight ratio.</p>\n<p>All-in, Specialized says its simulations indicate a pro rider would finish Milan-San Remo 2 minutes, 8 seconds faster than if they were aboard a Tarmac SL7, and would save 20 seconds for a complete ascent and descent of the Tourmalet mountain pass.</p>\n<h2>Front-Loading Development</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Demi Vollering riding Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8\" title=\"Specialized-Tarmac-SL8-Athlete-Demi-1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized started its development process by asking Demi Vollering, Remco Evenepoel and Kasper Asgreen what they wanted from an evolution of the Tarmac SL7.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Specialized says the Tarmac SL8 was produced using what it calls a “Front-Loading Development” process.</p>\n<p>Essentially, this involves a cyclical iterative development process, with Specialized’s engineers going back and forth between virtual carbon modelling, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to iterate the design.</p>\n<p>None of these technologies are new, but Specialized says its use of these tools helps its engineers to remove uncertainty from the development process.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Flow Viz paint on the new Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8\" title=\"Specialized-Tarmac-SL8-FloViz-Hero\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The final iterations of the new Tarmac SL8 were validated in Specialized’s ‘Win’ Tunnel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>In turn, the brand says, its prototypes can be physically tested and achieve figures far closer to the numbers its software says they should, helping it to make more definitive steps forward.</p>\n<p>Applied to the Tarmac SL8, Specialized says it started with its Fact 12r carbon material, its Aethos-developed method for lightweight carbon layup, and the new aero-optimised SL8 frame shape. It then iterated until it landed on the figures (it says) the SL8 delivers.</p>\n<p>The brand says the S-Works Tarmac SL8 represents the 55th iteration it trialled, which it claims would have equated to around 5,000 physical prototype samples.</p>\n<h2>If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Remco Evenepoel riding Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8\" title=\"Specialized-Tarmac-SL8-Athlete-Remco-1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Evenepoel was key in the development of the new Tarmac SL8.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Following requests from the likes of Evenepoel, Vollering and Asgreen, Specialized has stuck almost completely to the same geometry as the Tarmac SL7.</p>\n<p>Only the stack has changed, raised by 10mm as a byproduct of the interaction between the Rapide cockpit and head tube.</p>\n<p>Like the SL7, tyre clearance remains at 32mm, while the bike continues to use a B<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">SA threaded bottom bracket</a>.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Tarmac SL8 availability, prices and specifications</h2>\n<p>The new Specialized Tarmac SL8 is available in five specifications.
