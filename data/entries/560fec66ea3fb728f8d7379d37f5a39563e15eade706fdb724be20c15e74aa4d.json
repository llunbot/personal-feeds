{"title":"Jackass of the Week: Thierry Breton","link":"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-thierry-breton-letter-social-media/","date":1723987253000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Scott, reporting for Politico:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thierry Breton, who oversees the bloc’s enforcement of new social\nmedia rules, <a href=\"https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1823033048109367549/photo/1\">sent Musk a letter posted on X</a> that warned the\ntech mogul about spreading “harmful content,” ahead of Musk’s\n<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-zelenskyy-eu-freewheeling-musk-interview/\">livestreamed interview with Donald Trump</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The tech billionaire quickly clapped back. “To be honest, I really\nwanted to respond with this Tropic Thunder meme,” Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1823076043017630114\">wrote to\nhis almost 200 million followers</a> on X, while posting a\ncurse-laden photo from the 2008 Hollywood blockbuster. “But I\nwould NEVER do something so rude &amp; irresponsible!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even the European Commission thinks he was a jackass for sending this letter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Four separate EU officials, speaking on the condition of\nanonymity, said Breton’s warning to Musk had surprised many within\nthe Commission. The bloc’s enforcers were still investigating the\nplatform for potential wrongdoing and the EU did not want to be\nseen as potentially interfering in the U.S. presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>“The EU is not in the business of electoral interference,” said\none of those officials. “DSA implementation is too important to be\nmisused by an attention-seeking politician in search of his next\nbig job.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09cf4713-7199-4e47-a373-ed5de61c2afa\">The Financial Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The timing and the wording of the letter were neither\nco-ordinated or agreed with the president nor with the\n[commissioners],” it said. An EU official, who asked not to be\nnamed, said: “Thierry has his own mind and way of working and\nthinking.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Musk responded to the letter from Breton with a meme from the 2008\nfilm <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, that showed one character yelling: “Take a\nbig step back and literally fuck your own face.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, Scott reports, we’ll still have Breton to kick around for the foreseeable future:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron backed Breton to\nserve another term at the European Commission. Breton has been\nvocal in his eagerness to hold onto his digital files, according\nto three EU officials with knowledge of the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/18/breton-jackass\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"560fec66ea3fb728f8d7379d37f5a39563e15eade706fdb724be20c15e74aa4d","category":"Tech"}
