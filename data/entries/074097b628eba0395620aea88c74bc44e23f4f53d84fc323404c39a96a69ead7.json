Chinese smartphone maker OPPO recently confirmed that its upcoming Find X8 series will feature a similar camera shutter button (via <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-find-x8-camera-button-iphone-3490115/\"><em>Android Authority</em></a>).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOPPO's product manager, Zhou Yibao, revealed on the Chinese social media platform Weibo that the Find X8 series will include a pressure-sensitive button designed to streamline camera controls. According to Zhou, the button will allow users to quickly launch the camera app with a double-tap and swipe to zoom, with clear parallels to Apple's implementation. Zhou also pointed out that the camera button on OPPO's device has been specifically designed for underwater use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVivo's recently launched X200 series also exhibits similarities to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, boasting 4K video recording at 120 frames per second and cinematic slow-motion video capture—features that align closely with those recently introduced in Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models. The X200 also supports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/\">Live Photos</a> that are compatible with the ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVivo's X200 series also introduces \"Origin Island,\" a dynamic interface feature that bears a striking resemblance to Apple's \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>\" on the ‌iPhone‌. Much like Apple’s implementation, Origin Island provides real-time notifications, multitasking capabilities, and cross-app operations within a single interactive space.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/camera-control/\">Camera Control</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/\">Live Photos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oppo/\">Oppo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vivo/\">Vivo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/chinese-brands-rush-to-copy-iphone-16/\">Chinese Smartphone Brands Rush to Copy iPhone 16 With Camera Button, 'Origin Island,' Live Photos, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chinese-smartphone-brands-rush-to-copy-iphone-16-with-camera-button-origin-island-live-photos-and-more.2440112/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"074097b628eba0395620aea88c74bc44e23f4f53d84fc323404c39a96a69ead7","category":"Apple"}
