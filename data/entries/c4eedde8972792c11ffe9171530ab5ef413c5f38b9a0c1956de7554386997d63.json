The bombastic tri-motor \"Cyberbeast\" is $15,000 cheaper at $99,990, albeit by dropping some previously free features like supercharging and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-fsd-gets-worse-at-driving-nhtsa-opens-new-investigation/\">FSD</a>. And there's now a new $59,990 entry-level model, a dual-motor configuration with a range of 325 miles (523 km) and the same 4.1-second 0–60 mph (0-97 km/h) time as the $79,990 premium all-wheel drive version.</p>\n<p>That actually makes the new entry-level model a good deal, at least in terms of Cybertrucks. Last year, the company <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a66102567/tesla-cybertruck-rear-wheel-drive-canceled/\">introduced and then eliminated</a> a single-motor rear-wheel drive variant, which found few takers when priced at $69,990; an extra motor for $10,000 less is quite a savings, and actually slightly cheaper than the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/the-cheapest-tesla-cybertruck-is-99990-promised-60k-model-canceled/\">price originally advertised for the RWD truck</a>.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, Tesla has made some changes to get down to the new price. The range and 0–60 mph time might be the same as the more expensive dual-motor Cybertruck, but towing capacity is reduced from 11,000 lbs (4,990 kg) to 7,000 lbs (3,175kg), and cargo capacity drops from 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) to 2,006 lbs (910 kg).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/tesla-slashes-cybertruck-prices-as-it-tries-to-move-unpainted-metal/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/tesla-slashes-cybertruck-prices-as-it-tries-to-move-unpainted-metal/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
