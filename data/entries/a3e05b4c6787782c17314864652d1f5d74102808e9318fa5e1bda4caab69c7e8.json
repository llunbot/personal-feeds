After downloading the Meta AI app, Meta AI will ask you personal questions so that it can get to know you, which Meta claims will provide \"more helpful\" answers. Meta AI is \"easy to talk to,\" and has been created to be \"natural to interact with.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Meta AI voice features can be used in the background while multitasking, so you can use other apps while continuing to speak to the AI. Voice conversations will feel personal, relevant, and conversational in tone. The voice conversation feature is available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as of now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app integrates image generation and editing too, both of which can be done through a voice or text conversation with the AI assistant. Llama 4 is able to search the web for finding product recommendations and delving into topics for research, with Meta providing \"conversation starters\" to inspire searches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeta says that it is using its decades of work on personalizing experiences on social media to make Meta AI more personal. It is able to remember facts about you, and it can pick up details based on context. It is also able to draw on information you've already shared on Meta platforms, like your profile and content that you like to engage with to provide more personalized responses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Meta AI app can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free.
