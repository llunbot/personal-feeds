OpenAI engineers took notice and issued a partial fix earlier this month.</p>\n<h2>Strolling down memory lane</h2>\n<p>The vulnerability abused long-term conversation memory, a feature OpenAI began testing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/\">in February</a> and made more broadly available <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/\">in September</a>. Memory with ChatGPT stores information from previous conversations and uses it as context in all future conversations. That way, the LLM can be aware of details such as a user’s age, gender, philosophical beliefs, and pretty much anything else, so those details don’t have to be inputted during each conversation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052198#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052198&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1ff87bb60735218a52fce5a8471219f6f0a96db3cb9a5cc70fa6c54b7910e49a","category":"Tech"}
