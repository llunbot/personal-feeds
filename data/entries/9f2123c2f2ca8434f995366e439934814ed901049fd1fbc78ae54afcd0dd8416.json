This should be no surprise, given\nthat ByteDance is <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/experts-agree-byte-dance-is-beholden-to-the-ccp-and-cannot-be-allowed-to-exploit-americans-data\">legally required</a> to obey CCP directives.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the refusal to sell the app tells us that the Chinese\ngovernment would rather see TikTok destroyed than see it fall into\nAmerican hands. Notably, that same government <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168079/grindr-sold-chinese-owner-us-cfius-security-concerns-kunlun-lgbtq\">put up little\nfuss</a> back in 2020 when the U.S. forced a Chinese company to\nsell the gay dating app Grindr to an American company. Why shut\ndown TikTok and leave untold billions of dollars on the table,\ninstead of just selling the thing like Grindr was sold?</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is that it’s an attempt to make young Americans\nangry, in the hopes that they’ll demand that Trump and Congress\nrepeal the 2024 law. But a simpler explanation is that Chinese\nleaders simply think that TikTok, unlike other apps, is so\nimportant that they would rather destroy it than see it escape\ntheir control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>TikTok is an ingenious propaganda platform. A mass audience — which skews very young — finds it addictively entertaining. But research studies show that the platform squelches topics that aren’t aligned with the CCP. Smith cites two; here’s the abstract <a href=\"https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/Peer-Reviewed-Paper-in-Press_Dec.-2024.pdf\">of the second one</a>, which was published just last month: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Three studies explored how TikTok, a China-owned social media\nplatform, may be manipulated to conceal content critical of China\nwhile amplifying narratives that align with Chinese Communist\nParty objectives. Study I employed a user journey methodology,\nwherein newly created accounts on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube\nwere used to assess the nature and prevalence of content related\nto sensitive Chinese Communist Party (CCP) issues, specifically\nTibet, Tiananmen Square, Uyghur rights, and Xinjiang. The results\nrevealed that content critical of China was made far less\navailable than it was on Instagram and YouTube.</p>\n\n<p>Study II, an extension of Study I, investigated whether the\nprevalence of content that is pro- and anti-CCP on TikTok,\nInstagram, and YouTube aligned with user engagement metrics (likes\nand comments), which social media platforms typically use to\namplify content. The results revealed a disproportionately high\nratio of pro-CCP to anti-CCP content on TikTok, despite users\nengaging significantly more with anti-CCP content, suggesting\npropagandistic manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>Study III involved a survey administered to 1214 Americans that\nassessed their time spent on social media platforms and their\nperceptions of China. Results indicated that TikTok users,\nparticularly heavy users, exhibited significantly more positive\nattitudes towards China’s human rights record and expressed\ngreater favorability towards China as a travel destination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Back to Smith:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In other words, the Chinese government is <em>actively silencing the\nviews of Americans</em> who try to criticize that government. Somehow\nI doubt that the First Amendment’s protection of free speech <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/tiktok-bill-foreign-influence/677806/\">was\nintended to protect</a> the right of foreign governments to\nsilence American individuals from speaking their mind in popular\npublic forums. That would be a very strange definition of “freedom\nof speech”. Of course, I am no legal scholar, so I’ll have to wait\non the Supreme Court to make that judgement, and abide by what\nthey decide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/noah-smith-tiktok-china\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9f2123c2f2ca8434f995366e439934814ed901049fd1fbc78ae54afcd0dd8416","category":"Tech"}
