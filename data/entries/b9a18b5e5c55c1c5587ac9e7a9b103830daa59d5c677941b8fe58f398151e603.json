The feature lets developers add documents to Claude's context window, enabling the model to automatically cite specific passages it uses to generate answers.</p>\n<p>\"When Citations is enabled, the API processes user-provided source documents (PDF documents and plaintext files) by chunking them into sentences,\" Anthropic says. \"These chunked sentences, along with user-provided context, are then passed to the model with the user's query.\"</p>\n<p>The company describes several potential uses for Citations, including summarizing case files with source-linked key points, answering questions across financial documents with traced references, and powering support systems that cite specific product documentation.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-adds-citations-in-bid-to-avoid-confabulating-ai-models/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-adds-citations-in-bid-to-avoid-confabulating-ai-models/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9a18b5e5c55c1c5587ac9e7a9b103830daa59d5c677941b8fe58f398151e603","category":"Tech"}
