{"title":"EU Antitrust Regulators Narrow Apple Antitrust Probe, Zeroing in on Anti-Steering","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/eu-antitrust-regulators-target-apples-134345814.html","date":1677800100000,"content":"\n<p>Paul Sawers, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The European Commission (EC) has confirmed a previously issued\npreliminary view that Apple’s so-called “anti-steering” practices,\nwhich prevent developers from informing users about alternative\npayment options, constitutes unfair trading practices.</p>\n\n<p>However, in a refined Statement of Objections sent to Apple and\n<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_1217\">published for the public today</a>, the EC also said that\nit’s dropping an additional anti-trust charge against the tech\ngiant around the issue of how Apple imposes its own in-app\npurchase (IAP) payment technology on music-streaming service\nproviders. It wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today’s Statement of Objections clarifies that the Commission\ndoes no longer take a position as to the legality of the IAP\nobligation for the purposes of this antitrust investigation but\nrather focuses on the contractual restrictions that Apple imposed\non app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and\niPad users of alternative music subscription options at lower\nprices outside of the app and to effectively choose those.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes the system works. I’ve thought all along that most of the EC’s probe against Apple was overreaching (the stuff about opening up IAP in particular), but Apple’s anti-steering provisions <em>are</em> wrong and either already are illegal or should be made illegal.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/apple-responds-to-eu-narrowing-antitrust-case/\">Joe Rossignol at MacRumors</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a statement shared with MacRumors, an Apple spokesperson\nsaid the company is “pleased” that the Commission has narrowed\nits case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple will continue to work with the European Commission to\nunderstand and respond to their concerns, all the while promoting\ncompetition and choice for European consumers. We’re pleased that\nthe Commission has narrowed its case and is no longer challenging\nApple’s right to collect a commission for digital goods and\nrequire the use of the In-App Payment systems users trust. The App\nStore has helped Spotify become the top music streaming service\nacross Europe and we hope the European Commission will end its\npursuit of a complaint that has no merit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Spotify no longer allows customers to subscribe through its iPhone\napp. A message in the Premium tab of the app informs customers\nthat they “can’t upgrade to Premium in the app” and says “we know,\nit’s not ideal.” The tab does not provide any information or\nexternal links related to subscribing on Spotify’s website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same has been true with Netflix’s app for years. Download it and it has a very obvious button to Sign In, but if you don’t already have a Netflix account, there’s almost no indication what to do to <em>sign up</em>. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing\">I wrote about this back in 2019</a> — you can tap the small “Help” button in the corner and call Netflix on the phone and someone will tell you the answer: that you need to sign up on Netflix’s website.</p>\n\n<p>Putting the legality of Apple’s anti-steering rules aside, I think they make the company look spiteful and petty. They certainly aren’t in the interest of users. Apple is only really Apple when they put the user first. Apple makes gobs of money by selling hardware and software and services that provide people with the best experiences in the world. Anything like this that’s purely about making more money <em>at the expense of</em> the user experience is like a malignant tumor growing on the side of the true Apple. By going after these anti-steering provisions, the EC is doing Apple a favor, despite the fact that some of Apple’s executives can’t see it. The EC might excise that tumor for Apple.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/02/eu-apple-antisteering\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"5dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b93b7060873697633314f7ebb19d4fe2e0f9ec72460126e71fdf11","category":"Tech"}
