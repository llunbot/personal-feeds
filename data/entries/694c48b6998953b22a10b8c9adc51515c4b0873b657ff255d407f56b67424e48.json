And while we like how the system's high-speed storage reduces load times, it also means that expanding the storage <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/the-first-xbox-series-s-x-1tb-storage-expansion-card-costs-220/\">can be expensive</a>.</p>\n<p>That's all preamble for <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/11/xbox-series-s-1tb-black/\">today's announcement</a> of the Carbon Black Xbox Series S, a version of the console with a full 1TB of storage and a $349.99 MSRP. That's about $30 less than you would pay for the standard 512GB Xbox Series S and <a href=\"https://www.westerndigital.com/products/external-drives/wd-black-c50-expansion-card-for-xbox-ssd\">an additional 512GB expansion card</a> these days.</p>\n<p>Aside from that storage capacity, the Carbon Black console—which will launch worldwide on September 1—features the same hardware power as the original Series S. On the outside, though, the low-end console now comes in a brushed black finish like its larger Series X cousin. The design evolution brings to mind the Xbox 360 era, where the white launch consoles were eventually supplemented with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/06/xbox-360-redesign-official-small-wifi-300-shipping-now/\">a shiny black redesign</a> and more storage years after launch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946951#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946951&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"694c48b6998953b22a10b8c9adc51515c4b0873b657ff255d407f56b67424e48","category":"Tech"}
