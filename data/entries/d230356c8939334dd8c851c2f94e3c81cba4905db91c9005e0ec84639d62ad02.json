Much as in-person visitors got some hands-on time with the new iPhones and Apple Watches in the September 2022 event, WWDC 2023 attendees will get to enjoy a bunch of special privileges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/wwdc-2023-apple-park-viewing-event-details/&amp;xcust=1-1-1920345-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors</a> reports, these privileges will include three components that haven’t been available previously: a special tour of Apple Park, an evening activity with food and drinks, and a series of extended developer sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the tour, which takes place in the afternoon of June 5, visitors will be given the choice of two routes: “Inside the Ring” (promising incredible views and a “fascinating” exhibit at The Gallery at Apple Park, which has not previously been open to visitors) or “Inner Meadow” (covering the orchards and pond, among other things).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That evening, attendees will be treated to a “Special Evening Activity” which the company says they “won’t want to miss.” Other than the fact that food and drink will be provided, details of this event are scarce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, developer sessions will take place the day after the keynote presentation, in the morning, afternoon and evening. These will each last two and a half hours and cover “some of the latest announcements” from the WWDC keynote. Obviously we don’t know what they will involve, but there’s a fair chance <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1918145/apple-trademarks-xros-logo-reality-pro-headset-launch.html\">xrOS</a> will be on the menu, along with the usual dishes of iOS, macOS and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly the event is limited to a small number of developers who <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/698158/how-to-apply-wwdc-keynote-watch-apple-park.html\">entered a lottery and were lucky enough to win</a>. If you didn’t hear from Apple by April 5, we’re sorry to say that your name is not on the list–and tickets are non-transferrable. Instead, you will need to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673537/how-to-watch-apple-wwdc-keynote.html\">watch WWDC 2023</a> the same way as the rest of us: online.</p>\n\nApple</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d230356c8939334dd8c851c2f94e3c81cba4905db91c9005e0ec84639d62ad02","category":"Apple"}
