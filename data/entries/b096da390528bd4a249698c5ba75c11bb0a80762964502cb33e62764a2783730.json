He showed that, by masquerading as an authoritative DNS server and using it to flood a DNS resolver with fake lookup results for a trusted domain, an attacker could poison the resolver cache with the spoofed IP address. From then on, anyone relying on the same resolver would be diverted to the same imposter site.</p>\n<h2>A lack of entropy</h2>\n<p>The sleight of hand worked because DNS at the time relied on a transaction ID to prove the IP number returned came from an authoritative server rather than an imposter server attempting to send people to a malicious site. The transaction number had only 16 bits, which meant that there were only 65,536 possible transaction IDs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813667#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813667&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b096da390528bd4a249698c5ba75c11bb0a80762964502cb33e62764a2783730","category":"Tech"}
