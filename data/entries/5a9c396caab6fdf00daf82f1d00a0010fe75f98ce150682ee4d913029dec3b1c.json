The brand says it adds “extremely tiny, nano-scale particles to the resin that binds the individual carbon fibres together” during manufacture.</p>\n<p>This is claimed to improve the carbon fibre’s resistance to damage by up to 40 per cent.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida down tube logo on Merida Big.Nine 10k\" title=\"Merida down tube logo on Merida Big.Nine 10k\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can mount two bottle cages on the down tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The frame is available in three configurations – an aluminium option and two carbon variants. The top-of-the-line CF5 carbon frame featured on this bike weighs a claimed 880g in a size medium, with the more affordable CF3 weighing a claimed 1,100g.</p>\n<p>Merida says it has also focused on improving comfort. This is achieved primarily by speccing wider 2.4in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a> and the fact the standover height is much lower than its predecessor, meaning there’s more <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a> exposed to flex.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida Big.Nine 10k flexstay rear-end\" title=\"AL_MBUK_LOW-RES_26723021\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The flexstay sees the seatstay faces flattened for improved claimed compliance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Additionally, the Big.Nine uses a flexstay, which is commonplace on many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">best mountain bikes</a>, to boost rear-end comfort.</p>\n<p>Merida has ditched the BB92 press-fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket standard</a> and moved to a BSA threaded variant instead.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Under top tube bosses on Merida Big.Nine 10k\" title=\"Under top tube bosses on Merida Big.Nine 10k\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You also get bosses under the top tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Big.Nine relies on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">SRAM UDH</a> and accepts a 30.9mm-diameter seatpost.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Integrated front-end of Merida Big.Nine 10k\" title=\"AL_MBUK_LOW-RES_26723016\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It looks as though integration is here to stay.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Big.Nine also now integrates its cables and hoses via the use of a proprietary Acros headset cover, an emerging trend on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country bikes</a>.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>What is Bike of the Week?</h3>\n<p>Every fortnight, we’ll bring you a detailed first look at one of the latest bikes (or framesets) to arrive at BikeRadar HQ – from road to commuting, gravel to enduro, and anything in between.</p>\n<p>This is our chance to introduce the bike and everything that makes it unique before hitting the road or trails.</p>\n<p>Head to our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/\">Bike of the Week hub</a> for previous editions.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Revamped, size-specific geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Integrated front-end of Merida Big.Nine 10k\" title=\"Integrated front-end of Merida Big.Nine 10k\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The head tube slackens to 67 degrees on the Big.Nine TR, due to the longer-travel fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Merida Big.Nine receives the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/spoke-tension-is-long-slack-and-low-geometry-always-better-our-tech-experts-give-us-their-angle/\">longer, lower and slacker treatment</a>, and moves to the brand’s Agilometer reach-based sizing system.</p>\n<p>The system, first debuted on Merida’s all-mountain and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro bikes</a>, pairs shorter seat tubes and stack heights with longer reaches. Therefore, you can pick between a long and stable bike without compromising on dropper-post drop or a shorter, more agile bike.</p>\n<p>The Big.Nine’s head tube angle has been slackened from 70 degrees to 68 and the seat tube angle is now 75.3 rather than 73.5 degrees. The reach is longer at 452mm on a size medium.</p>\n<p>Merida alters the chainstay length for each size of bike, which isn’t something many brands do.
