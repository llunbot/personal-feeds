The company is going bigger, and it has already started to do so.</p>\n<p>In an interview with Ars, the company's chief executive, Tim Ellis, discussed the cause of its Terran 1 launch failure and lessons learned for the future and looked ahead to big changes planned for the company's next launch vehicle.</p>\n<p>Foremost among these changes is the plan to move directly into development of the Terran R rocket. In response to customer demand, Ellis said, this rocket is getting even bigger than before. A fully expendable version will now be able to lift a staggering 33.5 metric tons. This sets up Relativity to compete directly with the largest players in the global launch industry.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930939#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930939&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1eea5de608da268dc02ea8f515236327450e7ec8abce895cac81917c2c118212","category":"Tech"}
