There are also price cuts on the PS5 <em>God of War Ragnar√∂k</em> bundle and Apple's four-pack of AirTags.</p>\n<h3>Nintendo Switch OLED for <a href=\"https://www.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-model-6?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_1\" target=\"_blank\">$310</a> ($350)</h3>\n<p>Nintendo's Switch OLED is the best Switch console you can buy. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">In our review</a>, we praised the larger, upgraded display's completely blacked-out pixels and infinite contrast ratio whether gaming before bed or during the day. We also appreciated the bigger, sturdier hinge, Ethernet-toting dock, and 64GB standard storage, as opposed to 32GB on other Switch models.</p>\n<p>We still think the Switch Lite is an unbeatable deal in portable gaming for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ntjWzW\" target=\"_blank\">$200</a>, but for those among us who like the best of the best, the Switch OLED is the ultimate portable gaming device. With today's one-day-only <a href=\"https://www.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-model-6?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_1\" target=\"_blank\">$40 discount</a>, it's a bit more affordable now, too. Samsung's 256GB microSD Evo Select is also on sale for <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/evo-select-adapter-microsdxc-256gb-mb-me256ka-am/\" target=\"_blank\">$20</a>, which pairs well with the Switch for game storage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927050#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927050&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af1a6938d7dce01f9bf7d8b8015159ece49ec2f507d7f7f4e558344fcfedce8a","category":"Tech"}
