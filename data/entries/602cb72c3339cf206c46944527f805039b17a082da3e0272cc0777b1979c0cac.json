But nearly a decade later, Google’s project and many others have <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ford-abandons-the-self-driving-road-to-nowhere/\">fallen far behind</a> their own predictions of the timeline for success. Growing fleets, fancier sensors, and tighter budgets are forcing companies working on robotaxi and robofreight services to get pickier about what stays on their servers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938865#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938865&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"602cb72c3339cf206c46944527f805039b17a082da3e0272cc0777b1979c0cac","category":"Tech"}
