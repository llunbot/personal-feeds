From top-tier brands people would recognize under Tour de France riders to start-up companies making modular bikes for hectic lifestyles, everyone seems to be getting on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While power, speed, range, and features have become the lynchpins for most e-bike buyers, a sleek, stylish design still sits at the top of the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-800x532.jpg\" alt=\"Volcon Brat e-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-800x532.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-297x197.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-768x510.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-6-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Volcon’s Brat is as close as an e-bike gets to a sporty cafe racer.

Volcon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of e-bikes are so large and feature tires fat enough that they feel more like motorcycles, but it’s not every day that a brand leans into the gray area separating the two with a bike that’s more cafe racer than pedal-pusher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volcon ePowersports of Round Rock, Texas, has done just that with its new <a href=\"https://www.volcon.com/brat?utm_source=bikerumor_gearjunkie&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_content&amp;utm_campaign=brat_endemic&amp;utm_term=custom_article\" target=\"_blank\">Volcon Brat e-bike designed for commutes and off-road ripping</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Volcon Brat: Pedal-Powered Cafe Racer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.volcon.com/brat?utm_source=bikerumor_gearjunkie&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_content&amp;utm_campaign=brat_endemic&amp;utm_term=custom_article\" target=\"_blank\">Volcon Brat</a> comes loaded with beefy 20- by 4.5-inch tires that are for perfect rolling over chunky terrain, along with a 750W/1200W max motor with a 30 to 70+ mile range, depending on ride mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a max speed of 28 mph in off-road mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.volcon.com/brat?utm_source=bikerumor_gearjunkie&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_content&amp;utm_campaign=brat_endemic&amp;utm_term=custom_article\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-800x532.jpg\" alt=\"Volcon Brat e-bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-800x532.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Brat features a powerful LED light perfect for hitting the road or trails when the sun goes down. Photo c. Volcon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what sets the Brat apart from the competition isn’t just its tech specs, but its unique design. At first glance, it’s easy to skip over the fact that this thing even has pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Brat was inspired by the classic look and feel of a cafe racer but is considered a Class 2 e-bike. It features full suspension and Volcon’s distinctive Exo-Arch frame, similar to the brand’s off-road electric motorcycle, the <a href=\"https://www.volcon.com/grunt-evo\" target=\"_blank\">Grunt EVO</a>. The combination of style and performance sets the Brat apart from other e-bikes as a platform for adventure, whether cruising through city streets, at the beach, or on local bike trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep the cafe-racer aesthetic consistent, the Brat features a 48V 15.6Ah removable battery with a locking feature mounted to the frame of the bike in about the same place you’d expect a motorcycle engine, as well as a large, powerful LED billet-style headlight up front that is a stark contrast to anything you’d expect to see on a traditional e-bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes with a top attachment that mimics a gas tank but doubles as a lockable compartment to store all your ride essentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an inverted telescoping adjustable fork up front, the Brat promises to be smooth over pavement or dirt. The fork includes an easy-to-reach adjustment knob beneath the handlebar, making it easy to customize the feel of the ride on the fly as conditions change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Display and Ride Modes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.volcon.com/brat?utm_source=bikerumor_gearjunkie&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_content&amp;utm_campaign=brat_endemic&amp;utm_term=custom_article\" target=\"_blank\">Brat</a> comes with an onboard 4-inch color display with Bluetooth connectivity and a D-pad. It displays battery level, speed, max speed, average speed, trip distance, and an odometer. It also includes a USB charger inside the locking “gas tank” storage area.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.volcon.com/brat?utm_source=bikerumor_gearjunkie&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_content&amp;utm_campaign=brat_endemic&amp;utm_term=custom_article\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"531\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-5-800x531.jpg\" alt=\"Volcon Brat e-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-5-800x531.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-5-297x197.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-5-768x509.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-5-1536x1019.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/volcon-brat-5-2048x1358.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>The Volcon Brat features an unmistakable design that brings cafe-racer style to a capable e-bike. Photo c. Volcon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It features a single-speed drivetrain bolstered by four distinct ride modes. Mode 1 offers minimal assistance and maximum battery life. This feature kicks on the motor to offer pedaling assistance but does not engage the throttle. Mode 2 offers light power and throttled acceleration ideal for urban commuting. Mode 3 offers increased power and acceleration up to 20 mph and an off-road mode. A twist of the throttle will get the bike up to speed quickly. Mode 4 also offers an off-road mode and delivers maximum power ideal for leaving the pavement behind and hitting the trails. To enable off-road mode and reach top speeds of 28 mph, riders have to sign a waiver in the Volcon app agreeing not to use off-road speeds in on-road environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>More Specs:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weight: 86 lbs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brakes: Hydraulic disc</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drivetrain: Single-speed, chain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seat height: 30″</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Volcon Brat Colors and Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.volcon.com/brat?utm_source=bikerumor_gearjunkie&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_content&amp;utm_campaign=brat_endemic&amp;utm_term=custom_article\" target=\"_blank\">Volcon Brat</a> comes in two colors: black and blue.
