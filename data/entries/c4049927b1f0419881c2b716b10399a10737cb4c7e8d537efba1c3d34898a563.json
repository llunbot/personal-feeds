Luffy in <em>One Piece</em>, the Netflix live-action adaptation of the popular Japanese manga and anime franchise. </p></div>\n<p>We're eagerly counting down to the premiere of Netflix's live-action series adaptation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece_(2023_TV_series)\"><em>One Piece</em></a> on Friday, a hugely popular manga and anime series created by Eiichiro Oda.

They're searching for the legendary One Piece, a mythical treasure that would make anyone who possesses it King of the Pirates.
