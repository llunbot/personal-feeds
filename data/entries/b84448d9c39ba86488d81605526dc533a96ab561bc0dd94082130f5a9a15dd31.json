With a rest day to follow, the GC riders must give their all to end the first week on a high note. The stage features an eye-watering 4,700 metres of climbing over 188km.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/la-vuelta-a-espana-2021-preview\"><b><i>Vuelta 2021 Guide</i></b></a></p>\n<div></div>\n<h4><b>Route</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/VE21-Altimetriasv4-9_1024x1024.png?v=1629462369\" />Stage 9 profile</span></i></p>\n<p><span>The peloton departs from Puerto Lumbreras, which first hosted a Vuelta stage start in 1979. The breakaway will form in the first 50km, where the road is downhill and flat. This changes swiftly with the Alto de Cuatro Vientos. The second category ascent is 10.5km and averages a mere 3.8%. This doesn’t tell the full story, though — a descent 3km into the climb heavily reduces the average gradient.</span></p>\n<p><span>After an intermediate sprint in Tijola, which occurs with 87km left, the ‘real’ climbing begins with the Alto Collado Venta Lui. The first category climb offers 10 KOM points to the first rider across, and averages 4.4% over an astonishing 29km. However, numerous plateau sections make these figures somewhat deceiving. The hardest section comes between kilometres 16 and 23 — here the gradient averages 9.2%, with some sections exceeding 12%.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/E09-V.Luisa-VE021_600x600.jpg?v=1629462976\" /></span></p>\n<p><em><span>Alto Collado Venta Luisa profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The third category Alto de Castro de Filabres is next, which is 7.1km long and 3.9% on average. In typical fashion, a descent 2km in heavily impacts the average gradient — when the road does go uphill, it averages closer to 5.5%. Bonus seconds are available to the first three rides across, which could encourage attacks from general classification riders if the breakaway is caught.</span></p>\n<p><span>A descent then carries the riders to the final effort. </span><span><span>The Alto de Velefique averages 6.4% over 13.2km and is the first special category climb of the 2021 route. The opening 5km are the most challenging. Here, some kilometres average close to a leg-sapping 12%. That said, stage contenders must keep something in reserve for the final 8km which averages 6.3%.</span></span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/E09-Velefique-VE021_600x600.jpg?v=1629463296\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Alto de Velefique profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The <span>Velefique </span>concluded stage 12 of the 2009 Vuelta a España — Canadian Ryder Hesjedal was the first to the top and over three minutes seperated the first 30 riders. We can expect a similar degree of carnage here.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20211908VUE027-Photogomezsport-min_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1629462323\" />Adam Yates, Richard Carapaz and Alex Aranburu (Image credit: Luis Angel Gomez / ASO)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Although they don’t hold the red jersey, the Ineos Grenadiers have had a fair start to the Vuelta a España. </span><b>Adam Yates </b><span>and </span><b>Richard Carapaz</b><span> are still in contention, but have both leaked time on various uphill finishes. With that in mind, Giro d’Italia champion </span><b>Egan Bernal </b><span>looks to be the Grenadiers' leading rider and starts in the top five overall. They could send any of the aformentioned trio up the road early, but are more likely to hold their cards close to their chest until the Alto de Velefique.</span></p>\n<p><b>Primož Roglič</b> <span>started in Burgos as the heavy pre-race favourite, and to this point, he has lived up to the billing. He won the stage one time trial and has been among the best on the uphill finishes. If anyone is to challenge </span><span>Roglič in his</span><span> quest for a third straight red jersey, attacking Jumbo-Visma early in the stage may be their best option. </span><b>Sepp Kuss</b><span> and </span><b>Steven Kruijswijk</b><span> haven’t performed to their expected level so far, so isolating </span><span>Roglič</span><span> early is a possibility.</span></p>\n<p><span>Movistar currently hold second, third and fourth overall, and therefore look to be in the best position to unseat<span> </span></span><span>Roglič</span><span>. This makes their tactical decisions intriguing. Movistar Head of Performance Patxi Vila commented on Movistar’s leadership prior to stage 6, “Normally, you don’t have to decide, the race decides, you know? I can say, Alejandro (Valverde) normally, he won’t fight for GC”.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now racing his 15th Vuelta a España, <strong>Alejandro Valverde</strong> isn't Movistar's primary option. With <strong>Enric Mas</strong> and <strong>Miguel Ángel López </strong>leading the team, </span><span>stage 9 provides a great platform for Movistar to be aggressive.</span></p>\n<p><span>Trek-Segafredo have enjoyed a successful first week at La Vuelta, which is largely down to </span><b>Kenny Elisonnde’s</b><span> brief spell in red. He’s back to </span><i><span>domestique </span></i><span>duty now, however, and will be working for </span><b>Giulio Ciccone</b><span>. The Italian was highly impressive at the Giro d’Italia earlier this season before a crash forced him to withdraw. </span><strong>Juan Pedro López</strong><span> has ridden a fine race too — he’ll be supporting Ciccone late in the stage.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bahrain-Victorious entered with a plethora of strong climbers. </span><b>Mikel Landa</b><span> is their best placed rider in the GC, even though he lost time on the short, punchy Alto de la Montaña de Cullera. With <strong>Jack Haig</strong></span><b>, Wout Poels </b><span>and </span><b>Mark Padun</b><span> further back, Bahrain could be given the freedom to send multiple riders up the road.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some expressed surprise to hear of </span><b>Fabio Aru's</b> impending retirement.<span> The 31-year-old won the Vuelta a España in 2015, but has faced a range of challenges in recent years. However, his form has improved in 2021 —</span><span> he was second overall at the Vuelta a Burgos earlier this month. Can he retain his place in the top ten in his final Grand Tour?</span></p>\n<p><span>Keep an eye on </span><b>Alex Vlasov, Felix Großschartner </b><span>and </span><b>David de la Cruz, </b>who are all contending for the GC too.</p>\n<p><span>If a large breakaway goes clear early, they have a good chance of holding on for the stage. Keep an eye on </span><b>Michael Storer, Rafal Majka, Sepp Kuss, Geoffrey Bouchard </b><span>and </span><b>Jack Haig</b><span> from a breakaway group.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"b84448d9c39ba86488d81605526dc533a96ab561bc0dd94082130f5a9a15dd31","category":"Cycling"}
