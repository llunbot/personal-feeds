Mac revenue for all of 2023 was $29.4 billion, down from $40.2 billion in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CFO Luca Maestri attributed the drop to challenging market conditions and challenging compares to last year's Mac lineup. Because of supply chain issues during the June 2022 quarter, Mac sales spiked in the September 2022 quarter, which did not happen this year. Apple also updated the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> in June 2023 rather than September, which impacted September quarter sales compared to last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did release new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max Macs in late October, but sales of those devices will be reflected in the December quarter. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> told <em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html\">CNBC</a></em> that he expects Mac performance to improve over the holidays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter,\" said Cook. \"We've got the M3, we've got the new products, and we don't have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis,\" Cook said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple began allowing customers to purchase the new M3 Macs on Monday, with shipments to begin arriving next week. Apple appears to have plenty of supply of the new models, so there should be no supply constraints during the upcoming holidays.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">Earnings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/\">Mac Revenue Down 34% Year-Over-Year, But Tim Cook Expects 'Significant' Improvement With M3 Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-revenue-down-34-year-over-year-but-tim-cook-expects-significant-improvement-with-m3-macs.2409676/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c4ef74247a530988c0dd0c520ee6fd7a2ecad53a923d893ae764dd8c12379f2a","category":"Apple"}
