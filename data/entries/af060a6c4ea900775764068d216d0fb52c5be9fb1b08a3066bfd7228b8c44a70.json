Oh Dear is a website monitor that offers peace of mind as a service. If you run a website and your website is down, you know what would-be visitors do: they close the tab and move on to the next site. When’s the last time <em>you</em> waited more than a few seconds for a site to load? If your site is monitored by Oh Dear, you’ll find out right way when it’s down, however you want to be notified — through email, SMS, Slack, webhooks, or any of <a href=\"https://ohdear.app/features/notifications\">a bunch of other options</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Oh Dear is not your average website monitor. They’re an all-in-one service offering complete website coverage, and of particular note for the discerning DF audience, Oh Dear is obsessive about their user interface and experience. Nerdy, yes, but beautiful too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/10/oh-dear\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"af060a6c4ea900775764068d216d0fb52c5be9fb1b08a3066bfd7228b8c44a70","category":"Tech"}
