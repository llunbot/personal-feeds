Now, robots work alongside people on production lines, excelling at tasks like manipulating parts too heavy for humans to easily lift or welding or bonding <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/misaligned-factory-robot-may-have-sparked-chevy-bolt-battery-fires/\">with more precision than we can manage</a>.</p>\n<p>Those robots <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/small-batch-evs-and-plenty-of-robots-hyundais-new-innovation-center/\">mostly look like big multi-axis arms</a>, but a new breed of two-armed, two-legged robots is being tested in car factories. BMW is the latest automaker to try them at its factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina.</p>\n<p>Unlike Tesla, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-an-ai-company-now-heres-how-plausible-that-is/\">which hopes to develop its own bipedal 'bot</a> to work on its production line sometime next year, BMW has brought in a robot from Figure AI. The Figure 02 robot has hands with sixteen degrees of freedom and human-equivalent strength.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041292#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041292&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
