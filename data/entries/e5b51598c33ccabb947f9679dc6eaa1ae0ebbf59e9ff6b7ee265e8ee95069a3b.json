{"title":"Intel fills out Core Ultra 200 laptop chips with hodgepodge of CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-rounds-out-core-ultra-200-laptop-cpus-with-new-but-less-advanced-models/","date":1736172027000,"content":"<p>Intel's Core Ultra 200 series is currently bifurcated between two architectures: Lunar Lake, which powers the Core Ultra 200V series of laptop chips; and Arrow Lake, which is included in the Core Ultra 200S desktop processors. Arrow Lake processors can include many more CPU cores, but only Lunar Lake uses Intel's latest GPU architecture and a neural processing unit (NPU) fast enough for Microsoft's Copilot+ functionality.</p>\n<p>Intel is rounding out the rest of the Core Ultra 200 family today at CES, and the most important thing to know is that it's Arrow Lake, and not Lunar Lake, that is powering all of these new processors (though with a major caveat for 200U series chips, more on that in a bit).</p>\n<p>This means that none of them are fast enough to earn <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/\">the Copilot+ label</a> or use upcoming features like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsofts-controversial-recall-scraper-is-finally-entering-public-preview/\">Windows Recall</a>, and none of them will have integrated graphics that are as good as the Core Ultra 200V. But it will make them a better fit for gaming laptops and other kinds of systems that prioritize CPU performance or include an external graphics card, as well as less-expensive ultraportable laptops.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-rounds-out-core-ultra-200-laptop-cpus-with-new-but-less-advanced-models/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-rounds-out-core-ultra-200-laptop-cpus-with-new-but-less-advanced-models/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e5b51598c33ccabb947f9679dc6eaa1ae0ebbf59e9ff6b7ee265e8ee95069a3b","category":"Tech"}
