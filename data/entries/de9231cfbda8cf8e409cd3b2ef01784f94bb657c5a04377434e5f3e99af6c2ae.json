Michael Steeber <a href=\"https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/apple-tysons-corner-a-new-chapter\">shared detailed images</a> of the experience, highlighting the Genius Bar, a hardware flex space, an Apple Watch Studio, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/tysons-corner-apple-store-genius-bar.jpg\" alt width=\"1456\" height=\"942\" />\r<br />\nApple has moved away from physical Genius Bar sections in its stores in recent years, but Tysons Corner has a dedicated Genius Bar in the right corner, similar to the original store. As Steeber points out, this is the first actual Genius Bar that Apple has installed in a store since 2015, though the concept of the Genius Bar never went away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a flexible hardware space at Tysons Corner, which Steeber says is designed to spotlight Apple's latest hardware. Apple has also included an in-person Apple Watch Studio where customers can mix and match Apple Watch cases and bands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Had so much fun getting a FIRST LOOK at the newly relocated Apple Tysons Corner (the very first Apple Store!) before tomorrow’s grand opening!!!
