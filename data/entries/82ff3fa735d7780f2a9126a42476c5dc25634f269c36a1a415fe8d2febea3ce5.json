The Wahoo RFLKT was the first bit of tech to really stand out, but the Atlanta, Georgia-based company really hit their stride with the Wahoo KICKR line of smart trainers and ELEMNT GPS computers.</p>\n<p>Today?  Wahoo Fitness is a much more sprawling sports tech company selling a massive array of hardware and software solutions. The only problem is that finances couldn’t keep up.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/05/giant-stages-negotiations-end/\" target=\"_blank\">Giant ends $20 million investment negotiations with Stages Cycling</a></p>\n<p>Just a month after Wahoo’s credit rating was downgraded to a grade ‘D’ by Moody’s Investors due to a missed debt service payment, Wahoo has found a solution. Here’s what they said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Wahoo has fully recapitalized its business with significant equity support from new and current investors with substantial experience in supporting diverse connected fitness and endurance athlete platform businesses.</p>\n<p>“Confidential terms of the arrangements eliminate all debt and provide significant cash liquidity designed to extend the company’s prominence in advancing innovation in the global smart fitness and training category.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wahoo says its founder, Chip Hawkins, led the recapitalization alongside new and current investors. Hawkins sold off a majority share of Wahoo Fitness to a private equity firm in June 2021 right at the peak of indoor cycling tech sales. But when that ended, a number of issues cascaded into what there is today.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wahoo-elemnt-bolt-computer-shining-light.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Wahoo-elemnt-bolt-computer-shining-light\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1124\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wahoo-elemnt-bolt-computer-shining-light.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wahoo-elemnt-bolt-computer-shining-light.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>A light at the end of the tunnel for Wahoo Fitness.

Here’s to the company finding its stride again as it had in the past, perhaps with a bit of a refocusing on “delighting its customers and continuing Wahoo’s mission of building a better athlete in all of us,” per Hawkins.</p>\n<p>And hopefully, the cycling tech company won’t need to be floated by Hawkins’ other company, <a href=\"https://www.wahoodocks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Docks</a>.</p>","author":"Alvin Holbrook","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"82ff3fa735d7780f2a9126a42476c5dc25634f269c36a1a415fe8d2febea3ce5","category":"Cycling"}
