This change would have the Pixel Watch line changing from Samsung to Qualcomm SoCs.</p>\n<p>The original Pixel Watch shipped with an Exynos 9110—not a bad chip by any means—except that when the Pixel Watch hit the market, the Exynos 9110 was four years old. As a 10 nm, dual Cortex A53 chip, it was ancient by technology standards. By the time the Pixel Watch came out, Samsung already had a next-generation chip on the market, the Exynos W920, and had shipped watches with the new chip.</p>\n<p>While the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear W5 still has the same A53 CPUs, it has four of them, and the chip should be a lot more power efficient thanks to its 4 nm manufacturing process. The Pixel Watch 2 is expected to come out by the end of the year, and by then, the Snapdragon W5 SoC will be no spring chicken either. The chip was announced in July 2022, and the first products hit the market a month later in <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_watch_3_and_watch_3_pro_launch_with_snapdragon_w5_gen_1-news-55372.php\">August 2022</a>—that's what a good technology rollout looks like, by the way. The Pixel Watch 2's assumed October 2023 release date would be 15 months after the chip was announced. That's better than four years, but time still seems to be Google's biggest enemy when it ships a smartwatch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943208#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943208&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4f76d53a16a7d7fa60c085479305444be5688838105ee5c54ca297720f9dbe6","category":"Tech"}
