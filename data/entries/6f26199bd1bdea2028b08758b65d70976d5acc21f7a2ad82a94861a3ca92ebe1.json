It’s generally advised that you should have 10% of your total space free on your Mac for the most optimum working. If you are down to your last few gigabytes then it’s time to do some housework and grab some space back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, a Mac is likely to accumulate a large collection of duplicate files that take up this valuable space so that’s a good place to start. However, finding and deleting them can be time-consuming if you do it one by one, so in this article, we show you quicker ways to cleanse your system of these delinquent doppelgängers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why do I have duplicate files?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases these will be mistaken downloads (caused by clicking on a link twice), Mail and Messages attachments, a convoluted filing system, a bad habit of dragging things to your desktop, or a number of other possibilities. Unless you’re an unusually fastidious Mac user, duplicates are going to turn up one way or another.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is it possible to find duplicate files on Mac without using third-party software? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to search for and delete duplicate files in macOS, but macOS itself doesn’t have a duplicate file finder. You can however use Smart Folders in the Finder to locate files that are the same (or similar) and use features like Quick Look to help you decide whether to delete them. There is also a command you can use in Terminal, although we didn’t have much luck with that method. We’ll explain how both methods work below, as well as run through some of the easy to use third-party options. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to find duplicates using the Finder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to locate duplicate files on your system by using the Smart Folders feature in the Finder.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3679414/how_to_find_and_delete_duplicate_files_on_mac_finder1.png\" alt=\"How to find and delete duplicate files on Mac: Finder Smart Folders\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"How to find and delete duplicate files on Mac: Finder Smart Folders\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"How to find and delete duplicate files on Mac: Finder Smart Folders\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start by opening the Finder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Navigate to File &gt; New Smart Folder in the menu.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the ‘+’ button in the upper-right corner.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now choose what you want to search by to locate the duplicate files, e.g. Kind = Image or Kind = Document. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can search for documents, photos, music, or several other files types. The key is how you sort the results. Ordering them by name should bring up any duplicates that are easy to spot.

While the name might be more in keeping with a dystopian sci-fi novel, the app is a powerful tool for your Mac. </p>\n\n<p>Once you have granted permission to scan your folders Gemini 2 will go ahead and Scan for Duplicates. The scan of our 256GB drive (with about 150GB files) took about seven minutes. When the scan had finished it had turned up 12.63GB worth of duplicates. </p>\n\n<p>Gemini 2 selected 45.6MB files automatically – these were duplicated photos. We were able to automatically delete these by clicking on Smart Cleanup. </p>\n\n<p>However, there were still GBs of files left that were ripe for removal. It is possible to sort through the duplicates and choose which version to keep. Click on Select More to go through all of the duplicates that Gemini has found. You can flick through these and decide which ones you want to lose. It’s a bit of a drag that you have to do this manually, but it’s still easier, and more visual, than using the Finder. You can also choose to delete every instance of the file or photo if you really don’t need it.</p>\n\n<p>Since we were removing photos Gemini reminded us that we need to also remove the photos from Recently Deleted in Photos, alternatively, we could wait 30 days for them to be removed automatically.

There are two versions of the software – a free and a Pro version. The latter adds a few extra features, such as the ability to merge folders, and restore removed duplicates.

There is also a one-time purchase option for $69.90 (£56) which is currently reduced to $49.95 (£39.90). </p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to grant it permission to scan various folders and sections of your Mac. The software will then scan for duplicates with some fancy graphs representing the kind of files it has found. </p>\n\n<p>You can then click on the Cleanup Hints section to find some files to delete. At every step there is a detailed overlay showing you what to do. Just click on the x to remove it. </p>\n\n<p>In each case, you can review the duplicate before deleting it. As with Gemini, you can remove the duplicates or you can remove all versions of the file or photo. The Review and Remove option does let you see a visual of where the duplicated file was located, which might be useful. </p>\n\n<p>You can also choose Auto Select to pick the duplicates for you – you can even refine the selection. You get to review these before they are removed.</p>\n\n<p>Duplicate File Finder creates a Duplicates album in Photos, which you will need to delete within the Photo app. You will also have to remove these from Recently Deleted.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

You will still need to remove them manually, but it might simplify the hunt. Just beware that if you aren’t familiar with the Mac operating system you could accidentally delete files you need. So tread cautiously. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Terminal (the quickest way to do this is to press Space + Command and start typing Terminal). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter cd ~/[name of the folder you want to investigate]. e.g. cd ~/Documents</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paste in: find ./ -type f -exec md5 {} \\; | awk -F ‘=’ ‘{print $2 “\\t” $1}’ | sort | tee duplicates.txt </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Press Return. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Documents folder you will find a new text document including duplicates, if it finds any. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It took some time for Terminal to locate the duplicates in our Desktop file, but eventually, we had a list of files that were duplicates along with the location they could be found in It was then required that we locate and delete each of those files. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png\" alt=\"Delete duplicates Terminal\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 921w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?resize=300%2C285&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?resize=768%2C730&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"921\" height=\"875\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Delete duplicates Terminal\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 921w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?resize=300%2C285&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?resize=768%2C730&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"921\" height=\"875\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Delete duplicates Terminal\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 921w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?resize=300%2C285&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duplicate-files-Terminal-1.png?resize=768%2C730&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"921\" height=\"875\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How accurate are duplicate file-finding tools on a Mac?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We found the tools we used to be accurate. One of the issues with finding duplicate files is that some files are named differently, but still duplicates. Using the Finder to locate these is a lot harder and can be time-consuming. We found that using a third party tool helped us identify these duplicates. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should you do after finding duplicate files on Mac?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have located a file that can be deleted you need only drag it to the Trash (Bin). You can then empty the Trash by right-clicking on it and choosing Empty Bin. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will deleting duplicate files affect my Mac’s performance?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Mac is running slowly because you are running out of space deleting duplicates and making more space will speed things up.
