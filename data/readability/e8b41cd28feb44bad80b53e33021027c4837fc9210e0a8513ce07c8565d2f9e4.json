Closing out another year of product shortages, zoom presentations, and uncertainty. One thing&nbsp;<em>is</em> certain though. The bicycle has continued to be an indispensable form of two-wheel therapy for myself and a growing number of riders around the globe. While it’s been a weird year for product launches, there have been several products that have risen above the rest. Products we could actually get our hands on. Which these days, seems like a feature in itself.</p><p>With a few notable exceptions, 2021 felt like it wasn’t a huge year for the bike industry in terms of product launches. But if anything, it allowed us more time on our home trails, getting back to the reason we all got into this gig in the first place.</p><h2>About Zach</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 \" width=\"1512\" height=\"1812\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor.jpg 1512w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor-250x300.jpg 250w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor-800x959.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor-100x120.jpg 100w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor-768x920.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08113401/Zach-Editors-choice-2021-bikerumor-1282x1536.jpg 1282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\"></a></p><p>The perfect bike doesn’t exist. Which is why you need so many of them—or at least that’s what I tell myself when thinking about the next build. I got my start in the industry because I was obsessed with working on bikes more than I was riding them, but that’s changed over the years. I still love working on bikes and would rather buy a $400 tool than pay someone else $20 to do it for me, but now I’m just as happy with bikes that need as little maintenance as possible, leaving more time for, you know, actually riding.</p><p>I still ride a bit of everything, but this year it was mostly MTB, gravel, bikepacking, and road riding. And e-cargo bikes. And pumptracks. Oh, and fat bikes. I guess you could say I change riding styles with the seasons, but I will say that I think I rode more gravel bikes this year than ever before. Mostly because I can grab a gravel bike, head out from the house, make my way quickly on pavement to the good stuff, and then rip through most terrain before looping back to the house. I love how gravel bikes make easy mountain bike trails more challenging all while improving your fitness for the big days on real mountain bike trails.</p><h2>Experience</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124216/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing20.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124216/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing20.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 bikepacking\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124216/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing20.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124216/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing20-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124216/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing20-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124216/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing20-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124216/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing20-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>All of my top rides this year have things in common: friends, gravel or mountain bikes, camping, and a sense of adventure. This year, some of my oldest riding buddies and I planned a bikepacking trip based on a route we found from Bikepacking.com. If you haven’t checked out their <a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/bikepacking-routes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">route-finding tool</a>, it’s a great resource for planning a bikepacking trip—even if time is at a premium. Between travel time and balancing the schedules of three dads with young kids, carving out enough time to bag even an overnighter was a challenge, but&nbsp;<em>so</em> worth it.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124204/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing15.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124204/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing15.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 bikepacking\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124204/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing15.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124204/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing15-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124204/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing15-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124204/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing15-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124204/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing15-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124221/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing22.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124221/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing22.jpg\" alt=\"Bikepacking Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 \" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124221/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing22.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124221/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing22-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124221/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing22-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124221/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing22-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124221/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing22-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124223/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing23.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124223/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing23.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 bikepacking adventures\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124223/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing23.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124223/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing23-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124223/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing23-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124223/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing23-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124223/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing23-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>This particular trip took us up to Michigan where we found mostly deserted gravel and sand roads, a bit of single track, and a route that was fun for the whole crew. Bikepacking can be intimidating, especially for beginners. But with each trip you get better at packing, making do with less, and generally just enjoying the moment. It’s definitely something I need more of in my life, which is why we’re already making plans for 2022.</p><h2>Mountain Bike</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124230/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing26.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124230/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing26.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 revel ranger\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124230/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing26.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124230/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing26-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124230/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing26-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124230/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing26-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124230/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing26-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Revel Ranger</strong></p><p>If you read my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-awards-2020-zachs-best-bikes-gear-picks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EC post for 2020</a>, you know that the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/long-term-review-revel-ranger-is-like-the-rascal-only-smaller-and-w-more-tire-clearance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revel Ranger</a> was already an Honorable Mention.

We had just had a baby, the world was in the middle of a pandemic, and we were getting ready to move. Ultimately, I just didn’t feel like I had gotten an honest impression of the bike yet.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 revel ranger\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10000529/Revel-Ranger-XC-downcountry-trail-mountain-bike-review-2021-Bikerumor-2-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>So I hung it up over the winter and checked back in during the spring. It was then that I really started to understand the Ranger. Unlike many ‘downcountry’ bikes, the Ranger doesn’t feel like it’s just a stretched-out XC rig with more travel. Instead, it feels like a truly capable trail or even light enduro bike, just in a compact package that really likes to climb. It honestly made my Revel Rascal (which I bought a few years ago) feel a bit redundant.</p><p>Long story short, I’m glad Revel let me keep the Ranger for so long. And even though I did eventually send it back, it was a hard one to let go.</p><h2>Road &amp; Gravel Bikes</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 Specialized Aethos\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice-120x68.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice-768x432.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08125008/Specialized-Aethos-frameset-2021-editors-choice-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Specialized Aethos Frameset</strong></p><p>Without a bit of dumb luck, I wouldn’t have even gotten to ride the Specialized Aethos this year. Which would have been terrible, because it’s really, really good. When tasked with finding a frameset to build up for the Shimano Dura-Ace launch (see below), Specialized ended up being one of the only companies with a frameset that would fit me.

Photo c. Shimano</p></div><p>Thanks to the lack of proprietary parts and fitments, it was an easy task for the frame to be built up with the latest components from Shimano and PRO. The resulting silhouette is a true modern classic with minimal branding and great paint.

But not great. The new Wicked Will challenges that notion, with a truly all-purpose trail tread design. OK, they’re no replacement for studded fat bike tires in the winter, but within reason, the new tread design is hard to beat. From <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-wicked-will-returns-as-the-ideal-all-purpose-trail-tire-for-unlimited-performance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the moment I mounted these up in early spring</a>, all the way to late-fall leaf surfing, the Wicked Will was up to the task. All while remaining incredibly fast-rolling, and sure-footed in the corners.</p><p>It’s also impressively light at 816g for a 29 x 2.4″ tire in the Super Race skinwall casing. And at the end of a full season, the tread is showing very little signs of wear. The tires never quite reached their 2.4″ potential at 2.35″ on a 30mm internal rim, but I’ll gladly give up 0.05″ for this level of performance.</p><h2>Drivetrain</h2><div id=\"attachment_270021\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/31154814/Specialized-Aethos-dura-ace-9200-review-build-Photos-c-Shimano-4.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-270021\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/31154814/Specialized-Aethos-dura-ace-9200-review-build-Photos-c-Shimano-4.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 Shimano Dura Ace 9200 12 speed\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/31154814/Specialized-Aethos-dura-ace-9200-review-build-Photos-c-Shimano-4.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/31154814/Specialized-Aethos-dura-ace-9200-review-build-Photos-c-Shimano-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/31154814/Specialized-Aethos-dura-ace-9200-review-build-Photos-c-Shimano-4-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/31154814/Specialized-Aethos-dura-ace-9200-review-build-Photos-c-Shimano-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/31154814/Specialized-Aethos-dura-ace-9200-review-build-Photos-c-Shimano-4-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-270021\">Photo c.

For me, the jersey material handles our oppressively humid summers better than most, and the material has proven to be quite durable—though each piece includes its own repair kit just in case.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124238/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing29.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124238/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing29.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 MAAP ALT_Road\" width=\"900\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124238/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing29.jpg 900w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124238/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing29-225x300.jpg 225w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124238/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing29-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124238/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing29-90x120.jpg 90w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124238/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing29-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: MAAP ALT_Road</strong></p><p>Initially, I wasn’t sure I even wanted to test out the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/maap-alt_road-collection-helps-take-the-road-less-traveled-w-durable-modular-apparel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ALT_Road collection from MAAP</a>.

Just plan on sizing up—I typically wear a 30/30 in most pants, and the 30s of these were&nbsp;<em>way</em> too small.

It’s made from Gore-Tex Paclite Plus so it’s durable, waterproof, windproof, and can be packed down into its own pocket. That means it takes up little space in your bag, and weighs in at 295g for a medium. The hood fits over a helmet for those days where it’s pouring but you have to keep pedaling, there’s velcro cuffs and a drawcord at the hem to keep out the elements, and there are two front zippered pockets so you can store things, warm up your hands, etc.</p><p>Just know that Gore Wear updated their sizes, and you’ll probably want to size down if you’ve had one of their jackets in the past.

There are other racks that are full suspension compatible, but what I love about the Aeropack system is that it makes it possible to ride trails unencumbered once you’ve bikepacked to your destination. Just load up your gear for the weekend, ride to a destination mountain bike trail, and in seconds, you’ve completely removed the rack and gear from your bike. Then, you can set up camp and go ride the mountain bike trails as they were intended. When it’s time to go home, the rack snaps back on in seconds, and you can hit the road.</p><p>There’s so much to the system that you’ll have to read it in the full review.

That’s mostly because it’s technically three separate pieces held together by magnets. That makes it far easier to use individual tools when you don’t have to fan it out from 37 other attachments on a Swiss Army-style multi-tool.</p><p>It’s reassuring knowing that short of a pump, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-components-8-bit-system-expands-with-magnetic-stacking-multi-tool-mini-utility-knife/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8-Bit system</a> has most of what you need in one easy-to-grab and stash package for your next ride—tubeless plugger (which has already saved the day), chain tool with spare master links, tire lever, rim wrench, multiple bits, even a retractable utility blade. I’d like to see a bit extension for hard-to-reach bolts and stronger magnets to hold the tools together, but those are small critiques for what is otherwise a very well-thought-out kit.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124157/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124157/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing12.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 Topeak Ninja Master+ SK side mount bottle cage \" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124157/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing12.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124157/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing12-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124157/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing12-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124157/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing12-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124157/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing12-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Topeak Ninja Master+ Cage SK</strong></p><p>Water bottle cages are a dime a dozen, but the Topeak Ninja Master+ is very well designed and inexpensive. The side-access cage includes a moveable bottom ‘tab’ which allows the cage to be mounted for access from the right or the left side of the bike, depending on which end you mount the tab. This makes it very useful for full suspension frames with tight spaces for water bottles, or any frame with limited space for that matter (like my bikepacking set on the Otso, though not without some help from the WTC B-RAD base).

I’ve used this feature a lot while exploring new terrain.</p><p>Finally, pairing other sensors is incredibly easy. I paired a heart rate sensor the other day as I was pedaling along without stopping. Once it paired, it even added a heart rate field in the display which included a color-coded background based on my HR zones automatically.

For a cooler that is designed to stay cold for 36h, it’s surprisingly light while feeling like you could run it over and it would survive.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124150/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing9.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124150/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing9.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 Silky Pocketboy saw\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124150/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing9.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124150/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing9-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124150/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing9-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124150/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing9-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124150/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing9-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124152/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124152/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing10.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 Silky Pocketboy 170mm review\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124152/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing10.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124152/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing10-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124152/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing10-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124152/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing10-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08124152/Bikerumor-editors-choice-2021-zach-bikepacking-mountain-bike-tools-cycling-clothing10-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Silky Pocketboy 170 Folding Saw</strong></p><p>I’ve been wanting a trail saw that was more durable and portable enough to stick in a pocket—the <a href=\"https://silkysaws.com/silky-pocketboy-170mm-folding-saw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Silky Pocketboy 170mm</a> is that saw. Not only does it include a slick plastic case that will keep the teeth from catching on your jersey/bib/short material for easy removal, but it features an all-metal construction for the locking mechanism where many competitors use plastic. If you’re like me and often use your trail saw more as a machete to clear gnarly thorn branches that stretch across the trail, that metal construction will keep your saw from breaking. This saw has very sharp teeth, great ergonomics, and weighs in at 290g.</p><h2>Nutrition</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08132945/Honey-stinger-waffle-cookies-cream.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08132945/Honey-stinger-waffle-cookies-cream.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Editor's Choice Awards 2021 Honey Stinger cooking and cream waffles\" width=\"584\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08132945/Honey-stinger-waffle-cookies-cream.jpg 584w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08132945/Honey-stinger-waffle-cookies-cream-297x283.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/08132945/Honey-stinger-waffle-cookies-cream-120x114.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Honey Stinger Cookies &amp; cream waffles</strong></p><p>This is an easy one.

So good.</p><p><em>Many more great products have passed through our hands this year, but this collection highlights the best I’ve seen or ridden. Full disclosure: Each of these products has been chosen purely on their performance and/or technological merits for the reasons described above. Under no circumstances were any of our selections paid for by their producers. Nor was any preference or favor given to advertisers or brands who bring us on trips. Our selections are for the most part (but not exclusively) limited to products that we’ve actually spent time riding/testing in person. So, a brand’s willingness to invite Bikerumor to join a launch event, or to provide product samples, does make it more likely that we will have considered their products simply because we’ve had a chance to try them first hand.</em></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e8b41cd28feb44bad80b53e33021027c4837fc9210e0a8513ce07c8565d2f9e4","category":"Cycling"}
