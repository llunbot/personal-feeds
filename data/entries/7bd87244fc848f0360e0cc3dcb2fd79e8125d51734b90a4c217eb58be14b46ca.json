I think among cyclists, and mountain bikers specifically, we all know there are some amazing places to ride your bike in North Carolina. Tsali, Pisgah, DuPont, Brevard, Boone, Asheville… all immediately pop into mind. But there are so many more great places to ride. After all, Bikerumor was founded in Greensboro, NC back in 2008. We’ve been riding all kinds of bikes, all over the state, for decades since.<br /> <br />Let’s face it: sometimes even pedals need a pause. Thankfully, our friends at <a href=\"https://visitnc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visit NC</a> are here to remind us of the many other incredible ways to <a href=\"https://outdoornc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">enjoy the outdoors</a> across the state. So take a breather, call it a rest day, or whatever fits your fancy. It’s time to explore some of North Carolina’s best cross-training adventures — from the mountains to the coast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meet the Big-Wave Surfer Who Calls North Carolina Home</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From Jaws to Mavericks, professional surfer Mason Barnes rides some of the world’s biggest waves</strong>. Still, nothing beats catching the warm, familiar waves of his hometown in <a href=\"https://www.visitnc.com/story/HRRN/must-do-activities-for-an-exceptional-wrightsville-beach-spring-getaway\" target=\"_blank\">Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina</a>. “The happiest I’ll ever be in my entire life is right here in my backyard,” Barnes says. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barnes credits these North Carolina surf town roots with shaping his entire path. “I didn’t surf big waves for the first time here, but this is where I fell in love with the sport,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Barnes, the stretch of coastline around Wrightsville Beach will forever be an anchor — part launchpad, part sanctuary, always home. When the swell’s up, Barnes is off to <a href=\"https://www.wilmingtonandbeaches.com/listing/masonboro-island-reserve/823/\" target=\"_blank\">Masonboro Island Reserve</a>, a local escape with some of the <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/boats-water/surfing/surfing-north-carolina\">best waves on the East Coast</a> and a view that feels almost mythical. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Surfing-Wrightsville-Beach-with-Mason-Barnes.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Surfing-Wrightsville-Beach-with-Mason-Barnes.webp\" alt=\"Surfing-Wrightsville-Beach-with-Mason-Barnes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Surfing-Wrightsville-Beach-with-Mason-Barnes.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Surfing-Wrightsville-Beach-with-Mason-Barnes-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Surfing-Wrightsville-Beach-with-Mason-Barnes-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Surfing-Wrightsville-Beach-with-Mason-Barnes-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/GearJunkie)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Surfing isn’t the only thing that keeps Barnes hooked on Wrightsville Beach. The small-town vibe also plays a big part in making this place feel like home. Between surf sessions, he stops for a bite at locally owned <a href=\"https://loveysmarket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lovey’s</a> Market — where he’s been ordering the same quesadilla for over 15 years — or grabs a healthy snack from <a href=\"https://bevvy-mart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bevvy Mart</a> just steps from the shore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bvgvJPd2Q\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the video</a> to learn why the North Carolina surf scene will always be number one for Barnes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p><em>This video and story was sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.visitnc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visit NC</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/big-wave-surfer-north-carolina-home/\">Side Quest: Exploring North Carolina’s Coast When You’re Off the Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Staff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7bd87244fc848f0360e0cc3dcb2fd79e8125d51734b90a4c217eb58be14b46ca","category":"Cycling"}
