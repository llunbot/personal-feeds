After observing a radio receiver on the streetlight poles throughout Berlin, they got to wondering: Would it be possible for someone with a central transmitter to control them en masse, and if so, could they create a city-wide light installation along the lines of <a href=\"http://blinkenlights.net/\">Project Blinkenlights</a>?</p>\n<img width=\"1500\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/project-blinkenlights-throughout-the-years.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/project-blinkenlights-throughout-the-years.jpg 1500w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/project-blinkenlights-throughout-the-years-640x198.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/project-blinkenlights-throughout-the-years-1024x317.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/project-blinkenlights-throughout-the-years-768x238.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/project-blinkenlights-throughout-the-years-980x304.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/project-blinkenlights-throughout-the-years-1440x446.jpg 1440w\" />\n      Images showing Project Blinkenlights throughout the years.\n        Credit:\n          Positive Security\n      \n<p>The first Project Blinkenlights iteration occurred in 2001 in Berlin, when the lights inside a large building were synchronized to turn on and off to give the appearance of a giant, low-resolution monochrome computer screen.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/could-hackers-use-new-attack-to-take-down-european-power-grid/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/could-hackers-use-new-attack-to-take-down-european-power-grid/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"716b46e2337bbf6a75b061ec374a26f17604cf7bfb91fbfe6521a853cd46d03c","category":"Tech"}
