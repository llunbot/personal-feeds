The Ray-Ban Stories are <a href=\"https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/c/discover-ray-ban-stories/clp\">priced starting at $299</a> and come in 20 style combinations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ray-ban-stories.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSmart glasses might suggest augmented reality capabilities, but Facebook's Ray-Ban Stories are similar to other connected sunglasses on the market and are limited to making phone calls, snapping photos, and listening to music.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ray-Ban Stories are equipped with a set of 5-megapixel cameras built into each side of the frame, which can record photos and 30-second videos using a button or hands-free with the Facebook Assistant.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a hard-wired LED light that comes on whenever you're taking a photo or a video so other people aren't caught unaware.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ray-ban-stories-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor listening to music, the Ray-Ban Stories have open-ear speakers, and there's a three microphone array for calls. The Ray-Ban Stories have a built-in battery that lasts for up to six hours and a portable charging case, which Facebook claims will provide up to three consecutive days of glasses use, but some reviewers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436003308531949571\">have said</a> that the battery drains quickly if the glasses aren't turned off while not in use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook's smart glasses work with the Facebook View app, which is designed to allow users to share point of view stories, photos, and more on social media. According to Facebook, the app is designed to make it easy to share content on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Twitter, TikTok, and Snapchat.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Today we’re excited to launch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ray_ban?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ray_ban</a> Stories built with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Luxottica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Luxottica</a>: Smart glasses that let you capture photos and video, share your adventures, and listen to music or take phone calls — so you can stay present with the world around you. // <a href=\"https://t.co/bwwTXaM9WI\">https://t.co/bwwTXaM9WI</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TnV0Vb60RW\">pic.twitter.com/TnV0Vb60RW</a></p>— Tech@Facebook (@techatfacebook) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techatfacebook/status/1435997865277460485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ray-Ban Stories come in several iconic Ray-Ban styles like Wayfarer, and there are five color options.
