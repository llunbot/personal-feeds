According to the latter report, Apple is planning to launch an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/\">all-new thinner iPhone 17</a> model next year that will allegedly feature a \"major redesign\" akin to the iPhone X.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/\">reported</a> that Apple is planning a complete revamp of the Apple Watch for the device's tenth anniversary, dubbed \"Apple Watch X.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the original Apple Watch was unveiled in 2014 and launched in 2015, Gurman is unsure whether the ‌Apple Watch X‌ will be released in 2024 or 2025. However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/\">claimed</a> that this year's upcoming Apple Watch will have a larger screen and thinner design, which sounds like the sort of major overhaul and design signature that Gurman has suggested.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2021, Apple significantly redesigned the MacBook Pro, making it thicker and heavier. A major highlight of the redesign was the reintroduction of several ports that were removed in previous iterations in favor of chassis thinness. MacBook Pro models now include an HDMI port, an SD card slot, MagSafe 3 charging port, three Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, and a headphone jack. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/\">Apple Developing Thinner MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, and iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-developing-thinner-macbook-pro-apple-watch-and-iphone.2429400/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8de4248ebed2248320c1a81cbf13ef8bd18a8e84054e4f8665bf7302c164befd","category":"Apple"}
