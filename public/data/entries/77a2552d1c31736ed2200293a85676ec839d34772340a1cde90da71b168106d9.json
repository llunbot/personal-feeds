The backdoor also enables attackers to funnel data from other servers through the router, turning the device into a covert proxy for concealing the true origin of malicious activity.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure5.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure5-640x393.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure5.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure5.png\"></a> (credit: Black Lotus Labs)</p></div>\n<p>“This type of agent demonstrates that anyone with a router who uses the Internet can potentially be a target—and they can be used as proxy for another campaign—even if the entity that owns the router does not view themselves as an intelligence target,” researchers from security firm Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs <a href=\"https://blog.lumen.com/new-hiatusrat-router-malware-covertly-spies-on-victims/\">wrote</a>. “We suspect that threat actors are going to continue to utilize multiple compromised assets in conjunction with one another to avoid detection.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922180#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922180&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77a2552d1c31736ed2200293a85676ec839d34772340a1cde90da71b168106d9","category":"Tech"}
