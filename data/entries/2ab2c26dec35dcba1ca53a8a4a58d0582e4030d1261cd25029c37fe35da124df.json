While <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/yet-another-hurricane-wetter-windier-and-more-destructive-because-of-climate-change/\">the analysis</a> is limited by the fact that not all the meteorological data is even available yet, by several measures, climate change made aspects of Milton significantly more likely.</p>\n<p>This isn't a huge surprise, given that Milton traveled across the same exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/helenes-carolina-rainfall-made-70-percent-more-likely-by-climate-change/\">Helene had recently transited</a>. But the analysis does produce one striking result: Milton would have been a Category 2 storm at landfall if climate change weren't boosting its strength.</p>\n<h2>From the oceans to the skies</h2>\n<p>Hurricanes strengthen while over warm ocean waters, and climate change has been slowly cranking up the heat content of the oceans. But it's important to recognize that the slow warming is an average, and that can include some <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/ocean-heat-waves-remake-pacific-and-caribbean-habitats/\">localized extreme events</a>. This year has seen <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/what-you-need-to-know-about-record-breaking-heat-in-the-atlantic/\">lots of ocean temperature records set</a> in the Atlantic basin, and that seems to be true in the Gulf of Mexico as well. The researchers note that a different rapid analysis released earlier this week showed that the ocean temperatures—which had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/hurricane-milton-becomes-second-fastest-storm-to-reach-category-5-status/\">boosted Milton to a Category 5 storm</a> during its time in the Gulf—were <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-shift-index-alert/hurricane-milton-october-2024\">between 400 and 800 times more likely</a> to exist thanks to climate change.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2ab2c26dec35dcba1ca53a8a4a58d0582e4030d1261cd25029c37fe35da124df","category":"Tech"}
