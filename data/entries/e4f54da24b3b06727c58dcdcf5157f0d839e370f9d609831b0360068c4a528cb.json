These new bearings use ceramic Silicon Nitride balls, which are multiple times harder than steel and will not corrode.</p>\n<p>Like existing 11O headsets, Cane Creek covers this new headset under their 11O Guarantee, promising to replace any part if the rider finds dissatisfaction with it – for as long as they own it. Cane Creek 11Os are the only headsets on the market for which all parts, including bearings, are satisfaction-guaranteed for life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Cane_Creek_110_Ceramic_Headset-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Cane_Creek_110_Ceramic_Headset-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Cane_Creek_110_Ceramic_Headset-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Cane_Creek_110_Ceramic_Headset-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The 11O Ceramic features an eye-catching, dual-stage anodized cup and cover design as well as tighter, more robust weather sealing than the Fifty.
