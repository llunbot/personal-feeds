Case in point: This week, a fire chief in rural Alabama <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/fire-chief-shot-deer-alabama.html\">stopped to help a driver who had just hit a deer</a>. The two men walked up the driveway of a nearby home. For reasons that remain unclear, a man came out of the house with a gun and started shooting. This was a bad idea on many levels, but most practically because <em>both the fire chief and the driver were also armed</em>. Between the three of them, everyone got shot, the fire chief died, and the man who lived in the home was charged with murder.</p>\n<p>But despite the ease of acquiring legal weapons, a robust black market still exists to traffic in things like \"ghost guns\" (no serial numbers) and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdok/media/1366621/dl?inline\">machine gun converters</a> (which make a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic). According to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-atfs-publication-final-volume-national-firearms-commerce-and\">major new report</a> released this month by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, there was a 1,600 percent increase in the use of privately made \"ghost guns\" during crimes between 2017 and 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, the seizure of machine gun converters also increased by 784 percent.</p>\n<p>Ars Technica has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/with-founder-out-on-bail-whats-next-for-3d-gun-printer-defense-distributed/\">covered these issues for years</a>, since both \"ghost guns\" and machine gun converters can be produced using 3D-printed parts, the schematics for which are now widely available online. But you can know about an issue and still be surprised when local prosecutors start talking about black market trafficking rings, inept burglary schemes, murder—and 3D printing operations being run out of a local apartment.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/3d-printed-ghost-gun-ring-comes-to-my-community-and-leaves-a-man-dead/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/3d-printed-ghost-gun-ring-comes-to-my-community-and-leaves-a-man-dead/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e3f6fb5022e5e11059f3fbf9a2b994d0dd4b6250adf7bb95a25c9d59ba0aadf","category":"Tech"}
