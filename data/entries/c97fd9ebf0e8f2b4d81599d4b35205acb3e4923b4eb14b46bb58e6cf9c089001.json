The most interesting aspect of the update for retro computing enthusiasts is expanded operating system support: the app will now run on Windows 95, Windows 98, and old versions of Windows NT like 3.51 and 4.0. The previous version of the app only went as far back as Windows XP.</p>\n<p>The app spits out benchmarking scores for five things: single-core CPU performance, multi-core CPU performance, 2D graphics performance using GDI, 3D graphics performance using OpenGL, and disk speed (broken into four sub-benchmarks for sequential and random read and write performance).</p>\n<p>The app will also run on current systems, including 64-bit x86 and Arm-based PCs, and the results database is dominated by those modern systems. But searching by operating system allows you to zero in on those retro results, including nine (as of this writing) <a href=\"https://crystalmarkdb.com/retro?date=&amp;os_name=Windows+95&amp;display_size=&amp;keyword=\">for Windows 95</a>, six for <a href=\"https://crystalmarkdb.com/retro?date=&amp;os_name=Windows+98&amp;display_size=&amp;keyword=\">Windows 98</a>, and five for <a href=\"https://crystalmarkdb.com/retro?date=&amp;os_name=Windows+NT+3.51&amp;display_size=&amp;keyword=\">Windows NT 3.51</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/crystalmark-retro-benchmark-extends-support-all-the-way-back-to-windows-95/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/crystalmark-retro-benchmark-extends-support-all-the-way-back-to-windows-95/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c97fd9ebf0e8f2b4d81599d4b35205acb3e4923b4eb14b46bb58e6cf9c089001","category":"Tech"}
