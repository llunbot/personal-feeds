To my 17 year old eyes, the bike wasn’t missing this or that, it simply existed in its pure state.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0297.jpeg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>So when a few of my best friends pitched the idea of bike touring 230 miles from the Canada-Vermont border all the way south to the Vermont-Massachusetts line to celebrate graduation, it was of course the Lotus that got the call. To no one’s surprise, I friction shifted, side-pull braked, and pannier-toted myself the entire length of the Green Mountain state without any trace of an issue. This was my first taste of self-supported bicycle touring, and it was a critical moment in my life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0295.jpeg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Over the next four years, my desire to spend time on the Lotus waned as I went to college, fell in love with mountain biking, got a lightweight road bike, and began to focus more on what this 30+ year old bike lacked, rather than what it provided. As a result, it spent lots of time locked up outside in the unforgiving Vermont seasons, its rusted chain and now seized bottom bracket and stem protesting with every ride to and from class. During this time, I began volunteering at our local bike non-profit, Old Spokes Home, to which I eventually donated the Lotus. Due to its rough condition, it sat in the basement of the community shop for the better part of two years, patiently awaiting what would become its second phase of life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024,1366&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?resize=768,1024&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?resize=1800,2400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?resize=1335,1780&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?resize=700,933&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152,1536&amp;quality=75 1152w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7582-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536,2048&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024,1366&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?resize=768,1024&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?resize=1800,2400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?resize=1335,1780&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?resize=700,933&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152,1536&amp;quality=75 1152w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7587-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536,2048&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,1366&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?resize=768,1024&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,2400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1780&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?resize=700,933&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?resize=1152,1536&amp;quality=75 1152w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_7592-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,2048&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>After graduation, armed with a degree I have yet to use and a new appreciation for the vintage bicycle, plus a full time job at Old Spokes, I reclaimed the Lotus from that brick basement with a vision of a single speed gravel bike.

The quill stem had become one with the steer tube, but a sawzall fairly quickly rectified that.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1955\" height=\"1303\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?w=1955&amp;quality=75 1955w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8897.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I knew the seized bottom bracket outmatched me, so when I asked my dear friend, former co worker, and general wizard of the greater Burlington area, Rob (and his acetylene torch), for help, he offered to braze on canti posts in an effort to help the frame realize its gravel riding potential.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
