Scorching temperatures in the south of Spain were followed by foggy deluges in the north. While this presented problems for the riders, it also made life harder for the photographers trying to capture the action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s horrific,’ says photographer Chris Auld. ‘You think, “Oh, this is going to be great – the fog’s going to look amazing.” But really, you’ve got no view and it’s the worst possible scenario. Then you’ve got to somehow edit the pictures.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Auld knows his business, having worked on WorldTour races since 2017 and covered five Vueltas. While it can be a solitary pursuit at times, if things go awry the informal alliances that form between colleagues can be invaluable.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grand-tour-2025-route-rumours\">Grand Tour 2025 route rumours: What we know so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-reflections\">Vuelta a España 2024 reflections: Primož Roglič victorious, Australia’s champions, Equipo Kern Pharma and Max Poole shine</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Vuelta a España 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘We share transport and accommodation to keep costs down and we’ll share pictures as well,’ says Auld. ‘So if you’ve missed something your clients need, someone else can sort you out. It gives clients more bang for their buck, since we can cover different angles and more of the race.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any professional group, there are hierarchies: ‘You’ve got day photographers in their coloured bibs who are lower in the pecking order than the full-timers or whole race photographers. And then the guys on the motos get priority over everyone. That’s just how it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve been around a while so my colleagues will let me get a spot on the railings when I need it. You get guys turning up at the finish line of the final stage who don’t know about the hierarchy and try to muscle in. Suffice to say we soon let them know how it works.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you do finally get the spot you need, the next challenge is getting the right angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m desperately just trying to get rid of all the horrible advertising signage in the background, while the race organisers are doing everything in their power to get it in. If we shoot it without advertising it’s better for us. It’s cleaner, it’s nicer, and it’s available to other brands that don’t want images containing rival logos.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-970x327.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-970x327.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-300x101.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-768x259.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-1536x517.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-2048x689.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-750x252.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-4-1140x384.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Tour de France, which keeps everyone at an unrelenting pitch of mild panic for the whole three weeks, the Vuelta is calmer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Vuelta bosses are cagey about the information they will give you. They might say, “You can’t access this climb after 3.30pm, even if you’ve got your official sticker.” I absolutely had to get the climb shot for my client so I couldn’t take the risk and went straight there. Lo and behold, my colleagues shot the rest of the race, rocked up after 3.30 and drove straight through.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was insane when the Tour started in the Basque Country last year, but at the Vuelta the crowds were smaller. The Spanish fans are pretty respectful and you don’t get those walls of people that you get at the Tour. It’s easier to cover.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still plenty of rules for photographers to follow, however, and dealing with bureaucracy is a constant challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Driving is another challenge, although easier than in France: ‘Instead of closed roads, the Vuelta uses rolling roadblocks. That means we can drive towards the race instead of away from it, which gives us more flexibility and the chance to make more shots. You find the race, stop, shoot, and then hop back in the car. If they do a loop, it means you will see them twice and get two shots, whereas at the Tour, if you’re behind the race, that’s it, you’re finished.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This does have its downsides, though: ‘The Granada stage had a really short loop, so we tried to get them on the climb twice. Unfortunately the broom wagon riders were going so slow that it looked like the lead vehicles were going to catch the back of the race. I was in one of the last cars behind the race – police coming past – and the road was getting so narrow and tight.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for those extreme temperatures, Auld thinks starting the stages earlier might be the answer: ‘At 5pm it was still over 40°C on some stages and yet they’re starting the races at the hottest time of day.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An earlier start would also help with the photographer’s diet: ‘We get back to the press room at 9pm, at which point you start your three hours of editing. It’s why you spend so much time at McDonald’s on a Grand Tour.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 2024 Vuelta a España in photos</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Main image: </strong>‘This is early in the race when I still had some enthusiasm for sign-on. Eventually I gave up going to them because they’re the same every day and clients stop using the images too.

On the Picón Blanco climb I got as low as I could to take this photograph, and I like the way the fans being on an upper bank above the riders gives it a nice, enclosed atmosphere.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grand-tour-2025-route-rumours\">Grand Tour 2025 route rumours: What we know so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-reflections\">Vuelta a España 2024 reflections: Primož Roglič victorious, Australia’s champions, Equipo Kern Pharma and Max Poole shine</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Vuelta a España 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2024-vuelta-a-espana-photos\">Behind the scenes at the Vuelta a España with pro photographer Chris Auld</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0c63e5755c8112b9240e8b49dbebd25ed13d6902dd5a521fd8a3c221a0049a0a","category":"Cycling"}
