In addition to the actual shipping, we’ve also come to know Bikeflights for their shipping boxes. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikeflights-builds-a-better-bike-box-with-super-strong-reusable-cardboard-bbm-bbl/\" target=\"_blank\">These are no ordinary bike boxes</a> though, and thanks to some new features, Bikeflights is updating its most popular box. Meet the new and improved Bikeflights Bike Box Large (BBL).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The significant upgrades will make the box easier to pack, sturdier, and more recyclable. “<em>We leveraged customer and partner feedback along with our experience shipping millions of bikes all over the world to make the Bikeflights Bike Box Large (BBL) even better</em>,” said Bikeflights President William Alcorn. “<em>We reviewed every detail of our box and figured out what we could change to improve our customers’ experience of packing and shipping bikes</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s New?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bikeflights-New-Bike-Box-first-pic.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bikeflights-New-Bike-Box-first-pic.webp\" alt=\"Bikeflights New Bike Box first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bikeflights-New-Bike-Box-first-pic.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bikeflights-New-Bike-Box-first-pic-297x89.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bikeflights-New-Bike-Box-first-pic-120x36.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bikeflights-New-Bike-Box-first-pic-768x230.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Bikeflights)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikeflights says that packing a bike into the latest version of the BBL will only take a few minutes, as it requires very little bike disassembly. Not to mention that every part of the bike has its own designated spot within the box. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new rear wheel slot will help guide the bike into position within the box. The patented dropout spacer secures the bike’s fork in place. Then, there is the new protective wheel sleeve that holds the front wheel in place while keeping it away from contact with the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the small parts, like nuts, rotors, and removed accessories have a place of their own within the box, in the included small parts bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring 64x14x32 inches (163x36x82 centimeters),  the new BBL is 2″ longer than the prior version and will fit longer bikes and eBikes. Key areas of the box are more robust and upgraded to cardboard that offers 35% more board strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new BBL also has stronger handholds that are less likely to tear. New recessed, push-and-turn lid fasteners eliminate the need for tape to seal the box shut. The new box is more recyclable as well eliminating 100% of the foam packing materials that came with the previous model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new BBL has graphics on it that instructs riders about packing tips and indicates where to apply shipping labels, ensuring they are more likely to stay in pace during shipping. There are also familiar messaging icons to encourage safer handling of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retail and Video Gallery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikeflights Bike Box Large Retail: $99.95 (plus shipping to the customer, which is calculated at checkout)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unboxing the New BBL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Assemble the New BBL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Pack Road, Gravel, or Cross Bikes in the New BBL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Pack an MTB in the New BBL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.bikeflights.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BikeFlights.com</a></em><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikeflights-bike-box-large-shipping-boxes/\">Bikeflights’ $100 BBL Raises Bike Shipping Boxes to the Next Level</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"10e169fe4582bcd04712d09d4a680828a33f19949555f6963a7f9d8da86fcdfb","category":"Cycling"}
