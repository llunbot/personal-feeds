They look like iPhones. The non-Pro models have their cameras aligned vertically rather than diagonally. There’s a pink one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaway is that Apple will differentiate the Pro models with slightly larger screens, as has been rumored. It’s hard to say for sure, but in the image, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max appear to be slightly larger than the companion iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, but it’s hard to say for sure. Apple is sure to create some extra screen space by shrinking the bezels as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He followed up the post with a closer image of the pink iPhone 16, which gives a better look at the cameras. Apple has shrunken the camera array on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to be a small oval rather than the large square from the previous generations. The cameras are also arranged vertically rather than diagonally.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 mockup close-up\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1276w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=1240%2C1240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 16 mockup close-up\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1276w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=1240%2C1240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>@SonnyDickson</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 16 mockup close-up\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1276w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iphone16-mockup-close.jpg?resize=1240%2C1240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>@SonnyDickson</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>@SonnyDickson</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s really all there is to it. If accurate, this shows that Apple has made a slight change to the way the cameras are laid out on the iPhone 16 (non-Pro) models. It’s definitely just a minor tweak to recent iPhone designs—there’s no Pixel-style “camera bar” or cameras flush with the rear of the phone’s body or anything else that would make a meaningful difference to the design or use of the iPhone. But it would be the first visual change to the iPhone cameras in several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you were hoping that Apple would overhaul the iPhone design this year, prepare yourself for disappointment. They still just look like iPhones.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0c84808eb96c4c419f72af9af3b2de94314c3aa492398909f4558997afc94d94","category":"Apple"}
