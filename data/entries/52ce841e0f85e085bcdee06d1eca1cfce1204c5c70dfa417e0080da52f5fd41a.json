The ideal shoe cover for you will depend on the conditions you’ll be riding in, of course, with lightweight and aerodynamic options that excel in cold and dry conditions, to burly, multi-layer styles that can keep your feet warm after they get wet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help sort through the myriad shoe cover options on the market, review author Bennett Shane tested a diverse selection of 13 of the best models on the market for months in the highly variable weather of the Pacific Northwest. Important factors like wind and weather protection, warmth, fit, comfort, and ease of getting them on and off were considered while testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top cycling shoe recommendations are listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are all worthy options in their own right.

Signature Rain Bootie</a></strong> is a lightweight shoe cover that performs well in milder temperatures and wet or dry conditions. Taped seams and a waterproof softshell polyester material keep rain, road spray, and wind out, while allowing any excess heat and moisture to be pulled away from the foot, maintaining a nice environment for your feet in temps ranging from 40°-55° F, depending on shoe and sock choice, as well as ride intensity. </p><p></p><p>In the low 50s, with lightweight race shoes and thick socks, the Signature Rain Bootie felt airy and light. In colder conditions, with a less-ventilated pair of shoes and thick wool socks, this combination provided a nice barrier against the cold. So, we consider the Signature Rain Bootie to be a versatile and adaptable option for riders living in a temperate winter climate. For really cold conditions, however, we feel there are better options.</p><p></p><p>Reflective triangular panels on the rear-facing heel and underside of the toe and a reflective stripe along the rear zipper lend visibility in low-light conditions. The subtle Velocio logo on the outside of the forefoot is also reflective, for added visibility from the side.</p><p></p><p>The patterning of the Velocio Signature Rain Bootie gives it a snug, sleek, and comfortable fit. There is zero rippling or rubbing of the material, ensuring excellent aerodynamics. The reverse-coil zipper in the rear is reinforced so it’s easy to pull open and shut and stays sealed against the elements. </p><p></p><p>Velocio is known and loved for making great kit, and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-rain-bootie\">Signature Rain Bootie</a></strong> is yet another example of a thoughtful design that is well-executed. It is not a deep winter shoe cover, instead, it’s a great versatile option that works well for the vast majority of fall, winter, and spring conditions that most riders will encounter. At $99, the Signature Rain Bootie doesn’t come cheap but will perform well and stand up to many seasons of frequent use.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-rain-bootie\">Check Price at Velocio</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Value Cycling Shoe Covers\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017AXNWJ0/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFizik Waterproof Winter Overshoe\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$70</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>164g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Neoprene + 3L waterproof/breathable fabric</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S – XL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1181\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe.jpeg 1181w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Overshoe-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Warm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Waterproof</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reflective front and side</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fair price for waterproof protection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Shorter cuff height</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Limited reflectives on rear</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017AXNWJ0/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Fizik Waterproof Winter Overshoe</a></strong> is a beautifully designed piece of kit. Its neoprene construction serves up excellent insulation and the fully seam-sealed design prevents rain and road spray from absorbing through the stitching. The pattern integrates an extended upper panel in a three-layer laminated fabric that is waterproof and breathable. Overall, the Fizik Waterproof Winter Overshoe works brilliantly across a wide range of winter conditions, from high 30s to low 50s F in wet or dry conditions.</p><p></p><p>The exterior of the three-layer fabric is also reflective for added visibility to oncoming motorists. The rear zipper is topped by a Velcro closure which provides an adjustable fit around the lower calf muscle to ensure that water and cold air are shut out as well as possible. The bottom sole is constructed of a burly and wear-resistant fabric, which extends onto the toe to ward off tears or abrasion from toe overlaps with the front tire. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Fizik Waterproof Winter Overshoe is snug and nicely articulated to the motion of pedaling, ensuring a smooth surface and compact profile with excellent aerodynamics. A YKK water-repellent zipper protects from moisture ingress and allows for easy entry and exit, and a wide reflective “Fi’zi:k” side logo adds more visibility and some bold styling to the otherwise stealthy look.</p><p></p><p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017AXNWJ0/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Fizik Waterproof Winter Overshoe</a></strong> sells for $70, and considering its excellent protection,

href=\"https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-pro2-overshoes-our-flagship-overshoe-like-nothing-else-pro2?variant=33016737005652\">Spatzwear Spatz Pro 2 Overshoes</a></strong> are like no other offering we tested. They certainly look serious, but that look belies their comfort and easy-to-wear design. </p><p></p><p>Using what Spatz calls “Aero-Armour” Neoprene, which is finished smooth to shed water, topped with Kevlar for abrasion resistance in key areas, and lined with warm Thermo fabric to trap air and wick away moisture, the Spatz Pro II succeeded in keeping not only our feet, but also ankles, calf muscles, and shins completely warm and dry during some nasty rides done sans fenders. The Pro 2 is heat-welded and features taped seams throughout. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the Pro 2, it seems like they could present an epic battle just getting them on. Surprisingly, these were some of the easiest shoe covers to get into that we’ve ever used. The Aero-Armour Neoprene is flexible, and the “step-in” design and sole closure of the Spatz Pro 2 means they take mere seconds to get on and fixed into place. </p><p></p><p>Out on the road, there was no binding, pulling, or unwanted pressure anywhere inside the Spatz Pro 2 Overshoe. While the extra mass is noticeable when holding them in hand, they do such a great job of keeping road spray and rainfall out while also wicking away any moisture buildup inside, that they feel light as air while riding. </p><p></p><p>After a 2+ hour test ride in a steady drizzle, the thermal lining was dry as a bone and the shoe’s knit upper was also dry, which speaks to how well the Spatz Pro 2 Overshoe fits. This is key because of its “step-in” design. Without such a tidy fit, a lot of water could have come in through the bottom and sides of the shoes. </p><p></p><p>While the look is indeed polarizing and the graphics may leave a bit to be desired, the triangular reflective panel in the calf muscle area should help motorists see you more easily in dark conditions. Just know that during group rides, you may have to explain why you’re wearing knee-high overshoes to curious observers. </p><p></p><p>At $125, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-pro2-overshoes-our-flagship-overshoe-like-nothing-else-pro2?variant=33016737005652\">Spatzwear Spatz Pro 2</a></strong> is an investment in being able to ride comfortably in cold and wet conditions. As such, they’re probably going to leave a bit of a gap for most riders, between the apocalyptic conditions in which they shine, and conditions that are mild enough to go without any shoe coverage at all. The Spatz Pro 2 is for cyclists who want to ride no matter the weather, and just want to ride longer and in more comfort, even on the worst days</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-pro2-overshoes-our-flagship-overshoe-like-nothing-else-pro2?variant=33016737005652\">Check Price at Spatzwear</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Cycling Shoe Covers For Deep Winter\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-estremo-shoe-cover\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCastelli Estremo Shoe Cover\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$170</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>196g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>GORE-TEX INFINIUM™ WINDSTOPPER® upper, Polartec Power Stretch Pro lining, Polyurethane sole</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No, highly water-resistant</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S – XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1816\" height=\"1211\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover.jpeg 1816w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Cover-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super warm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Rugged construction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sleek fit considering the warmth</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Too warm for mild conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-estremo-shoe-cover\">Estremo Shoe Cover</a></strong> from Castelli offers protection from extreme cold by way of a Gore-Tex Infinium Windstopper outer layer and Polartec Power Stretch Pro inner layer that wraps the feet in a luxurious haven of insulation. </p><p></p><p>With a claimed temperature range of 8° to 41° F, we had to test the Estremo Shoe Cover at night in order to ride in temps cold enough to warrant wearing them. Breathability, and therefore versatility are limited unless you suffer from hopelessly cold feet after a certain period of time, even in milder conditions. Typically though, the Estremo needs temps in the mid-40s F and lower to avoid feeling too warm. </p><p></p><p>The Gore-Tex Infinium material is not completely waterproof, but it does a good job of shedding moisture in damp conditions while providing enough insulation to keep the feet warm should they get a little wet. A YKK Aquaguard zipper helps make these burly shoe covers easy to get on and off and also seals out moisture from road spray and light rainfall. The sole is constructed of highly durable polyurethane that resists tearing and offers decent grip walking on hard surfaces. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Estremo Shoe Cover is snug without any binding, pulling, or unwanted pressure. For how much protection the Estremo offers, it still feels light and supple on the feet while pedaling. For logos, Castelli has thankfully opted to use a rubber medallion that is stitched into the upper material. Reflective stripes on the forefoot and heel add a little visibility in low-light conditions.</p><p></p><p>The cost of warm toes in sub-freezing temperatures is $170 in the case of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-estremo-shoe-cover\">Castelli Estremo Shoe Cover</a></strong>, which is more than many nice pairs of road shoes, and approaches the cost of some dedicated winter riding boots. Still, we feel they are worth the asking price for those seeking to keep the feet warm on bitterly cold days in the heart of winter.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-estremo-shoe-cover\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WRSZ4M1/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Cycling Shoe Covers For Comfort\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fassos-assosoires-gt-ultraz-winter-bootie\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAssos GT Ultraz Winter Booties\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$120</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>129g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>ThermoShell 3-layer softshell, PU-bonded membrane, dual-layer twinDeck construction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>0, I, II (36-39, 40-43, 44-47 EU)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"911\" height=\"607\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties.jpeg 911w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-GT-Ultraz-Winter-Booties-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Flexible material</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super-warm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not suitable for wet conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Could use some more reflectives for visibility</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Assos apparel and accessories are highly specialized, meaning that versatility isn’t always their strong suit. The <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fassos-assosoires-gt-ultraz-winter-bootie\">GT Ultraz Winter Booties</a></strong> are another example of this – a shoe cover that excels beyond all others tested in cold and dry conditions but doesn’t cope well with spray from wet roads. </p><p></p><p>Contrary to our expectations of a “winter bootie”, the Assos GT Ultraz Winter Booties are light and soft, with a small waffle pattern to the TwinDeck textile. After an initial test ride in very wet conditions, the GT Ultraz soaked through relatively quickly, but further testing in cool and dry(ish) conditions quickly turned our impressions around and we began to hold them in high regard for their ability to keep the feet warm and also not interfere with the pedal stroke at all. As long as water isn’t spraying all over the GT Ultraz, they are excellent. </p><p></p><p>So what makes the GT Ultraz Winter so impressive on cool dry days? Foremost is the fit, which stays snug and smooth around the shoe without any ripples or excessive bulk that can rub the crankarms or chainstays. Moving up from the foot, the cuff of the GT Ultraz is finished in a raw cut that lies completely flat against tights or leg warmers, called Zero Cuff by Assos. This feature is important because many fabric shoe covers have a thick stitched hem that can bunch up during the pedal stroke and create a distracting rubbing sensation around the lower shin and ankles. No such issues with the GT Ultraz, which is able to flex and accommodate the extension of the ankle. </p><p></p><p>This fit, flexibility, and low weight all result from the TwinDeck Textile developed by Assos. The TwinDeck textile is thicker in the forefoot, which is where the brunt of the elements is born. Around the ankle, the material gets thinner and that’s part of what makes the GT Ultraz lighter (129g/pair) than most shoe covers with similar insulating capabilities, and light enough that you really don’t notice them if they haven’t absorbed any water. The GT Ultraz offers impressive insulation from cold thanks to an ultra-soft fleece lining, and Assos clearly knows how to layer materials to create more warmth than bulk. </p><p></p><p>At $120 US, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fassos-assosoires-gt-ultraz-winter-bootie\">Assos <strong>GT Ultraz Winter Booties</strong></a> are a premium product with usefulness limited to dry winter days or days when moisture isn’t getting sprayed up from the road. If you’re a fair-weather rider or live somewhere with dry winters, the GT Ultraz might be the only shoe cover you need. For those who need wet weather protection as well, another pair of shoe covers would need to be added to the arsenal to complement the GT Ultraz.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fassos-assosoires-gt-ultraz-winter-bootie\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Cycling Shoe Covers For Durability\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fendura-road-overshoe-shoe-covers-black-s-e1270bk-3%2Fp1364348%3Fv%3D1363241\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEndura Road Overshoe\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$70</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>197g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smooth Neoprene</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Hi-Viz Yellow</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S – XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1995\" height=\"1330\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe.jpeg 1995w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoe-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Durable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Warm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fair price</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Neoprene maintains warmth when wet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Kinda heavy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not super breathable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Neoprene is a sure-fire choice of material for cycling shoe covers, and there may be no better example of this than the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fendura-road-overshoe-shoe-covers-black-s-e1270bk-3%2Fp1364348%3Fv%3D1363241\">Endura Road Overshoes</a></strong>. Designed and tested in Scotland, this shoe cover hasn’t changed much over the past decade or so, because Endura nailed it long ago, and if it ain’t broke…</p><p></p><p>A smooth outer face allows the Neoprene material of the Road Overshoes to shed water easily and insulate against wind. Neoprene also offers a decent amount of stretch to accommodate different shoe upper profiles and doesn’t ripple or flap at high speed. Neoprene also has an unsurpassed ability to keep things warm even when moisture is present. When we’re honest about whether it’s possible to keep water off our feet for a 4-hour ride in the rain, it’s pretty clear that keeping feet warm once they are a bit damp is actually a more essential demand, and on that the Road Overshoe delivers. </p><p></p><p>One important update to the Road Overshoe for 2023 is the new offset rear zipper, which improves pedaling comfort by moving the zipper away from the flex point behind the ankle, reducing the chance of it digging in. Reflective stripes on both sides of the zipper also add some much-needed low-light visibility. </p><p></p><p>One of our favorite aspects of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fendura-road-overshoe-shoe-covers-black-s-e1270bk-3%2Fp1364348%3Fv%3D1363241\">Endura Road Overshoe</a></strong> is the hard-wearing sole material that features aramid thread. This construction ensures that the Road Overshoe won’t disintegrate as quickly along the sole the way so many other shoe covers do. Not only is it sad and unsightly when this happens, but it also allows moisture to creep in more easily from below. These concerns are things of the past with the Endura Road Overshoe, which is $70 well-spent and can often be found for much less.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fendura-road-overshoe-shoe-covers-black-s-e1270bk-3%2Fp1364348%3Fv%3D1363241\">Check Price at Performance Bike</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FBKF1CD/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Cycling Toe Covers\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186H2XZI/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVeloToze Toe Covers\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$15</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>25g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>100% Latex Rubber</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Blue, Red, White, Pink, Viz Yellow, Viz Orange, Viz Green</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>One Size</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"978\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers.jpeg 978w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Velotoze-toe-covers-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Color options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No seams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Very basic but effective</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Can tear around the cleat</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Rubber material doesn't do well with sharp objects or abrasion</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Sometimes full shoe covers are just overkill, and their lack of easy packability can lead you into riding with bare shoes only to get very cold toes. The remedy for this is affordable, humble, and surprisingly effective toe covers. The <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186H2XZI/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">VeloToze Toe Cover</a></strong> – Road is a shockingly simple but effective rubber barrier that slips onto the front of your shoes and around the cleat, keeping wind, mist, and road spray from affecting your toes. </p><p></p><p>The latex rubber material is thin and flexible enough to operate BOA dials concealed beneath it. Once in place, the rubber grabs hard and doesn’t slide down the shoe at all. With white shoes, the white covers are basically invisible and keep you looking tidy. If you’re not into the Velotoze logo, however, we recommend resisting the urge to reverse the Toe Covers when wearing white shoes as the black printed logo can discolor white materials if it stays in contact with the shoe’s upper surface for a long enough time. </p><p></p><p>We, and many others, tend to just put these on in September and leave them on our shoes until the truly nasty winter weather arrives and do the same in the spring. They’re stretchy enough that putting shoes on with the toe covers on isn’t an issue, and it helps prevent tearing the rubber around the cleat opening while putting them on/taking them off repeatedly. If you want to take them off during a ride, it’s super easy to store them in a jersey pocket or storage container on your bike.</p><p></p><p>Given that they are made from latex rubber, than can be prone to tearing if they come into contact with sharp objects or are scraped on the pavement. Another thing to avoid is wadding these up after a ride when they are wet. The rubber tends to stick to itself and makes returning them to their original form a bit of a challenge. Again, it’s easiest to just leave them on your shoes until they don’t make sense for the day’s weather, then remove them gently and store them flat. </p><p></p><p>Regardless, at just $15, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186H2XZI/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">VeloToze Toe Covers</a></strong> are a great value, easy to use, and effective for those less-than-perfect days. At 25g per pair, they won’t slow you down at all and can keep you focused on your ride, instead of frigid toes.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186H2XZI/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best of the Rest</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Cycling Shoe Covers On A Tight Budget\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F890980%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-bike-socks-blackchili%3Fcolor%3DBLACK%2FCHILI%2520PEPPER\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShowers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Socks\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$40</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>70g /pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Crosspoint 3-layer construction: kint outer, Artex membrane, Coolmax lining</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black/Grey, Chili Pepper/Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S/M, M/L, L/XL, XL/XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2130\" height=\"1420\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks.jpeg 2130w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pass-Waterproof-Socks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Minimal construction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Maximal protection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No seams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Must make an incision for cleat</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Looks may not be for everyone</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Yes, you read that right. These are waterproof socks and something that many budget-oriented cyclists have been using for years. While not marketed as a shoe cover, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F890980%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-bike-socks-blackchili%3Fcolor%3DBLACK%2FCHILI%2520PEPPER\">Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Socks</a></strong> are a highly effective option when modified to work with road cycling cleats. You may have seen other knit shoe covers that work this way, by requiring an incision be made along the front end of the sole so that the material can spread out around the cleat. </p><p></p><p>The Crosspoint Waterproof Sock is similar, but unlike basic wool overshoes, sometimes called “Belgian Booties”, the Crosspoint Waterproof Sock features a three-layer construction comprised of a waterproof breathable Artex™ membrane sandwiched between a Coolmax FX moisture-wicking anti-bacterial lining and a stretchy and hydrophobic knit outer layer. So, while they are called “socks” and look like socks stretched over your cycling shoes (in a good way), the Crosspoint is packed with advanced materials that keep your feet so much more comfortable than most traditional knit overshoes ever could. </p><p></p><p>You’ll need to size up so they are big enough to stretch over your cycling shoes, but in the right size, the Crosspoint Waterproof Socks easily accommodate the full range of motion in your pedal stroke, with no binding, pulling, or unwanted pressure. Another benefit of the sock shape is that there are no zippers, Velcro, or stitched seams anywhere. Unlike many “step-in” style shoe covers that feature Velcro joining both sides together along the sole, the Crosspoint Sock completely covers the entire bottom of the foot, making it much warmer than its weight and flexibility would suggest. </p><p></p><p>To make sure the cleat hole is cut in the correct place, we recommend sliding the Crosspoint socks on over your road shoes with the cleats installed, and marking where the cleat is with a simple line down the middle. Then, simply make an incision along this line.

Comprised of a waterproof polyurethane stretch fabric with a fleece-lined interior, the Pioggia 4 excels not only in wet but also in cold and dry conditions.</p><p></p><p>The fit of the Pioggia 4 is snug but not as tight as some other shoe covers we tested. It is also available in 5 sizes, which provides a huge sizing range. So, it might be worthwhile to order two sizes to see which one fits better over your specific shoes and ankle. </p><p></p><p>The rear zipper is topped by a velcro tab at the top meant to snug the upper cuff around the lower calf to discourage water from migrating down the high ankle area. The cuff itself is a ring of thin and stretchy polyurethane that fits tightly and also helps minimize moisture creeping in from above. Reflective pull tabs at the heel help not only with pulling the Pioggia 4 securely back and around the rear of the shoe but also lend a bit of visibility for low light conditions. </p><p></p><p>At $80, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-pioggia-4-shoecover\">Sportful Pioggia 4</a></strong> represents a solid value because it can work on all of your fall, winter, and spring rides with temps under 55° F and above freezing. In the correct size, it also offers a more aero fit than many shoe covers offering similar levels of protection, making the Pioggia 4 a great choice for fast training rides and races early in the spring season.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-pioggia-4-shoecover\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF5QKZ4F/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tGood For Road And Gravel\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMPLLPLJ/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSportful Infinium Bootie All Road\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$95</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>134g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>GoreTex® Infinium</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S – XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1960\" height=\"1307\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road.jpeg 1960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Bootie-All-Road-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Burly construction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Versatile in cold and wet conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good for gravel too</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderately expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Sportful rates the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMPLLPLJ/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Infinium Bootie All Road</a></strong> for not only road but also gravel use, due to the reinforced stretch fabric that is used across the base of the upper. Not only does this stretchy, abrasion-resistant fabric stand up to grime and debris that kicks up off the roads in winter, but it also gives the Infinium Bootie a snug, aero fit that many other high-end shoe covers could not match.</p><p></p><p>The Infinium Bootie gets its name from the Gore-Tex Infinium fabric used across the entire upper. Infinium is an excellent choice for this application because it copes well with road spray and rainfall, but just as importantly, provides an unyielding barrier against wind, while also wicking away interior moisture. Infinium is also flexible and lightweight, which helped Sportful create a very well-balanced and versatile shoe cover in the Infiumium Bootie. </p><p></p><p>Reflective tabs lend some visibility in low light conditions, and the zipper is positioned to the outboard side of the bootie, to avoid bunching or irritation. Branding is very minimal, with just a simple Sportful “S” logo near the cuff. </p><p></p><p>At $95, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMPLLPLJ/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Sportful Infinium Bootie</a></strong> sits at a premium price but has a fairly modest look. Don’t let that fool you. Gore-Tex Infinium is arguably the best material for riding in cold and wet conditions, and combined with the reinforced footbed, makes the Sportful Infinium Bootie an excellent choice for anyone seeking a shoe cover that has them covered on both paved and gravel roads.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMPLLPLJ/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tVersatile For Road, Gravel, And MTB Shoes\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpearl-izumi-amfib-lite-shoe-cover\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPearl Izumi AmFIB Lite Shoe Covers\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$65</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>144g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>3-layer AmFIB softshell</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Sunfire (orange)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S – XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1217\" height=\"811\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers.jpeg 1217w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Lite-Shoe-Covers-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Warm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy on/off</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Run large</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fit is less precise</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpearl-izumi-amfib-lite-shoe-cover\">Pearl Izumi AmFIB Lite Shoe Cover</a></strong> is the solid choice to keep your feet warm and dry whether riding in road shoes with triangular plastic cleats or in MTB shoes with sole tread and small metal cleats or if you’re looking for a single shoe cover to handle both styles of shoes. </p><p></p><p>The AmFIB Lite shoe cover’s three-layer softshell fabric blocks wind and repels moisture while offering excellent breathability. The cuff is cut high to ensure generous overlap with tights, creating a weatherproof seal around the lower calf and ankle. </p><p></p><p><em>BioViz</em> reflective elements on the toe, side, and heel increase low-light visibility. Our test pair features the radiant “sunfire” orange colorway that is aimed at highlighting the rider’s biomotion which has been demonstrated to help motorists more rapidly identify approaching cyclists. </p><p></p><p>The AmFIB Lite shoe covers feature larger-than-average openings in the sole that accommodate the tread of MTB shoes. This sole design along with a slightly looser fit around the ankle and heel makes the AmFIB Lite shoe cover super easy to get into so you can spend less time getting dressed and more time riding. This does result in a less precise fit, however, and they tend to be a little looser around the feet than most other models we tested.</p><p></p><p>At $65, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpearl-izumi-amfib-lite-shoe-cover\">Pearl Izumi AmFIB Lite Shoe Cover</a></strong> is competitively priced against other shoe covers that offer the same level of protection.

Taped seams and a snug fit around the cleat and heel openings help keep rain and road spray out. An elasticated cuff around the ankle will stretch to fit around the ankle and the fit runs a bit large, so we recommend sizing down. Thankfully, the RaceAqua Waterproof Road Shoe Covers are offered in six sizes to help you find the right balance of snug, aero fit, and easy on/off.</p><p></p><p>The sole material is textured to avoid tears and extend the lifespan of the RaceAqua Waterproof Road Shoe Covers. The RaceAqua is available not only in black but also in a flashy hi-vis yellow colorway that is aimed at enhancing your visibility in the low-light conditions often present on dreary weather days of the fall, winter, and spring. </p><p></p><p>While the RaceAqua Waterproof Road Shoe Covers are amazing in the rain, we noticed that even in the low 40s, they didn’t keep our feet as warm as some other lightweight shoe covers we tested. So, we recommend the RaceAqua Waterproof Road Shoe Covers for milder conditions from the mid-40s to upper 50s. We also strongly recommend choosing the smallest size you can, based on the range of shoe sizes assigned to each size of the RaceAqua. For example, we tested size XXL for a size 46 shoe but could have easily fit into an XL instead, for a more aero fit and more secure fit around the ankle.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, at $55, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J07EM08/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">GripGrab RaceAqua Waterproof Road Shoe Covers</a></strong> is an affordable option that’s great for blocking wind and water while keeping the feet comfortable on cool days.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J07EM08/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tAffordable Toe Coverage\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F158982%2Fpearl-izumi-amfib-toe-covers%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPearl Izumi AmFIB Toe Covers\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$20</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>28g/pair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>AmFIB Softshell: 64% polyamide, 14% polyester, 14% polyurethane, 8% nylon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Screaming Yellow</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S/M, L/XL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1246\" height=\"831\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers.jpeg 1246w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pearl-Izumi-AmFIB-Toe-Covers-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Very affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy on and off</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Keeps toes nice and warm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Toe covers provide less protection than full covers</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F158982%2Fpearl-izumi-amfib-toe-covers%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Pearl Izumi AmFIB Toe Cover</a></strong> is a minimal but effective solution for riding in cool weather and on damp roads.

love riding outside and most of us will do whatever it takes to stay off the <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-indoor-bike-trainers/\">indoor trainer</a></strong> for as long as we possibly can. We know that riding in the colder temperatures and variable weather of the fall, winter, and spring is much more comfortable and enjoyable when we’re equipped with the right gear for the job. For road cycling, this includes a good pair of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">cycling bib tights</a>, a cycling jacket, and some winter cycling gloves, and, of course, shoe covers to keep our feet happy in less-than-ideal conditions. And, of course, we’re passionate about cycling gear and providing trustworthy product recommendations based on side-by-side comparative testing by our experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this buyer’s guide, we recruited our road cycling expert, Bennett Shane, to test each cycling shoe cover model over the course of several months. Bennett has been cycling seriously for over two decades, and while his racing days are behind him, he still spends an inordinate amount of time on the bike riding for fun, fitness, and lots of product testing. As a year-round outdoor cyclist based in the Portland, OR, area, Bennett is intimately familiar with riding in the highly variable weather conditions that are common in the Pacific Northwest through the fall, winter, and spring. He’s learned firsthand the importance of having the right gear to maintain his comfort and enhance his enjoyment on the bike. Bennett also spent many years working for various prominent brands in the cycling industry and has unique insight into products and technologies and he has astounding depth of knowledge. His cycling and industry experience combine to make him particularly adept and analyzing the performance and comparative differences of the products he tests. In addition to cycling shoe covers, Bennett has tested a range of products including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">best road bike shoes</a> and our favorite <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">cycling bib tights for keeping the legs warm</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best cycling shoe covers on the market, we rounded up a diverse selection of 13 models to test and compare side by side. Each model was sent to Bennett who carefully examined the design, materials, and construction of each model and weighed them all for consistency and comparison to manufacturers’ specs. For several months, he tested each pair on everything from brisk morning and evening rides to rainstorms and cold, misty mountain adventures. While riding, he carefully considered the fit, comfort, warmth, and weather protection of each model, and when testing concluded, zeroed in on his favorites and those that excel in specific ways compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Review author Bennett Shane kitted up to tackle some wet cold conditions while testing the best cycling shoe covers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shoe-covers-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Review author Bennett Shane kitted up to put the Endura Road Overshoes through their paces on some wet PNW roads.

Here we’ll break down the different types of shoe covers along with important considerations that play a role in deciding what shoe covers are best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Velocio-Signature-Rain-Bootie.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Velocio-Signature-Rain-Bootie.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Velocio Signature Rain Booties cycling shoe covers\" /></a><figcaption>Cycling shoe covers take many forms, from simple toe covers to full coverage models like the Velocio Signature Rain Booties pictured here. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are Cycling Shoe Covers?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overshoes, booties, shoe covers, and even toe covers are the various names that different brands use to refer to the covers you slip on over your <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">cycling shoes</a> to protect from cold, wind, and/or wet conditions while riding. Essentially, these are additional layers for the toes, feet, ankles, and lower leg that are intended to provide protection from the elements when riding in the cold temperatures and variable weather of the fall, winter, and spring, or any other time that conditions warrant. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Cycling Shoe Covers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like anything else in cycling, road shoe covers come in a huge range of different styles, materials, constructions, and designs to meet the demands of varying conditions and the needs of riders. From simple toe covers to take the edge off cold winds, insulated and waterproof models for riding in frigid temps and wet conditions, and everything in between, there are shoe covers specially made for every use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/VeloToze-Toe-Covers.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/VeloToze-Toe-Covers.jpeg\" /></a><figcaption>Toe covers, like the VeloToze, are a simple, effective, and affordable way to keep the chill and/or light road spray off your toes on cool days. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Toe Covers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Toe covers are the simplest form of shoe cover and they are exactly what they sound like. Toe covers are small sleeves that slip on over the toes and front portion of a cycling shoe and around the cleat to provide a barrier that blocks wind and moisture with the goal of keeping your toes warmer and drier than they would be without them. Given their simpler designs, constructions, and the amount of materials used, they are typically quite affordable compared to full coverage overshoes. They are also very lightweight and small, making them easy to stash in a jersey pocket or carry as an insurance policy if the conditions change while you’re out on a ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary drawback to toe covers is that they really only provide protection for the toes/front half of your feet, leaving your heel, ankle, and lower leg exposed to the elements. Still, they are great in the right conditions, and depending on your tolerance for cold, may be enough for many riders to make it through the majority of cool fall, winter, and spring riding in comfort without having to spend much money. In fact, the two models that we tested, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186H2XZI/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">VeloToze Toe Covers</a></strong> and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F158982%2Fpearl-izumi-amfib-toe-covers%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Pearl Izumi AmFIB Toe Covers</a></strong>, cost just $15 and $20, respectively, making them the most cost-effective options in this review.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Pioggia-4.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Pioggia-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Castelli Pioggia 4 cycling shoe covers\" /></a><figcaption>Full coverage shoe covers, overshoes, and booties, like the Castelli Pioggia 4 pictured here, cover the whole foot (minus holes on the bottom for the cleat and heel), extend slightly up the leg, and often have a zip up the back to get in and out of them more easily. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Overshoes, Booties, Full-Coverage Shoe Covers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-coverage shoe covers, overshoes, or booties are different from toe covers in that they cover the entirety of your shoe’s upper and typically extend part of the way up your lower leg to overlap <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">your bib tights</a> and provide protection for the ankle and sometimes the lower calf (or the entire calf in some cases). The soles of these shoe covers are generally made from a more abrasion-resistant material and have holes for the cleat and heel pad to stick through. Often, this style of shoe cover has a zipper on the back or side of the cuff to allow for easy entry and exit while others may slide on with the closure on the bottom of the foot. Overshoes like these come in every flavor imaginable, with thin and lightweight options for fending off wind and road spray in mild temperatures to insulated and “waterproof” models for riding in deep winter and/or full-on rainstorms.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conditions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The temperatures and weather conditions are one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a pair of shoe covers. If you only ride in dry conditions, then your needs will obviously be different from those who venture out when there’s the potential for showers, the roads are super wet, or it’s a full-on rainstorm. Being realistic about the conditions you’ll encounter, or that you’re actually willing to go ride in, will help you narrow down the choices to find the shoe cover or covers that will serve you best. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wind</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the temperature, the wind will almost always make it feel colder than it actually is. Even in the summer, bombing down a descent after you’ve sweat your way to the top can chill you to the core. This is especially true when it’s cool or cold outside as the chill of the wind effectively drops the temperature by around 10 degrees or more, and your extremities, the hands and feet, are the most susceptible to the effects. This is why one of the primary functions of all shoe covers is to block the wind, and virtually every model on the market does so relatively effectively, or at least much better than not wearing shoe covers at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ride in mild temperatures, around the 40s and 50s F, and dry conditions, then a light, wind-blocking toe cover or overshoe may be all you need to keep your toes and feet warm. Many lighter shoe covers can also be used in colder temperatures when worn with heavier socks or less ventilated shoes. Also, there are plenty of thinner, lightweight options that are also made from waterproof materials for wet days in cool conditions. Once you factor in cold temperatures, however, you’ll want to add some insulation to the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Covers.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Estremo-Shoe-Covers.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Castelli Estremo Shoe Covers\" /></a><figcaption>While they might not look it, the Castelli Estremo Shoe Covers are some of the warmest we tested and perfect for those really cold rides.

How much insulation you need depends on how cold of temperatures you’re willing to go ride in, but also other factors like sock choice, shoes, etc. Either way, brands go about insulating shoe covers in various ways. Many simply use softshell fabrics that have some thermal properties, while others may line their covers with soft fleece materials like Polartec Power Stretch Pro. Neoprene is another common material used in shoe covers because of its excellent insulating properties and its ability to maintain warmth even when wet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like lighter-weight options for milder conditions, insulated shoe covers typically aim to provide some level of waterproofness or at least water resistance. Of the models we tested, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-estremo-shoe-cover\">Castelli Estremo</a></strong>, Spatzwear Spatz Pro 2, and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fassos-assosoires-gt-ultraz-winter-bootie\">Assos GT Ultraz Winter Booties</a></strong> are the best suited to properly cold conditions. One thing that commonly plagues more insulated shoe covers is that they can cause the feet to overheat once temperatures rise or you’re riding at high intensity. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoes.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Endura-Road-Overshoes.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Endura Road Overshoes\" /></a><figcaption>Smooth-faced Neoprene is used in some shoe covers for wet weather, like the Endura Road Overshoes pictured here, as its smooth surface repels water effectively and they provide warmth even when wet. (photo/Benett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping the feet dry when riding in wet conditions is a challenge and many shoe covers aim to do just that. While some use water-resistant materials to fend off passing showers and light road spray, others are constructed from “waterproof” materials with the goal of handling steady rains and significant amounts of moisture. Even with “waterproof” models, it’s important to understand that keeping your feet bone dry whilst riding in the rain is not a realistic objective. Road spray, sweat, and water migrating down your legs means that after enough time in steady rains, your feet are eventually going to get wet. The only unknown is whether they will go numb from loss of circulation, or stay comfortable thanks to a properly insulated pair of shoe covers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since most people avoid riding in proper rainstorms, it’s more likely that you’ll get caught out in passing showers when the weather is unsettled or you’ll end up riding on wet roads with light spray coming off your tires. For these situations, shoe covers made from materials like Gore-Tex Infinium, like the Castelli Estremo and the Sportful Infinium Bootie, provide good protection and water resistance along with admirable breathability. The shoe covers that aim to be waterproof use a variety of different materials with many incorporating waterproof membranes and taped seams in their constructions. These include the <em>Artex</em> membrane sandwiched in the layers of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F890980%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-bike-socks-blackchili%3Fcolor%3DBLACK%2FCHILI%2520PEPPER\">Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Socks</a></strong>, or the Waterproof PU-coated fabric of the Castelli Pioggia 4 that provides a barrier that water isn’t able to easily pass through. Neoprene, especially neoprene with a smooth outer finish, like that found on the <strong><a href=\"https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-pro2-overshoes-our-flagship-overshoe-like-nothing-else-pro2?variant=33016737005652\">Spatzwear Spatz Pro 2</a></strong> and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fendura-road-overshoe-shoe-covers-black-s-e1270bk-3%2Fp1364348%3Fv%3D1363241\">Endura Road Overshoes</a>, is also highly effective at shedding water and not getting soaked. When moisture eventually creeps in from the legs or from underneath, neoprene does a great job of staying warm even when wet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Booties-reflective.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Sportful-Infinium-Booties-reflective.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Sportful Infinium All Road Booties\" /></a><figcaption>Reflective accents, like the stripes on the back of the Sportful Infinium All Road Booties, add visibility for motorists in low light conditions.

For this reason, we like having reflective elements added to our cycling shoe covers or the option to get bright, high-visibility colors. While most other elements of the cool weather riding kit, like bib tights, <strong>cycling jackets</strong>, and even <strong>winter cycling gloves</strong>, will likely have some reflectives on them as well, often your shoe covers may end up obscuring those on the calf area of your tights, making them even more important for visibility. Nearly every shoe cover includes reflective patches or logos on them, though some brands prioritize it more than others. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Bootie-sole.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Fizik-Waterproof-Winter-Bootie-sole.jpeg\" alt=\"A look at the sole of the Fizik Waterproof Winter booties cycling shoe covers\" /></a><figcaption>A close look at the soles on the Fizik Waterproof Winter Booties. The reinforced cutouts line up well with the cleat and heel pad and the solare material itself is more robust than the uppers. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Durability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing lasts forever, and that’s particularly true of cycling shoe covers. Certain materials are simply more prone to wear and tear than others, especially when they are attached to your feet. Your shoe cover will be subject to stretching and pulling when getting them on and off, as well as moisture, dust, road grit, and more. And, of course, if you treat them carelessly or they are scraped against sharp objects or dragged across the pavement, they will wear out more quickly. When treated with care, however, it’s fair to expect to get a couple seasons or more of use out of them, depending on how much use they get. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest factors that impact a shoe cover’s durability, however, is the sole. There are cutouts to allow the cleat and the heel to stick through, and usually, these are reinforced to prevent rips when pulling them on. Still, ensuring you have the correct size will make it so the heel pad and cleat line up with these holes properly to avoid over-stretching them and so you are less likely to step on the material when walking. Most models also employ a more robust material across the sole, sometimes a Kevlar material or something similar, that can stand up to occasional encounters with the ground when you clip out when stopped or are walking short distances in your shoes. Regardless, it is best to try and avoid walking around in your shoe covers as it will undoubtedly impact the soles and be one of the factors that play into their eventual demise. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Spatzwear-Spatz-Pro-2.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Spatzwear-Spatz-Pro-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Spatzwear Spatz Pro 2 cycling shoe covers\" /></a><figcaption>If you’re serious about riding through miserable conditions, then the Spatzwear Spatz Pro 2 might be worth their weight in gold despite their higher price and funky looks. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any other cycling accessory, the price of shoe covers varies pretty dramatically and you can spend a lot or a little on them depending on your specific needs and budget. Some brands just command higher prices while some of the more robust and protective models cost more due to more advanced materials, designs, and constructions. If you’re expecting your shoe covers to keep you both warm and dry while riding in near freezing temperatures and/or rain in the heart of winter, then you’ll probably want to spend a bit more for something like the <strong><a href=\"https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-pro2-overshoes-our-flagship-overshoe-like-nothing-else-pro2?variant=33016737005652\">Spatzwear Spatz Pro 2 Overshoes</a></strong>, $125, for maximum coverage and weather protection. If you just need to protect your toes from cooler temperatures and biting winds, you can spend as little as $15 on something like the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186H2XZI/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">VeloToze Toe Covers</a></strong> that will get the job done for lots of spring and fall rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, you can also find great value in between those extremes for models like the <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017AXNWJ0/?tag=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers-20\">Fizik Waterproof Winter Booties</a></strong>, $70, that work, look, and feel great in a wide range of temperatures and conditions, or even the GripGrab Race Aqua Waterproof Road shoe covers, $55, for those wet days with milder temperatures. And, we have had great success modifying the <strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F890980%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-bike-socks-blackchili%3Fcolor%3DBLACK%2FCHILI%2520PEPPER\">Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Socks</a></strong>, $40, to work over the shoes, providing warmth, wind, and water protection for a bargain price.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pas-Crosspoint-Waterproof-Socks.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/12/Showers-Pas-Crosspoint-Waterproof-Socks.jpeg\" alt=\"They might look a little different, bu\" /></a><figcaption>They might look a little different but a simple modification to the Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Socks gets the job done for less, and they’re actually waterproof.

Since your feet are very susceptible to the effects of cold, wind, and water, protecting them from the elements will help you stay more comfortable for longer and increase your enjoyment on the bike. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I know which cycling shoe covers will be best for me?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Finding the right shoe covers really comes down to the conditions you expect to encounter and then matching your needs for warmth and weather protection accordingly. When you consider your climate and take into account the conditions you’re willing to go out and ride in (tolerance for cold and wet), you should be able to narrow down the choices to find the right pair. And, as mentioned above, it might make sense to have more than one pair to cover all your needs. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do I need multiple different pairs of cycling shoe covers?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It really depends on the range of conditions that you’ll be riding in. Many people will probably be fine with a versatile pair of shoe covers that handles the majority of their needs, while others may encounter conditions that vary so dramatically that multiple options are needed to keep them comfortable through all of it. For example, if you ride in mild and wet conditions, something like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-rain-bootie\">Velocio Signature Rain Bootie</a> will be a great fit, but if you’re heading out in properly freezing temperatures, it might not be. Similarly, if you have shoe covers for sub-freezing temperatures, like the Castelli Estremo, they won’t be great when temperatures climb above around 40° F. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Are there alternatives to cycling shoe covers?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Shoe covers are not the only choice when it comes to riding in cold or wet weather. Many brands make specialized cold and/or wet-weather shoes that are a good option for truly dedicated foul-weather cyclists. Waterproof socks, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingshoecovers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F890980%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-bike-socks-blackchili%3Fcolor%3DBLACK%2FCHILI%2520PEPPER\">Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Socks</a>, are a low-cost option that can help to keep wind and water from reaching your feet, although your shoes can still get wet when wearing them. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">\n\t\t<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Tights of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cycling-bib-tights-lead-image-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">\n\t\tThe Best Cycling Bib Tights of 2023\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>As the seasons change, a quality pair of cycling bib tights can help you keep riding through the cooler months.
