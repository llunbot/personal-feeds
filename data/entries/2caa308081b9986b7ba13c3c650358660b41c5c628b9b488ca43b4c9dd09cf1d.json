The company is announcing three new GPUs today: The 5060 Ti will launch on April 16 in both 8GB and 16GB variations, for $379 and $429, respectively. The regular RTX 5060 will follow at some point in May for the same $299 MSRP as the last-generation RTX 4060. It is also sticking with 8GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>Obviously, it remains to be seen whether the company and its partners can actually stock these cards at these prices. GPUs from the top-tier <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/review-nvidias-geforce-rtx-5090-is-the-first-gpu-that-can-beat-the-rtx-4090/\">RTX 5090</a> to the mainstream <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-no-its-not-4090-performance-at-549/\">RTX 5070</a> have been difficult to impossible to buy at their announced MSRPs. And it's not just Nvidia's problem or a high-end problemâ€”<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/\">AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series GPUs</a> have also been hard to buy, as have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/\">Intel's Arc B580</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-arc-b570-review-at-219-the-cheapest-good-graphics-card/\">B570</a> cards.</p>\n<p>The new graphics cards' specs essentially match numbers that have been floating around for a couple of months now. Both models include modest increases in the number of CUDA cores compared to the last-generation 4060 and 4060 Ti models, with the same amount of RAM and the same 128-bit memory interface. But an upgrade to GDDR7 instead of GDDR6 provides a healthy bump to memory bandwidth and is probably also partially responsible for an increase in peak power consumption. The 4060 Ti in particular was memory bandwidth-constrained at higher resolutions, so hopefully some extra bandwidth will make it a better choice for a decent 1440p gaming PC.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-nudges-mainstream-gaming-pcs-forward-with-rtx-5060-series-starting-at-299/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-nudges-mainstream-gaming-pcs-forward-with-rtx-5060-series-starting-at-299/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2caa308081b9986b7ba13c3c650358660b41c5c628b9b488ca43b4c9dd09cf1d","category":"Tech"}
