The test, intended to demonstrate Russia's capability to shoot down assets in space, showered more than 1,500 pieces of debris into low-Earth orbit. This has forced the International Space Station and Chinese Tiangong station to perform avoidance maneuvers, along with many private and government-owned satellites.</p>\n<p>Russia is not the only country to perform such tests. India recently did so, and in the more distant past, China and the US have also demonstrated such capabilities.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984011#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984011&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"734138d4a126070714b4e4c20fb45d2836413d19d9fa40c47882ca7ccc32b7c2","category":"Tech"}
