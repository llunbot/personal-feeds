And experts have noted the influence of political factors. For instance, the first Trump administration repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html\">undermined</a> scientists—a trend repeating in his <a href=\"https://blog.ucsusa.org/jules-barbati-dajches/how-science-has-fared-in-the-first-two-weeks-of-trump-2-0/\">second term</a> so far.</p>\n<p>But what does the research say about where public trust in science, doctors, and health care institutions actually stands? In recent years, researchers have been increasingly looking into quantifying these sentiments. And indeed, <a href=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/major-declines-in-the-publics-confidence-in-science-in-the-wake-of-the-pandemic/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/15/americans-trust-in-scientists-other-groups-declines/\">surveys</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319488121\">studies</a> have reported the COVID-19 pandemic correlated with a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821693\">decline</a> in trust in the years following the initial outbreak. This decrease, though, seems to be waning as new research shows a clearer picture of trust across time. One 2024 study suggests Trump’s attacks on science during his first term did not have the significant impact many experts feared—and may have even <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/survey-suggests-trump-s-attacks-boosted-public-trust-science\">boosted</a> confidence among certain segments of the population.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/can-public-trust-in-science-survive-a-second-battering/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/can-public-trust-in-science-survive-a-second-battering/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Claudia López Lloreda, Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"542df076df184ca0513f07bc11824c6c50a8dc1c9638c9e6c7542b69427f61cf","category":"Tech"}
