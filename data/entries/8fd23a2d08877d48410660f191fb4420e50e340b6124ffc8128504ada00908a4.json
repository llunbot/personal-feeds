The work is part of an ongoing research project to scientifically explore the artist's painting materials and techniques. The discovery will be one of many findings included in a new book, <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/rene-magritte-the-artist-s-materials-francisca-vandepitte/19039578?ean=9781606068007\">René Magritte: The Artist’s Materials</a>,</em> to be published later this month by the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“Although there have been plenty of times when the technical examination of artworks has revealed a second image beneath a painting’s surface, it is always exciting when a new example is discovered,\" Thomas Learner, head of science at the Getty Conservation Institute, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/30/hidden-meaning-of-magritte-uncovered-as-new-image-is-found-under-painting\">told The Guardian</a>. \"In this case, the IR reflectography image is so clear and striking that it even raises the possibility of identifying the sitter.\"</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/x-rays-reveal-hidden-first-drafts-of-ancient-egyptian-paintings-at-theban-necropolis/\">previously reported</a>, X-rays are now a <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/csi-picasso-x-rays-reveal-the-master-8217-s-materials/\">well-established tool</a> to help analyze and restore valuable paintings because the rays' higher frequency means they pass right through paintings without harming them. X-ray imaging <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/x-rays-reveal-what-lies-beneath/\">can reveal anything</a> that has been painted over a canvas or where the artist may have altered his (or her) original vision. For instance, Vermeer's <em>Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window </em>was first subjected to X-ray analysis in 1979 and revealed the image of a Cupid lurking under the overpainting. And last year, conservationists who were conducting an X-ray analysis of Vincent van Gogh's <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/4972\"><em>Head of a Peasant Woman</em></a> discovered <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/x-rays-reveal-hidden-van-gogh-self-portrait/\">a hidden self-portrait</a> on the back of the canvas. <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/x-rays-reveal-what-lies-beneath/#googDisableSync\">In 2008</a>, European scientists used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/31/2\">synchrotron radiation to reconstruct</a> the hidden portrait of a peasant woman painted by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh\">Van Gogh</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958278#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958278&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8fd23a2d08877d48410660f191fb4420e50e340b6124ffc8128504ada00908a4","category":"Tech"}
