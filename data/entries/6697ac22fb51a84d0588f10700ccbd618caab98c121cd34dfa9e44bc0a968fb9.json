It is true that iPhone sales have been relatively flat for two years — here are the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/04/iphone-revenue-q1-2024-sixcolors.png\">quarterly revenue</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/04/iphone-revenue-change-q1-2024-sixcolors.png\">year-over-year revenue change</a> charts from Six Colors <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/02/apple-reports-nearly-120b-quarter-full-charts/\">for the October–December 2023 quarter</a>. But they’re not in decline. Apple’s problem — or perhaps better said, Apple <em>investors</em>’ problem — is that iPhone sales have peaked because they’ve saturated the globe. Everyone who wants one and can afford one has one.</p>\n\n<p>But whatever is going on with iPhone sales, a comparison to Boeing is just dumb. Boeing’s problem isn’t cheap Chinese competition. It’s that when Boeing was <em>Boeing</em> — a truly great American company — it was an engineering-driven company. It was — past tense — in broad strokes similar to Apple in that regard. Then Boeing “merged” with McDonnell Douglas, the McDonnell Douglas CEO became Boeing’s CEO, other executives <em>with zero aviation experience</em> came over from companies like General Electric, and “<a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/did-a-1997-merger-ruin-boeing/\">a passion for great planes was replaced with a passion for affordability</a>.” The 737 Max isn’t just unpopular — it’s an engineering disaster. The iPhone 15 lineup is, by consensus, the best lineup of phones in the industry — the fastest chips, great reliability, and industry-leading customer satisfaction. Even if iPhone sales were in decline — which only IDC is claiming to be true — it’s not for reasons that bear any resemblance to Boeing at all.</p>\n\n<p>Call me when Apple is led by executives who lack a passion for great computers.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/16/seeing-what-one-wants-to-see\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6697ac22fb51a84d0588f10700ccbd618caab98c121cd34dfa9e44bc0a968fb9","category":"Tech"}
