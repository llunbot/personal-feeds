Neurodiversity tends to get overlooked in the design process. Or it is tackled late in the process, and only if there is enough time.</p>\n<p>But <strong>people aren’t edge cases</strong>. Every person is just a different person, performing tasks and navigating the web in a different way. So how can we design better, <strong>more inclusive experiences</strong> that cater to different needs and, ultimately, benefit everyone? Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-for-neurodiversity/1-neurodiversity-practical-guides.jpeg\" /></p>\nNeurodiversity Or Neurodivergent?\n<p>There is quite a bit of confusion about both terms on the web. Different people think and experience the world differently, and <strong>neurodiversity</strong> sees differences as natural variations, not deficits. It distinguishes between <strong>neurotypical</strong> and <strong>neurodivergent</strong> people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neurotypical</strong> people see the world in a “typical” and widely perceived as expected way.</li>\n<li><strong>Neurodivergent</strong> people experience the world differently, for example, people with ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, synesthesia, and hyperlexia.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to various sources, around <strong>15–40% of the population</strong> has neurodivergent traits. These traits can be innate (e.g., autism) or acquired (e.g., trauma). But they are always on a spectrum, and vary a lot. A person with <strong>autism is not neurodiverse</strong> — they are neurodivergent.</p>\n<p>One of the main strengths of neurodivergent people is how <strong>imaginative and creative</strong> they are, coming up with out-of-the-box ideas quickly. With exceptional levels of attention, strong long-term memory, a unique perspective, unbeatable accuracy, and a strong sense of justice and fairness.</p>\n<p>Being different in a world that, to some degree, still doesn’t accept these differences is exhausting. So unsurprisingly, neurodivergent people often bring along determination, resilience, and <strong>high levels of empathy</strong>.</p>\nDesign With People, Not For Them\n<p>As a designer, I often see myself as a <strong>path-maker</strong>. I’m designing reliable paths for people to navigate to their goals comfortably. Without being blocked. Or confused. Or locked out.</p>\n<p>That means respecting the simple fact that people’s needs, tasks, and user journeys are all different, and that they evolve over time. And: most importantly, it means considering them very <strong>early in the process</strong>.</p>\n<p>Better accessibility is better for everyone. Instead of making decisions that need to be reverted or refined to be compliant, we can bring a <strong>diverse group of people</strong> — with accessibility needs, with neurodiversity, frequent and infrequent users, experts, newcomers — in the process, and design with them, rather than for them.</p>\nNeurodiversity &amp; Inclusive Design Resources\n<p>A wonderful resource that helps us design for cognitive accessibility is Stéphanie Walter’s <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/neurodiversity-and-ux-essential-resources-for-cognitive-accessibility/\"><strong>Neurodiversity and UX toolkit</strong></a>. It includes <strong>practical guidelines</strong>, tools, and resources to better understand and design for dyslexia, dyscalculia, autism, and ADHD.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-for-neurodiversity/2-neurodiversity-and-ux-essential-resources-for-cognitive-accessibility.png\" /></p>\n<p>Another fantastic resource is Will Soward’s <a href=\"https://neurodiversity.design/\"><strong>Neurodiversity Design System</strong></a>. It combines neurodiversity and user experience design into a set of design standards and principles that you can use to design accessible learning interfaces.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I’ve been putting together a few summaries about <strong>neurodiversity and inclusive design</strong> over the last few years, so you might find them helpful, too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-accessibility-activity-7188133636985028608-JEtj/\">ADHD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-accessibility-activity-7099294629887397888-L1d0/\">Autism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-activity-7156651715486732288-RvW7/\">Children</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-accessibility-activity-7087333591906430976-PHsN\">Colorblindness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-accessibility-activity-7178702360649547778-4JtQ\">Deafness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-accessibility-activity-7111249864855810048-5qup\">Dyscalculia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-accessibility-activity-7079355423534784512-3R4C\">Dyslexia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-typography-activity-7095664890727526400-ECAH\">Legibility</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-activity-7132292750355378176-ZMkL\">Left-Handed Users</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-designpatterns-activity-7088778491109720064-im2_\">Mental Health</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-learning-activity-7105272692919914496-Q2-y/\">Motivation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-accessibility-activity-7089866429016989696-JRAq\">Older Adults</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_how-screen-readers-work-and-how-activity-7130472748371341312-i0PW\">Screen Readers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-activity-7160904166075232256-mNMc\">Teenagers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A huge thank-you to everyone who has been writing, speaking, and sharing articles, resources, and toolkits on designing for diversity.
