Choose from HG, XD, and Micro Spline freehub bodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b.jpg\"><img width=\"1905\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b.jpg\" alt=\"industry nine fat bike hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b.jpg 1905w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b-297x118.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b-800x317.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b-120x47.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b-768x304.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/industry-nine-fat-bike-hubs-2023-winter-2024-b-1536x608.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all of their hubs, the shells and end caps are machined in house, and the pawls and ratchet rings are EDM wire cut there, too. The only parts coming from outside their walls are the bearings. Even the anodization is done on site, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $250 front and $475 rear, available now while they last. Or save $5 and get a set for $720. Ceramic bearing upgrades available, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://industrynine.com/hubs/fatbike\" target=\"_blank\">IndustryNine.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/industry-nine-hydra-fat-bike-hubs-are-back-for-winter/\">Industry Nine Hydra Fat Bike Hubs are Back for Winter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3ed8b55996a3c49171f5f5ecbfcec3c8eb6cbdd394190e6e49e5fbe7ec211c62","category":"Cycling"}
