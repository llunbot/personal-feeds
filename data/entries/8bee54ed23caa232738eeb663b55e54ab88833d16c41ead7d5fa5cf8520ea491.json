Compared to JPEG, JPEG-XL has improved compression for smaller file sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-capture-button.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple did not mention JPEG-XL support during today's event, but this feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/iphone-16-lineup-wave-of-camera-improvements/\">was rumored</a> ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> launch. It appears that the Pro models will support capturing images in JPEG-XL.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to the HEIC format that Apple introduced several years ago, JPEG-XL supports both lossy and lossless compression. HEIC is a lossy format, and while it retains better quality than JPG images, pros will likely prefer JPEG-XL for zero image degradation. HEIC has never gained wide support, which has hindered its usefulness.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHEIC will still be available alongside JPEG, JPEG-XL, and other formats.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/\">September 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-pro-supports-jpeg-xl-format/\">iPhone 16 Pro Supports JPEG-XL Format</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-supports-jpeg-xl-format.2435587/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8bee54ed23caa232738eeb663b55e54ab88833d16c41ead7d5fa5cf8520ea491","category":"Apple"}
