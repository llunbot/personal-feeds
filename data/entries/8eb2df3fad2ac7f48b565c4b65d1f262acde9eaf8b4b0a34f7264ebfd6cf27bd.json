I’ve never seen weather forecasts presented quite like this. A very glanceable presentation of precipitation chances, cloud cover, and, of course, temperature. (Weather Strip cleverly only shows the “feels like” temperature when it differs from the actual temperature by at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit. The biggest downside is that it’s U.S.-only:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Weather Strip forecasts come directly from the U.S. National\nWeather Service (NOAA), so the app is currently limited to the\nUnited States. Forecasts usually span 168 hours (7 days) but can\noccasionally be longer or shorter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just $1/month, or a mere $4/year. Insta-buy for me at that annual rate — and there’s a one-month trial period.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/13/weather-strip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8eb2df3fad2ac7f48b565c4b65d1f262acde9eaf8b4b0a34f7264ebfd6cf27bd","category":"Tech"}
