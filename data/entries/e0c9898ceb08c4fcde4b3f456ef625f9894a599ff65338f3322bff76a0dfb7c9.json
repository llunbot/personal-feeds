It was also key in his failure to defend his title in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Often it’s where the race really gets broken up, which means it’s nice to get off Mons-en-Pévèle and be at the front, as you know you’re really in the mix then.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much so that Hayman points out that the first five riders off that section in 2016 – him, Tom Boonen, Ian Stannard, Sep Vanmarcke and Edvald Boasson Hagen – made up the top five at the finish in Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/02163711/insight_paris_roubaix_05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"The dusty section of cobbles sits below a field of green grass and light blue sky, with yellowish trees in the distance.
