Discovery's (WBD) streaming service Max will be called HBO Max starting this summer, bringing back a name that WBD curiously ditched a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>In May 2020, the company then known as WarnerMedia Group launched its flagship streaming service, HBO Max. The successor to the HBO Now subscription-based streaming service that launched in 2014, and not to be confused with the now-defunct HBO Go (which was a video-on-demand streaming service accessible to those with subscriptions to the HBO cable channel), HBO Max offered “the entire HBO service,” per WarnerMedia’s announcement. HBO Max also combined content from other titles WarnerMedia owned, including titles from DC Comics and Cartoon Network. But the main draw continued to be the ability to stream HBO’s prestigious library via a Netflix-like streaming subscription.</p>\n<p>When WarnerMedia acquired Discovery in 2022 and became WBD, it sought to combine the libraries of HBO Max and the Discovery+ streaming service. WBD landed on Max as the name for the combined app. The name seemed to suggest access to a maximum amount of streaming content with maximum appeal. However, it questionably distanced itself from the legacy of high-budget, award-winning TV shows and recent popular movies that the HBO brand had been building since 1972.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/max-pivots-back-to-hbo-max-as-wbd-rethinks-ability-to-compete-with-netflix/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/max-pivots-back-to-hbo-max-as-wbd-rethinks-ability-to-compete-with-netflix/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a57cd0c7bbbb7ef77fbb84b6cfdb0676a1e5abc6a1756f13e41653f5de99aeee","category":"Tech"}
