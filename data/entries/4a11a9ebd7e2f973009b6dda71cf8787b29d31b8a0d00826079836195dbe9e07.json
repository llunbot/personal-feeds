These even ditch the extra carbon spacer the mountain bike wheels put around the alloy hub shells, as Syncros realized their bonding process made them unnecessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_CFD.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_CFD.jpg\" alt=\"Syncros Capital SL Aero ultralight monocoque carbon road bike wheels, CFD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_CFD.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_CFD-297x83.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_CFD-800x224.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_CFD-120x34.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_CFD-768x215.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Low aero drag is the biggest real difference between the new Capital SLs and the mountain biking Silverton SLs. Syncros optimized aerodynamics in two different rim depths – 40mm or 60mm – based on 3 years of real race wind data collected by team DSM, to get a weighted impact of -20 to +20° yaw angles to find a single weighted drag figure to optimize for real race conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Syncros Capital SL Aero ultralight monocoque carbon road bike wheels, spoke &amp; hub detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-Aero-ultralight-monocoque-carbon-road-bike-wheels_hub-and-spoke-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly to me, the carbon spokes stick with a mostly flat 2mm thin profile x 4.75mm wide.

Syncros says the Capital SL Aero has about 15% lower rotational drag than a comparable Zipp 404 Firecrest wheel, thanks to the 1-piece design, optimized spokes, fewer spokes, and no nipples.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

The biggest change besides going to narrower &amp; deeper rims was moving the carbon spoke attachment close to the centerline of the rim. Compared to the MTB wheels which <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/syncros-one-piece-carbon-silverton-sl-wheels-go-wide-30mm-internal-for-nino-kate/\" target=\"_blank\">align the spokes with the outside edge</a> of the rim for max stiffness, the Capital SL wheels are able to maintain the stiff ride feel from hub to rim, while allowing the rim itself to slightly flex independent of the ultra-stiff spokes for more of a snappy feel when cornering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
