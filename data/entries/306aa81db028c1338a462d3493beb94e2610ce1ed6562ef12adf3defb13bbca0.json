The release comes after the release candidate beta was distributed to developers and public beta testers last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma 14.3: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sonoma 14.3 has the collaborative playlist feature for Apple Music. This feature had appeared in betas prior to 14.3, but was pulled. Along with collaborative playlists, users can make emoji reactions to tracks. Apple also updated the AppleCare &amp; Warranty section in the General System Settings to show coverage of all devices signed into your Apple ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update also includes bug fixes and security patches. The security patches are detailed in Apple’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222&amp;xcust=1-1-2170985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">security release notes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma 14.3 release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are the notes include with the release candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>macOS Sonoma 14.3 introduces enhancements to Apple Music, as well as other features, bug fixes, and security updates for your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborate on playlists in Apple Music allows you to invite friends to join your playlist and everyone can add, reorder, and remove songs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Emoji reactions can be added to any track in a collaborative playlist in Apple Music</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AppleCare &amp; Warranty in Settings shows your coverage for all devices signed in with your Apple ID</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some features may not be available for all regions, or on all Apple devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma 14.3: How to install</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer betas are available to anyone who has enrolled in Apple’s Developer Program. Apple usually issues a public beta a day or two after the developer beta has been released. We have a complete <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">guide to downloading and installing the Sonoma betas</a> if you are interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To access the pubic beta, go to <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em>, then in the Beta Updates section, click the Info button (the “I” icon), click the pop-up menu for <em>Beta Updates</em>, and select <em>macOS Sonoma Public Beta</em>. You may need to restart the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While betas give early access to fixes and features to the operating system, they are issued with the idea that users will test the software and check for bugs. This means that the betas have some instability to them and may cause issues with your Mac. If you can’t afford to take the risk of a possible crash or a disruption of usability, you should not run the beta and wait for the release to the general public.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"306aa81db028c1338a462d3493beb94e2610ce1ed6562ef12adf3defb13bbca0","category":"Apple"}
