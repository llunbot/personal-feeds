Qi2 was mentioned in the release notes for the RC version of the update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/\">that came out today</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/magsafe-blue-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWith the addition of support for the new standard, ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 14‌ models will work with Qi2 wireless chargers. Qi2 is a next-generation Qi wireless charging technology that incorporates a Magnetic Power Profile. Qi2 devices will work like accessories that support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>, using magnets for alignment and speedier charging. Apple added Qi2 support to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models ahead of release, so they are already compatible with the standard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Magnetic Power Profile was designed based on ‌‌MagSafe‌‌ contributions from Apple, and it is being combined with the new Extended Power Profile (EPP) to form what is considered \"Qi2.\" Qi2 is meant to ensure that phones and other battery-powered mobile products are perfectly aligned with chargers for improved energy efficiency and faster charging. It will allow for new accessories that would not be chargeable wirelessly using existing flat surface-to-flat surface devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Qi2 chargers will be able to charge devices at up to 15W, it is not yet clear if Apple's iPhones will support faster wireless charging speeds with Qi2 accessories. For the ‌iPhone 15‌ models, for example, Apple's technical specifications page says that the devices still support Qi wireless charging \"up to 7.5W\" despite the fact that they work with Qi2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first Qi2 accessories are set to launch during the holiday season.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qi2/\">Qi2</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-qi-iphone-13-14-models/\">iOS 17.2 Brings Qi2 Support to iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-brings-qi2-support-to-iphone-13-and-iphone-14-models.2412896/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2f2a293eb7426ac5245f00ae4c0dcd830cde20af150c26d3ae0caa8f57131ef0","category":"Apple"}
