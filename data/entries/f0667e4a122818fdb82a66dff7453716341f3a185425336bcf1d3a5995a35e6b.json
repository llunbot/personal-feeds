/>\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ is a significant upgrade over the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, introducing meaningful quality-of-life features like the USB-C port and Action button that change the methods of interaction with the device. The new, considerably more lightweight titanium design, slimmer borders around the display, and contoured edges result in a noticeably different aesthetic and feel in the hand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ also brings major advancements to photography and videography, adding larger apertures, an Adaptive True Tone flash, a 48-megapixel main camera for high-resolution images and, on the larger model, a telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. Software features such as Photonic Engine, Smart HDR 5, Next-generation portraits, Action mode, and a host of professional videography features like external recording and Log also take the photography and videography capabilities of the device to the next level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is not to mention fast data transfer via USB 3, satellite connectivity, new color options, the second-generation ultra wideband chip, and the A17 Pro chip – Apple's first chip made with a ‌3nm‌ fabrication process, which radically improves the gaming capabilities of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDue to the scale and breadth of these improvements, most ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro will be able to justify upgrading to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, especially if they value the new design, USB-C port, Action button, and camera improvements. It is only worth sticking with the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro if you are holding off for an even more substantial upgrade in the future, but many users will see tangible benefits by upgrading now.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-13-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer's Guide: 50+ Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-50-differences-compared.2404752/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0667e4a122818fdb82a66dff7453716341f3a185425336bcf1d3a5995a35e6b","category":"Apple"}
