{"title":"Deals: New AirPods Pro With MagSafe Case Already Down to $219.99 ($29 Off)","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/deals-airpods-pro-magsafe-220/","date":1634954678000,"content":"Alongside the third-generation AirPods, Apple this week also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/airpods-pro-magsafe-charging-case/\">introduced a minor update for the AirPods Pro</a> to add MagSafe support to the charging case. MagSafe makes for easier alignment of the AirPods Pro case on compatible magnetic chargers and allows it to stick on angled chargers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/AirPods-Pro-Discount-Feature-Triad.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

The new AirPods Pro are in stock with delivery available next week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$29 OFF</div>AirPods Pro w/ MagSafe Case for $219.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe discounted price still marks a $23 premium over the original version at the moment, with Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">currently pricing the non-MagSafe version at $197.00</a>. We even saw them go as low as $169.00 around Black Friday last year, so if MagSafe isn't a necessity for you, you may still want to shop around for a good deal on the older ones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirPods and AirPods Pro make for popular gifts and we commonly see discounted pricing on them, especially leading into the holiday shopping season, so we're likely to see more deals on these in the coming weeks, but it's a good sign for supplies that we're already seeing significant discounts right at launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/deals-airpods-pro-magsafe-220/\">Deals: New AirPods Pro With MagSafe Case Already Down to $219.99 ($29 Off)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-new-airpods-pro-with-magsafe-case-already-down-to-219-99-29-off.2318761/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DDV5Cl0sMf0:X9ItYRrVHm4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DDV5Cl0sMf0:X9ItYRrVHm4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DDV5Cl0sMf0\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0f69ced3a376cc72042c6ec191413d60e10a4b7e4250d031a341def45bbd23e5","category":"Apple"}
