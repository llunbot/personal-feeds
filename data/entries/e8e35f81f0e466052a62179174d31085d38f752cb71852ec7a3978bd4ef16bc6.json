The decline sparked discussion on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1fw6rhg/the_us_has_passed_peak_obesity_a_new_survey/?rdt=35656\">social media</a> and in major <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/08/obesity-rate-ozempic-wegovy/\">news</a> <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/health/obesity-rates-us-ozempic-weight-loss-b2624064.html\">outlets</a> about whether the US has passed so-called “peak obesity”—and whether the growing use of certain weight-loss drugs might account for the shift.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21bd0b9c-a3c4-4c7c-bc6e-7bb6c3556a56?\">opinion piece</a> in the Financial Times suggested that the public health world might look back on the current moment in much the same way that it now reflects on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/01/archives/tobacco-industrys-peak-year-523-billion-cigarettes-smoked.html\">1963</a>, when cigarette sales hit their high point and then dropped dramatically over the following decades. The article’s author, John Burn-Murdoch, speculated that the dip is “highly likely” to be caused by the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s, for weight loss.</p>\n<p>It's easy to see why one might make that connection. Although GLP-1s have been <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7042958/#:~:text=\">used for nearly two decades</a> in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, their use for obesity only took off more recently. In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772342/\">approved</a> a GLP-1 agonist named Saxenda specifically for this purpose. Then in the late 2010s, a GLP-1 drug named Ozempic, made from the active ingredient semaglutide, began to be <a href=\"https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals-dropdown/topics/diabetes-and-insulin/ozempic-users-with-diabetes-have-decreased-over-time-indicating-increased-off-label-use\">used off-label</a>. The FDA also <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014\">authorized</a> Wegovy, another semaglutide-based GLP-1 medication, explicitly for weight loss in 2021.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/obesity-rates-are-down-is-that-because-of-weight-loss-drugs/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/obesity-rates-are-down-is-that-because-of-weight-loss-drugs/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Joshua Cohen, Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8e35f81f0e466052a62179174d31085d38f752cb71852ec7a3978bd4ef16bc6","category":"Tech"}
