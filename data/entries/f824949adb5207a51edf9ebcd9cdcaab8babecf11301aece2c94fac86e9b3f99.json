Fortunately, Apple has integrated a hidden feature in the virtual keyboard that can make this task much easier. Here's how to unlock and utilize this powerful tool to streamline your text editing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iphone-hidden-trackpad-tip.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe next time you are writing something a little more lengthy and need to go back and change something, simply long-press the space bar, and the on-screen keyboard will transform into a trackpad that you can use to control the cursor. This allows you to navigate quickly through your text, moving the cursor to any desired spot with ease.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut that's not all. If you tap the trackpad with another finger while in this mode, you can also select chunks of text. This dual-functionality makes editing and tweaking text on your iPhone a breeze. Give it a try next time you're typing a message or note.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/hidden-trackpad.jpg\" alt=\"notes\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\nIf you're looking to cut down on the amount of time you spend performing certain actions on your iPhone, there's usually a solution hidden in Apple's mobile operating system.
