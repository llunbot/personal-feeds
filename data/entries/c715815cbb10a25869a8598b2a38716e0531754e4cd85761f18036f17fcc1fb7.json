He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in the regular iPhone 17 model by May. Even if the base-model iPhone 17 sticks with 8GB of RAM, Kuo said he expects all models in next year's iPhone 18 lineup to have 12GB of RAM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCurrently, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/all-iphone-16-models-have-8gb-ram/\">all iPhone 16 models come with 8GB of RAM</a>, so going to 12GB would be a major increase. More RAM enables larger and more capable AI models to run locally, improving the speed, responsiveness, and complexity of tasks without relying heavily on cloud services. A fifty percent increase in allocable RAM would also allow for smoother multitasking, with AI processes operating in the background without slowing down active apps. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 17 lineup around its usual September timeframe. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/all-iphone-17-models-feature-12gb-of-ram/\">All iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature 12GB of RAM</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphone-17-models-again-rumored-to-feature-12gb-of-ram.2456153/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c715815cbb10a25869a8598b2a38716e0531754e4cd85761f18036f17fcc1fb7","category":"Apple"}
