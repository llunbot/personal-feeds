The added colors would be Deep Violet and Golden Brown, both of which Apple has offered in the past. Existing color options for the case include Umber, Forest Green, Ink, Midnight, and Orange.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDeep Violet was a color option for the iPhone 12 series of Leather Cases, while Golden Brown remains an option for the iPhone 13 series of Leather Cases. Apple also offered the iPhone Leather Wallet and AirTag Leather Key Ring in Golden Brown.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has recycled iPhone case colors in the past, so this rumor is plausible. For example, one of the current iPhone 14 Leather Case color options is Forest Green, which was previously available for the iPhone 11 Leather Case. Majin Bu has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/05/iphone-14-case-color-options-leak/\">accurately leaked</a> some iPhone case colors in the past, although their track record is not perfect.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced new spring color options for iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands on Tuesday, March 8 last year, so new color options could be announced as early as this week if Apple sticks to the same schedule this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">Yellow edition of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a> could be announced around the same time as the new cases and bands.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-cases/\">iPhone Cases</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14\">iPhone 14 (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14-Pro\">iPhone 14 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/iphone-14-cases-new-colors-soon-rumor/\">iPhone 14 Cases Rumored to Launch in New Colors Soon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-cases-rumored-to-launch-in-new-colors-soon.2382845/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df5801fc87a1def567392433ec2b3ba9947597b301e29b0b1a5b00226ced5538","category":"Apple"}
