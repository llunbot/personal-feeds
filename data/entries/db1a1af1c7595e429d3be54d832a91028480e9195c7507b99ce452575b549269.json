{"title":"‘The Shamans and the Chieftain’","link":"https://snyder.substack.com/p/a-short-course-in-the-rule-of-law","date":1718310729000,"content":"\n<p>Timothy Snyder:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The political theory of Trump’s coup attempt is that all that\nmatters is the chieftain. He does not have to win an election,\nbecause the chieftain has the right to rule simply because he is\nthe chieftain. Requiring Trump to win an election is thus a\nprovocation. The claim that he should leave office when he loses\nan election justifies revenge. And of course retribution is\nTrump’s platform.</p>\n\n<p>The legal theory of Trump’s coup attempt, made explicit in\nargument before the Supreme Court, is that the chieftain is immune\nto law. There is magic around the chieftain’s person, such that he\nneed respond only to himself. The words “presidential immunity”\nare an incantation directed to people in black robes,\nsummoning them to act as the chieftain’s shamans and confirm his\nmagical status.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No issue has ever been more important in the history of the United States, and thus, in the history of democracy itself: Donald Trump lost the election in 2020 and tried, ham-fistedly, to spearhead a coup to remain in power by overthrowing the duly elected government of the nation. If he gets another chance by winning in November, the next coup won’t be as ham-fisted.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/13/the-shamans-and-the-chieftain\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"db1a1af1c7595e429d3be54d832a91028480e9195c7507b99ce452575b549269","category":"Tech"}
