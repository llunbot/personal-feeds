And to keep subscriptions high, Amazon also \"did not provide simple mechanisms for these subscribers to cancel their Prime memberships,\" the FTC alleged. Instead, Amazon forced \"consumers intending to cancel to navigate a four-page, six-click, fifteen-option cancellation process.\"</p>\n<p>In their motion to dismiss, Amazon outright disputed these characterizations of its business, insisting its enrollment process was clear, its cancellation process was simple, and none of its executives could be held responsible for failing to fix these processes when \"accidental\" sign-ups became widespread. Amazon defended its current practices, arguing that some of its Prime disclosures \"align with practices that the FTC encourages in its guidance documents.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027607#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027607&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e7d27189508359bfa68b856765e5fc7a65310a82919fb780f7583febff0aead","category":"Tech"}
