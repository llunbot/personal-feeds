The move comes just two months after Microsoft similarly <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-this-is-your-reminder-that-xbox-game-pass-price-is-rising-tomorrow\">raised prices on its Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>\n<p>The new prices take effect September 6 and, Sony's Adam Michel, director of content acquisition and operations, says the increase will \"enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits\" to Plus subscribers. If you have a current multi-month subscription, the new prices won't take effect until your next renewal data that occurs after November 6. Making any changes to your plan after September 6, however, will incur the new pricing. That gives subscribers about a week's time to stick another year or more onto their membership at current pricing.</p>\n<p>PlayStation Plus' new prices are $80 per year for Essential (formerly $60), $135 for Extra (from $100), and $160 for Premium (from $120). All of these prices are notably below <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?xr=shellnav#join\">Microsoft's Game Pass prices</a>, though Microsoft makes its first-party games, like the upcoming <em>Starfield</em>, available on day one through that service, and only Sony's Premium plan offers the kind of large library of games that compares to Game Pass. PlayStation Plus is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/breaking-down-sonys-confusing-playstation-plus-subscription-relaunch/\">not an easy subscription to understand</a>—so much so that we were compelled to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/we-made-a-playstation-plus-explainer-thats-better-than-sonys/\">make our own explainer</a>—but the company has been clear that it's not planning to put its own games on its own service at launch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964413#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964413&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"edab736cbc689be3cd6965440d8551a358e31db376775aa1e2247c27bf5c14b7","category":"Tech"}
