I was intoxicated by graph paper. The\nemptiness of a totally blank page intimidated me by demanding that\nI make the first move, but graph paper invited my participation by\nsteering my pencil in the grooves of its strictly regular lines.\nThe grid was like a friend who had already done half the work for\nme. I drew mazes, maps, patterns, plans — all held by the\nsturdiness of the grid. The effect was soothing. Through the\ngrid’s lattice, all my drawings, no matter how primitive, took on\nan air of rational certainty.</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time that my dad showed me the grid map game, I\nstarted using a computer. In our house, down the carpeted stairs,\nin the basement, there was a light wood desk, upon which sat a\nbeige plastic box with a rainbow striped Apple logo on the front:\nthe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7500\">Power Macintosh</a>. Through this machine’s chunky, low\nres monitor, I witnessed a grid come to life. Each pixel was a\nmodular, addressable component in a digital whole. The windows,\nthe buttons, the fonts, the menus, and the icons — oh, the icons!\nThe world of the computer was filled with little hieroglyphic\npictures representing folders, files, control panels, and drawing\ntools, each crisply rendered on the pixel grid of the screen. The\nlogic and aesthetic of the grid permeated the virtual world of the\ncomputer — all rational, all peaceful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This essay hit close to home. As a kid, I too was obsessed both with graph paper and computers, and intuited a deep connection between the two.
