{"title":"Forget the iMac Pro–this Black Friday sale is even better for hundreds less","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2535396/forget-the-imac-pro-this-black-friday-sale-is-even-better-for-hundreds-less.html","date":1732698000000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since Apple retired the 27-inch iMac in 2022, we’ve been waiting for it to return. But as that day seems less and less likely to arrive, this Black Friday combo deal is the next best thing: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBV145M/\">Amazon is slashing $110 off the M4 Mac mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3GZD32\">$300 off the Studio Display</a> for a bargain total price of $2,190.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 Mac mini here has the same chip, RAM (24GB), and storage (512GB) as the high-end iMac and a larger 5K Retina display. Plus you’ll get more ports: three Thunderbolt, two USB-C, Ethernet, and HDMI on the Mac mini, and one Thunderbolt and three USB-C on the Studio Display. You’ll also get a 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage as well as a six-speaker audio system with Spatial Audio. (If you want a Studio Display with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3HMZW5/\">height-adjustable stand</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3HP4KL/\">nano-texture glass</a>, those models are available for $300 off as well.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you won’t get a keyboard or mouse, but you will get an incredibly small computer that’s compact enough to fit right on the foot of the Studio Display. The new Mac mini is Apple’s smallest design ever and just a couple of inches bigger than an Apple TV. Connected to a Studio Display, it’s the closest thing to an iMac Pro we’re likely to get until sometime in 2026, so if you’ve been longing for a larger iMac, grab this bundle and get the next best thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more Apple deals check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/apple-black-friday-week-deals-2024.html\">roundup of the best Black Friday sales</a> on Macs, AirPods, iPads, and more.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"65f24adfd0b2c4031f15512c24bd0a5537daaf6ca7a155f1b557884526950c6f","category":"Apple"}
