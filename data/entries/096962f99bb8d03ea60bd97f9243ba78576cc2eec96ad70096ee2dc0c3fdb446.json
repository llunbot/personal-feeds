Going into the 2021 <a href=\"/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>, their last win of any consequence was Jasper Stuyven's Milan-San Remo victory back in March.</p>\n<p>They really should have done better than second and third on the Mont Ventoux stage through the week after having three riders in the break.</p>\n<p>This time, though, Bauke Mollema was not to be denied, producing a 40km solo time-trial to distance some of the most talented riders in the race and win Stage 14 into Quillan yesterday.</p>\n<p>In truth this was always going to be a day for a breakaway success. A hilly profile ruled out a bunch sprint finish, and with the Pyrenees looming most of the GC favourites were happy to keep their powder dry for now.</p>\n<p>No surprise, then, that there was some serious riding talent in the 13-man break. Aside from Mollema, there was the likes of Michael Woods, Esteban Chaves, Guillaume Martin, Sergio Higuita and Patrik Konrad all eyeing up a potential win.</p>\n<div>      <div>See relatedÂ </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/6834/how-much-did-tadej-pogacar-earn-for-winning-the-tour-de-france-and-how-does-that\">How much did Tadej Pogacar earn for winning the Tour de France and how does that compare to other sports?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9899/gallery-van-aert-writes-his-own-champs-elysees-fairytale\">Gallery: Van Aert writes his own Champs Elysees fairytale</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9013/is-the-new-exciting-ineos-grenadiers-here-to-stay\">Is the new exciting Ineos Grenadiers here to stay?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 116: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nWhich made Mollema's decisive move all the more impressive. He quickly built a lead of a minute over the rest of the break, and maintained it all the way to the line.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Guillaume Martin's efforts in joining the break saw him rise all the way to second in the overall standings, with a disinterested peloton ceding all of 5 and a half minutes to the Frenchman.</p>\n<p>He'll have his work cut out to stay there over four hard stages in the Pyrenees starting with today's stage into Andorra. And with Tadej Pogacar still four minutes clear in the yellow jersey and riding imperiously, the 2021 Tour remains the Slovenian's to lose.</p>\n<p>Here are the pick of Cyclist photographer Chris Auld's images from the day's stage:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9865/tour-de-france-2021-stage-14-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 33</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_14_photos_01.jpg?itok=97016eKs\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>33</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9865/tour-de-france-2021-stage-14-gallery\">Tour de France 2021 Stage 14 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>11 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9865%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2014%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9865%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2014%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9865%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%2014%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9865%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9865/tour-de-france-2021-stage-14-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 33</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_2021_stage_14_photos_01.jpg?itok=97016eKs\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"096962f99bb8d03ea60bd97f9243ba78576cc2eec96ad70096ee2dc0c3fdb446","category":"Cycling"}
