It’s been four years since Apple silicon was introduced, so as WWDC arrives each year with its unveiling of the new version of macOS, users wait to see if the Intel Mac they use will be on the compatibility list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2366862-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia-preview/#:~:text=macOS%20Sequoia%20is%C2%A0compatible%20with%20these%20devices.\">macOS Sequoia compatibility list on Apple’s website</a>. But it lists Macs by the model year, not whether it has Intel or Apple silicon. To help you figure it out, here’s the list of Intel-based Macs compatible with macOS Sequoia listed by release year and Model Identifier. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Mac model</th><th>Release year</th><th>Model Identifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>MacBook Ai</strong>r</td><td>2020</td><td>MacBookAir9,1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MacBook Pr</strong>o</td><td>2018, 2019, 2020</td><td>MacBookPro15,1<br />MacBookPro15,2<br />MacBookPro15,3<br />MacBookPro15,4<br />MacBookPro16,1<br />MacBookPro16,2<br />MacBookPro16,3<br />MacBookPro16,4</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini</td><td>2018</td><td>Macmini8,1</td></tr><tr><td>iMac</td><td>2019, 2020</td><td>iMac19,1<br />iMac19,2<br />iMac20,1<br />iMac20,2</td></tr><tr><td>iMac Pro</td><td>2017</td><td>iMacPro1,1</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Pro</td><td>2019</td><td>MacPro7,1</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we have one model from 2017, the iMac Pro that started at $4,999 and was something of a stop-gap between the cylindrical Mac Pro and modular tower. Otherwise, it’s likely the last year of support for the 2018 Mac mini and 2019 iMac, leaving at most a handful of intel laptops able to support macOS 16. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out the Model Identifier of your Mac, go to <em>Applications</em> &gt; <em>Utilities</em> and launch the System Information app. Then select <em>Hardware</em> at the very top of the left column, and look for <em>Model Identifier</em> in the main window. If you can’t find the Model Identifier, open <em>About this Mac</em> and you should see the year the Mac was released–use that info to check. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671943/what-mac-do-i-have.html\">Learn more about how to identify your Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>Will my Intel Mac run macOS Sequoia iPhone Mirroring?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2364295/macos-15-sequoia-iphone-mirroring-connecting-devices.html\">iPhone Mirroring</a> is a new feature in macOS Sequoia where your Mac and iPhone connect wirelessly and you can see your iPhone on the Mac display and use it.
