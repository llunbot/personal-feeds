Now, when you tap the equals sign a second time, the Calculator app repeats the last mathematical operation. This functionality is useful for calculating compound interest or other repeat operations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Black Unity</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-2025-Black-Unity-Collection.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn honor of Black History Month this February, Apple today unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/2025-apple-watch-black-unity-band/\">new Black Unity Collection</a>, consisting of a special-edition Black Unity Sport Loop for the Apple Watch, a Unity Rhythm watch face, and matching iPhone and iPad wallpapers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Black Unity Sport Loop is available to order today, and the watch face and wallpapers will be available in the upcoming iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and watchOS 11.3 software updates, according to the band's product page.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.3 fixes these two bugs related to Siri and Apple Music:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>Fixes an issue where the keyboard might disappear when initiating a typed Siri request</li>\r<br />\n<li>Resolves an issue where audio playback continues until the song ends even after closing Apple Music</li></ul>Apple also added references to robot vacuum support in the Home app to iOS 18.3's code, but it seems this functionality never went live.
