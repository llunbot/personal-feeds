The sleek crankarms are made with laser-welded titanium to create a hollow arm that’s both light and durable. The arms also feature a SRAM 8-bolt chainring interface, making them compatible with Quarq power meters, SRAM 1x and 2x chainrings, and 5DEV’s own aero rings. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV-SPIDER_01.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV-SPIDER_01.png\" alt=\"5DEV 8 bolt spider for Shimano Dura Ace 2x chainrings on SRAM 8bolt cranks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV-SPIDER_01.png 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV-SPIDER_01-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV-SPIDER_01-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV-SPIDER_01-768x768.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0119.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"895\" height=\"954\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0119.webp\" alt=\"5DEV 8 bolt spider for Shimano Dura Ace 2x chainrings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0119.webp 895w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0119-281x300.webp 281w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0119-113x120.webp 113w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0119-768x819.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you want to run Shimano chainrings? Well, they hinted that a Shimano 2x compatible spider was in the works, and it’s finally here. The interesting bit is that while the spider allows you to use Shimano rings on the 5DEV cranks, it should also be compatible with most 8-Bolt cranks meaning you could use this spider to run Shimano rings on a SRAM 8-Bolt crankset if you found the need. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV_Spider_CarbonTi.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV_Spider_CarbonTi.png\" alt=\"5DEV 8 bolt spider for Shimano Dura Ace 2x chainrings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV_Spider_CarbonTi.png 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV_Spider_CarbonTi-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV_Spider_CarbonTi-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5DEV_Spider_CarbonTi-768x768.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The spider works with Shimano Dura Ace 2x rings, so it appears that it will also work with chainrings with the same bolt pattern like these from Carbon Ti</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Made in house, the spider is machined from aluminum and weighs in at 73g. The spider uses the Shimano 4-bolt 110BCD mounting standard for Dura Ace 2x rings only – this will not work with Ultegra or GRX. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spider sells for $179.99 and is available now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://5dev.com/collections/5dev-road-gravel/products/5dev-8-bolt-spider-shimano-dura-ace\" target=\"_blank\"><em>5dev.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/5dev-8-bolt-spider-dura-ace-2x-rings-ti-8-bolt-cranks/\">5DEV 8 Bolt Spider Mounts Dura Ace 2x Rings on Their Ti + Other 8-Bolt Cranks</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8045fb55b1d9fcac832000ce91617a35f2d9e3a787d8bbd383950894ed975d92","category":"Cycling"}
