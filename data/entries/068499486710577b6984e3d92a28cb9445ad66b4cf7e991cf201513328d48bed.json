Apple today also released iOS 15.7.8,\niPadOS 15.7.8, macOS Monterey 12.6.8, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.9 for\ndevices that are not able to run the current release versions of\nthe Mac, iPhone, and iPad software. These updates contain the same\nsecurity improvements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s thankless work producing these end-of-the-major-version updates, but kind of a shame that they go largely unheralded. Our attention is naturally drawn to the big new .0 updates that introduce major new features, but these .5/.6 updates tend to be the most stable and reliable releases.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/24/apple-os-updates\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"068499486710577b6984e3d92a28cb9445ad66b4cf7e991cf201513328d48bed","category":"Tech"}
