I know you’re busy, so let’s get to it. But before we talk about this 1990 Eisentraut Mountain Bike, how did you and Albert first meet?</b></p>\n<p>I look at Albert as the guy who passed the baton to Peter Johnson and me. As well as other builders. Early on, when Pete and I were racing and building and constantly trying to one-up each other by being competitive and feisty, we got in a car and drove up to Eisentraut’s shop.</p>\n<p>Just to drop in to see if he’d sell us some Columbus tubing and let us poke around his shop.</p>\n<p>It was a dingy, kind of dirty warehouse in Oakland. And wasn’t much in terms of the kind of image that you see these days. It was scrappy. What it did was it showed me at that age – and I think I was probably 16 – is that as shop could be scrappy and you could still put out very nice product.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1170\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut1.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut1.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut1.jpg?resize=768,1050&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut1.jpg?resize=1123,1536&amp;quality=75 1123w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1147\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut2.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut2.jpg?w=1147&amp;quality=75 1147w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut2.jpg?resize=768,1071&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut2.jpg?resize=1101,1536&amp;quality=75 1101w\" /></p>\n<p>I already had images in my mind of what shops looked like. A dirt floor shop in England or Italy and these other places you’d see in magazines. There was an occasional picture of some guy using a horizontal table and building a frame on a horizontal table.</p>\n<p>One of the first things I noticed about Albert is that he was building frames vertically. He was doing things the way I was doing it – how I had taught myself to do – so I was really pleased to see what I thought was a more intelligent, innovative, nontraditional way. He was doing it like I was, how it made sense for him to make a frame.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1133\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut3.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut3.jpg?w=1133&amp;quality=75 1133w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut3.jpg?resize=768,1085&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut3.jpg?resize=1088,1536&amp;quality=75 1088w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1135\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut4.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut4.jpg?w=1135&amp;quality=75 1135w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut4.jpg?resize=768,1083&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Eisentraut4.jpg?resize=1090,1536&amp;quality=75 1090w\" /></p>\n<p>Albert was an innovator of the vertical framebuilding jig that we’re accustomed to seeing now.</p>\n<p>At that time he must have been 20 years older than me and he he was very willing to show what he was doing to me and Pete and we kind of had our eyes opened to what true production looked like.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1162\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey1.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey1.jpg?w=1162&amp;quality=75 1162w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey1.jpg?resize=768,1057&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey1.jpg?resize=1116,1536&amp;quality=75 1116w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1135\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey2.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey2.jpg?w=1135&amp;quality=75 1135w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey2.jpg?resize=768,1083&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/87_10Ritchey2.jpg?resize=1090,1536&amp;quality=75 1090w\" /></p>\n<p><b>So, I guess I’m just curious.

The bottom bracket and chainstay yoke and the fork crown carry the same design language. And that’s to me, that’s what’s stood out the most about the bike was like, wow, this is an innovation made by a guy known for lugged construction, and it’s a mountain bike on top of that!</b></p>\n<p>Well, the investment cast thing was floating around a lot in the 80s. Italy was where the framebuilders discovered investment casting. I visited Columbus tubing in 1983, and Antonio knew that I was really interested in investment casting because that was another way to solve problems in a different way. You could unlock solutions to unique problems in bike designs. Do you know where he took me to show where the Italians learned how to design investment casting?</p>\n<p><b>Where?</b></p>\n<p>The Beretta gun factory.</p>\n<p>It was one of these cold winter days; we drove up to… I forgot the name of the town! <em>(Editor’s insert: Gardone)</em></p>\n<p>Anyway, it was north of Milan, in the lower foothills of the Alps. We were looking at these gun castings, and in the mix, I began to notice all these lugs. And I recognized them! They were lugs used by Gios, Masi, and others. The Italian bike industry retooled this technology to another level of frame building that didn’t exist when I started out in the early 1970s.</p>\n<p><em>(Editor’s insert: Beretta later wholly adopted CNC manufacturing, actually buying a CAD/CAM/CIM machining company, MI-VAL, in 1976 before implementing the technology into its production in the mid-1980s. Beretta still owns MI-VAL.)</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Early-1990s-Eisentraut-MTB-18.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Early-1990s-Eisentraut-MTB-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Early-1990s-Eisentraut-MTB-18.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Early-1990s-Eisentraut-MTB-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Early-1990s-Eisentraut-MTB-18.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, back in Oakland. Outside of Albert’s shop’s backdoor – in an industrial area – there was a precision casting company.</p>\n<p>And the shop was more than happy to work with bike people. This all happened at a pivotal time with the construction of mountain bikes. We were all looking at our choices. Ritchey used no lugs, Bridgestone and the Japanese were using lugs. And then there was the Italians, who didn’t want anything to do with the mountain bike.</p>\n<p>To the Italians, it was sacrilegious almost for them to put one ounce of credibility or interest in the mountain bike. And the only guy who did was Antonio.

It was revolutionary. 1985, I believe. I think it was called the Masi Criterium. <em>(Editor’s note, it was the <a href=\"https://www.italiansteelbike.com/masi-3v-volumetrica-campagnolo-chorus-excell-steel-tubing-made-italy-vigorelli/\" target=\"_blank\">1984 Masi 3V Volumetrica</a> – above).</em></p>\n<p>You’d look at the bike and go, where’s the lugs? This was where the whole world of cycling was going. Masi, to their credit, took a big, huge leap. They oversized the tubes and made them a little thinner and then used these hidden investment cast lugs. The Italians were jumping into all kinds of new things at that point in time.</p>\n<p><b>So in the early 1990s, Albert built this frame, combining technologies developed by the Italians, marrying investment cast yokes, with tig-welding, and in a lot of ways, prototyping what could have been a mass-produced model in 1990s mountain bike designs.
