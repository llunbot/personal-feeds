For years, her family has vacationed on the tiny Caribbean Island every July.

The collection comprises 101,376 items so far—roughly one for each person who lives on the Island—including 40,000 documents, 60,000 images, and seven 3D objects.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015705#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015705&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6dd0d661def0196a6d360499b4579dea237404043b1335a6b2813d8a26a239a0","category":"Tech"}
