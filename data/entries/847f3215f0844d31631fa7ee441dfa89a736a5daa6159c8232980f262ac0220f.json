His ability to not take himself or cycling too seriously is refreshing to me. I like his whole deal, from his bike’s aesthetics to his actual philosophy on riding and cycling culture. His ability to take all of it and apply it to the unique products he’s been having made and selling through <a href=\"https://ronsbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ron’s Bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://ultradynamico.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultradynamico</a> has been fun to watch as it grows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A while ago I wrote a piece on Ron’s new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rons-bikes-x-stomp-lox-wide-toe-box-spd-shoe/\" target=\"_blank\">cycling shoe collaboration</a> with Stomp Lox. The SPD-compatible bicycle shoe was called Slack. It was a cycling shoe that sported a nice alternative look when compared to a typical cycling shoe. Plus it looked like it had a nice, wide-toe box… I really dug the looks of it and wanted to try a pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Ron wasn’t able to send over a pair of the brown top grain model for me to review but was able to introduce me to Mamyia at Stomp Lox Japan directly to get a pair of the olive suede style sent over to me to try out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Slack Bicycle Shoe tongue lable\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-tongue-lable.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

Ron’s Bikes version has the LeRon Tulip label on the tongue and comes with brass hardware. The version of the Slack that I got directly from Stomp Lox is made in China, and doesn’t have brass hardware, or the tulip label, and only comes in black suede or olive suede. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Slack Out of the Box</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-getting-the-box-e1686611282537.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"572\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-getting-the-box-e1686611282537-800x572.jpeg\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Slack Bicycle Shoe getting the box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-getting-the-box-e1686611282537-800x572.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-getting-the-box-e1686611282537-297x212.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-getting-the-box-e1686611282537-120x86.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-getting-the-box-e1686611282537-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-getting-the-box-e1686611282537.jpeg 963w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

I was surprised that the shoes didn’t come with a rubber “block” or cover for the cleat area, in case you didn’t want to use them to clip in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slack is made of durable genius suede cow leather for the outside of the upper and uses a breathable, wear-resistant pigskin on the inside. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-brand-new-Vibram-sole-e1686611436711.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-brand-new-Vibram-sole-e1686611436711-800x798.jpeg\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Slack Bicycle Shoe brand new Vibram sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-brand-new-Vibram-sole-e1686611436711-800x798.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-brand-new-Vibram-sole-e1686611436711-297x296.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-brand-new-Vibram-sole-e1686611436711-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-brand-new-Vibram-sole-e1686611436711-768x766.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-brand-new-Vibram-sole-e1686611436711.jpeg 963w\" /></a><figcaption>Vibram sole.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These shoes are compatible with any 2-bolt cleat system, come with cleat plates, and are pre-laced and ready to roll. The Vibram sole seems to be a nice touch and looks thick and durable. The suede is not waterproof and Stomp Lox suggests that they should be sprayed with waterproofing spray before use.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-new.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1062\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-new-800x1062.jpeg\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Slack Bicycle Shoe new\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-new-800x1062.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-new-226x300.jpeg 226w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-new-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-new-768x1020.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-new.jpeg 964w\" /></a><figcaption>Durable genius suede cow leather upper. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I received the Slacks way back in February and have finally gotten through some other reviews and was able to slip these on and take them for a first ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Slack’s First Few Rides</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-on-the-Gus.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-on-the-Gus-800x603.jpeg\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Slack Bicycle Shoe on the Gus\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-on-the-Gus-800x603.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-on-the-Gus-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-on-the-Gus-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-on-the-Gus-768x578.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-on-the-Gus.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Slacks in action! </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that attracted me to these shoes, besides their looks, (I love the way they look like they just walked off the <a href=\"https://www.dolomites.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dolomites</a> circa 1966), was the wide-toe box and laces. I honestly hate the way most cycling shoes feel on my feet. It’s one of the reasons I had switched to flat pedals, after 25+ years of riding clipping in</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The traditional cycling shoe is like everything else the bike industry offers in wearable goods, they seem to be made with only smaller individuals, who race, in mind. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side-800x533.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-from-the-side.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Slack Bicycle Shoe underside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-underside.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slack has a medium stiff sole which has proven good for on or off-the-bike walking as well as the few hike-a-bike sections I have in my riding area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ordered the USA 11, and the fit seems pretty true to size.

Stomp Lox says the Vibram sole is also replaceable.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon my initial impression and the first few rides, the shoes checked all of the boxes for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re comfy right out of the box, they have a great non-traditional look to them, they’re made with quality material and they have laces, which I feel are infinitely more adjustable than other fastening systems for varying foot sizes and needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stomp Lox Slack Bicycle Shoe black chrome\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stomp-Lox-Slack-Bicycle-Shoe-black-chrome.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Again, no brass hardware.
