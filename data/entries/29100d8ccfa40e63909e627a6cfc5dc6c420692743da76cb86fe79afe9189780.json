These issues certainly affected his career and emotional state, so much so that Beethoven requested—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiligenstadt_Testament\">via a letter</a> addressed to his brothers—that his favorite physician examine his body after his death to determine the cause of all his suffering.</p>\n<p>Nearly two centuries after the composer's demise, scientists say they have sequenced his genome based on preserved locks of hair. While the analysis of that genome failed to pinpoint a definitive cause of Beethoven's hearing loss or chronic digestive problems, he did have numerous risk factors for liver disease and was infected with hepatitis B, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00181-1\">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. The researchers also found genetic evidence that somewhere in the Beethoven paternal line, an ancestor had an extramarital affair.</p>\n<p>“We cannot say definitely what killed Beethoven, but we can now at least confirm the presence of significant heritable risk and an infection with hepatitis B virus,” <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/982785\">said co-author Johannes Krause</a>, an expert in ancient DNA at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology. “We can also eliminate several other less plausible genetic causes.” The fully sequenced genome will be made publicly available so other researchers can have access to conduct future studies.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925141#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925141&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"29100d8ccfa40e63909e627a6cfc5dc6c420692743da76cb86fe79afe9189780","category":"Tech"}
