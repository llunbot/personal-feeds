The company released another trailer on Monday, and while new footage is in short supply, everything we've seen thus far is finally put into useful context.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/matrix-resurrections-trailer-is-sheer-perfection-both-fresh-and-familiar/\">first trailer</a> was released in September and was set to Jefferson Airplane's \"White Rabbit\" to drive home the red pill/blue pill theme. We saw Neo in therapy with a smarmy psychiatrist played by Neil Patrick Harris, and it soon became clear that we were in a brave new Matrix-constructed world. People take two blue pills daily, and everyone is glued to their iPhones and tablets—whatever it takes to keep the masses sedated.</p>\n<p>Last week's trailer <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/new-trailer-for-the-matrix-resurrections-is-heavy-on-the-deja-vu/\">was aptly titled</a> \"Déjà Vu\" since it riffed on that key moment from the first Matrix film when Neo saw the same black cat walk past a doorway in the Lafayette Hotel. We learned that the entire preceding \"reality\"—i.e., the events of the original trilogy—had been changed, but not many other details were revealed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818330#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818330&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e19b39660bc7879ecc8f6bbdfcaa14f3609bcf40f2e511ad57be7a25b124a68","category":"Tech"}
