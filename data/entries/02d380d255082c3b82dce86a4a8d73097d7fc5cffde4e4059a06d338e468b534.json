An electric 500e arrived after the gasoline models, but as then-CEO Sergio Marchionne was quick to point out, that was only to satisfy California's zero-emission vehicle mandate.</p>\n<p>Now the 500e is back, once again later than the European version (which was first shown in 2020), but this time, Fiat is skipping the gasoline engines for the line. The 2024 Fiat 500e is no compliance car—it's now the only version of this retro hatchback you can get and the only Fiat model available in the US—nor is it a mass-market item.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015720#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015720&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"02d380d255082c3b82dce86a4a8d73097d7fc5cffde4e4059a06d338e468b534","category":"Tech"}
