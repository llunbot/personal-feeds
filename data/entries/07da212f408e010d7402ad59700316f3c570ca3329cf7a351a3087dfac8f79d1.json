I’m fortunate enough to have had the all-at-once experience multiple times in my life, but it has its drawbacks. Our relationships with our bikes change over time. We may suddenly discover a new place to ride, or slowly abandon an old one.</p>\n<p>We may get on a racing kick after being roped into a local Tuesday-night summer series, until the novelty wears off or life gets in the way. Of course, parts can always be changed. That’s why they call them “parts.” But it’s risky to spend a bunch of money all in one go on a build that was chosen largely on speculation.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Trust-linkage-mtb-fork-bikepacking-bike-hack-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Trust-linkage-mtb-fork-bikepacking-bike-hack-8.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Trust-linkage-mtb-fork-bikepacking-bike-hack-8.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Trust-linkage-mtb-fork-bikepacking-bike-hack-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/custom-bikepacking-seatpost-rack-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/custom-bikepacking-seatpost-rack-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/custom-bikepacking-seatpost-rack-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/custom-bikepacking-seatpost-rack-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That’s why I’ve been enjoying the now year-long process of building my ideal bikepacking mountain bike. It started with the Marin San Quentin that I used for my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-hacks-trust-message-linkage-fork-bikepacking/\" target=\"_blank\">Trust linkage-fork rack experiment</a>. Then it turns out I missed having rear suspension, so I bought the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/giant-trance-29-2-review/\">Giant Trance 29 I reviewed</a>, and ported over the parts. That’s the bike <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/custom-bikepacking-seatpost-rack-souvenir-cycles\" target=\"_blank\">my custom rear rack</a> was built for. It’s still very much a work in progress, though. I’ve got some drivetrain decisions to make, my handlebar isn’t quite right, and I’m already rethinking that whole front rack thing. But I’ve got one part on lock. Or I guess, two parts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>What Do I Mean By “Bikepacking Wheelset?”</h3>\n<p>I built my bikepacking wheelset from the inside out to meet the needs of a casual bikepacker. “Casual,” meaning one who isn’t in a hurry. I value traction and comfort over speed and efficiency. Longevity over lightweight. But I’m also accustomed to certain modern perks. I like quick-engaging hubs and asymmetric rims and low-durometer rubber. So, here’s what I came up with.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Hubs: <a href=\"https://www.dtswiss.com/en/wheels/wheels-technology/ratchet-deg-technology\" target=\"_blank\">DT Swiss 240 DEG</a><br />\nRear: $465.90<br />\nFront: $229.90</h3>\n<p>There’s a bit of a nostalgia factor here. Back in 1996, my first set of boutique hubs were branded with the name, Hügi, whose Star-Ratchet design made them more resilient to the torque a then-young trials rider was capable of putting out. Spoke-maker, DT, acquired Hügi in 1995, and the Star-Ratchet concept would eventually gain a wide foothold in OEM spec. But there was a limit to how quickly a Star-Ratchet system could engage, so DT introduced a larger-diameter version they call DEG. It’s the same, simple, serviceable concept. Just bigger and faster, with more room for more teeth. There’s a bit more drag when coasting, but on a fully loaded bike, it’s not even a drop in the bucket.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-deg-ratchet-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-deg-ratchet-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-deg-ratchet-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-deg-ratchet-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-25.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-25.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I really appreciate the quick engagement when I’m sciencing out slow, technical terrain. Sure, there are quicker hubs, but I like the peace of mind that there are essentially three components to the DEG ratchet system: Two plates, and one spring. They’re extremely easy to replace or re-lubricate. And they’re also not as obnoxiously loud as other high-engagement hubs out there. I get the obsession with noisy hubs, but I like to be a bit more low-key on long rides.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-09.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-09.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-09.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-09.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Also low-key is an often ignored feature on some RockShox forks called “Torque Caps.” Many years ago, when Fox sold us on the logical but flawed pitch that a 15 mm x 100 mm front thru-axle would be lighter than the existing 20 mm x 110 mm standard, we lost a bit of valuable fork stiffness. RockShox has clawed some of it back with their “Torque Caps.”</p>\n<p>Most of their high-end fork dropouts offer the option of using larger-diameter hub end caps to increase the surface-area contact between hub and fork. DT is one of the hub manufacturers who offers Torque Caps. In a fascinating twist, I learned my Trust linkage fork works with Torque Caps, so that’s how the front hub is set up right now.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Spokes: <a href=\"https://www.dtswiss.com/en/components/spokes-and-nipples/spokes/dt-champion\">DT Swiss Champion 2.0 Black</a><br />\nApproximately $2 Each</h3>\n<p>Some slightly more recent nostalgia played a role in my choice of DT Swiss Champion 2.0 spokes for this build. In my shop days, we had an old wooden shelf full of long, thin boxes like Ollivander’s Wand Shop in Diagon Alley. But our boxes were filled with J-bend Champion spokes. There are much fancier spokes out there, and plenty of brands on the scene. But I’ve laced literally thousands of Champion 2.0 spokes over the decades, and it gave me peace of mind to lace another 64 of them for my bikepacking wheelset. Plus, I just can’t stray from a classic. Except for the nipples, where I went a little wild.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-22.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Nipples: <a href=\"https://www.dtswiss.com/en/components/spokes-and-nipples/nipples/dt-squorx\">DT Swiss Squorx Pro Lock Brass</a><br />\nApproximately $0.25 Each</h3>\n<p>Please forgive the lack of authentic build-process photos in this story. I’m not in the habit of making excuses, but I was careless with the memory card those photos were on, and there’s no saving it. Good news is, I have a box of Squorx nipples (aluminum this time) set aside for a future wheel-build, along with the special tool used to drive them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-19.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-19.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-18.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-18.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If you’ve laced wheels before, especially at a shop, you’ve probably used a nipple driver. It’s a quick way to catch the first few threads as you assemble the wheel before you start tensioning it. But traditional nipple drivers are not meant to handle any amount of torque, so you have to switch to a spoke wrench when that time comes. But DT’s Squorx system is a sort of reverse Torx-style interface, where instead of a flathead-screwdriver head, the top of each nipple has a star-shaped protrusion that fits into their custom driver.</p>\n<p>It’s a really minor thing, especially when this is the first wheelset I’ve built in over two years, but it’s really nice to be able to seamlessly transition from dishing to removing hops to tensioning without changing tools or body position. And you can still use a normal spoke wrench after the tire is installed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-prolock-spokes-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-prolock-spokes-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-prolock-spokes-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DT-swiss-prolock-spokes-bikepacking-wheelset.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Then, <i>inside</i> these nipples is DT’s Pro Lock treatment. It’s a dual-compound coating that activates when building a wheel that helps prevent spokes from loosening. I do my best throughout the tensioning process to pre-stress the spokes before the final true, but they still can stretch over time. If that happens, or when you need a re-true, Pro Lock isn’t permanent. You don’t need a heat gun or anything. They’ll work like normal. Though after several months, the tension is still within spec. And given the rims, I doubt I’ll need to true them any time soon.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Rims: <a href=\"https://www.ibiscycles.com/wheels/details/?wheelset=114104\">Ibis Blackbird Send 1 and Send 2</a><br />\n$99 Each</h3>\n<p>Ibis has an underrated rim lineup. Their carbon wheelsets were some of the first to do front- and rear-specific shapes and tensions. Their alloy wheels feature the same, but a recent addition to the lineup has a bit more going on. The Ibis Blackbird Send rims are some of the most advanced aluminum options out there. They’re aggressively asymmetric, so the tension specs from Ibis are very similar between the left- and right-side spokes. And they’re quite shallow, which at least in my head makes them more compliant. But they’ve also got a fascinating feature that, as far as I know, is totally unprecedented.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-24.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-24.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-23.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-23.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The bead walls are hollow. It’s a bit of a secret on how Ibis extruded such tiny tubular structures, but it’s really cool. It’s also really smart. One of the reasons I usually like carbon rims is that the bead walls can be extremely wide without being unreasonably heavy. This helps a lot if you bottom out your tire on a rock. Not only are wide bead walls less likely to crack or bend, they also create a wider surface to distribute the impact, potentially minimizing the risk of a pinch-flat. And there’s even more support.</p>\n<p>The rear rim gets a couple extra vertical walls in there for a burlier overall structure. I’m sorta burying the lead here, though. Because you probably noticed that these rims are very wide. Although Ibis specs these on bikes with 2.4” rear tires, I prefer the rounder profile that a 30 mm rim offers when paired with moderate-width tires. But I’m not using moderate-width tires.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Tires: <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/products/honcho-tire?srsltid=AfmBOorT0FTzi19x9p5XmGPypEEIsvJgbixv4eVv9ALMA-iiDkeVjsJ4\">Teravail Honcho 29×2.6 Durable</a><br />\n$75 Each</h3>\n<p>Like many mountain bikers, I went through a brief plus-sized phase about six or seven years ago. It was fun while it lasted, but I eventually got tired of the squirm. And to make a 3.0” or even 2.8” tire hold up to the rocks in my region, they’d have to be unpleasantly heavy. So, when 2.6” tires had their moment, I thought I’d found the perfect compromise. But there still was some lingering squirm. Eventually, the sheer number of choices in 2.4” and 2.5” tires brought me back to the mainstream.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>But my bikepacking gear choices are not mainstream. I’m not really schralping out there. I just want something that’s soft, safe, and comfortable. I wanted a moderately knobby tread pattern and a moderately thick casing. And I wanted it in a 2.6. It’s no surprise that I found what I wanted from Terravail.</p>\n<p>They already make my go-to touring tire, the efficient but overbuilt Sparwood. The Honcho model I chose for my bikepacking wheelset is clearly mountain-bike-focused, but the tread is not as deep or sparse as the Maxxis tires on my daily-driver trail bike. If I up the pressure a bit, they ride a lot like a 2.4” Maxxis Rekon. But when I’ve got technical terrain to manage, I drop the pressure a bit and get a taste of the sure-footedness I had back in the plus-size days.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2-perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As in the plus-sized days, I was faced with a durability trade-off. If I really wanted an ultimate durability-to-weight ratio, I’d maybe get a 2.3” Maxxis Aggressor with their Double Down casing. But that’s about the same weight as this tire (around 1,200 grams), and I wouldn’t get the floatation of the Honcho in Teravail’s slightly less-burly Durable casing.</p>\n<p>It did cost me a sidewall slice a few weeks ago that was small enough that I’d bet an enduro-casing tire might have survived unscathed. But it was an opportunity for me to document the process of successfully and <em>permanently</em> repairing a gash with needle and thread, but that’s a story for another post.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>All told, my dream bikepacking wheelset adds up to $1,171.80. That’s for Swiss-made hubs, Swiss/USA-made spokes, and some really unique rims and tires. Not bad for something truly custom, even if you have to pay a shop to build them. An off-the-shelf DT Swiss XM 1700 wheelset with a modern set of tubeless tires will add up to about $1,250. Sure, there are more affordable options out there. Plus, I guess these a bit heavy at about 3,330 grams with tires (but no rotors or cassette).</p>\n<p>But I still wouldn’t change a thing. Then again, my routes are not your routes. Everyone has different priorities. I don’t normally end my reviews like this, but I’m curious if anyone else has made equally specific choices when building a touring or bikepacking wheelset. Tell us about your own dream wheels in the comments. Unlike <em>actual</em> dreams, I swear nobody will get bored hearing about them.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/perfect-bikepacking-wheelset-dt-swiss-ibis-teravail/\">Dream Weaver: Building the Perfect Bikepacking Wheelset with DT Swiss, Ibis, and Teravail</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"07da212f408e010d7402ad59700316f3c570ca3329cf7a351a3087dfac8f79d1","category":"Cycling"}
