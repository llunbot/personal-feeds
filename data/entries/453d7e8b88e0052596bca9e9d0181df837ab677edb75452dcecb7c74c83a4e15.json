{"title":"Clear as Mud","link":"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1086","date":1745457816000,"content":"\n<p>From the European Commission’s announcement today, “Commission closes investigation into Apple’s user choice obligations and issues preliminary findings on rules for alternative apps under the Digital Markets Act”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Under the DMA, Apple is required to allow for the distribution of\napps on its iOS operating system by means other than through the\nApple App Store. In practical terms, this means that Apple should\nallow third party app stores on iOS and apps to be downloaded to\nthe iPhone directly from the web.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple failed to\ncomply with this obligation in view of the conditions it imposes\non app (and app store) developers. Developers wanting to use\nalternative app distribution channels on iOS are disincentivised\nfrom doing so as this requires them to opt for business terms\nwhich include a new fee (Apple’s Core Technology Fee). Apple also\nintroduced overly strict eligibility requirements, hampering\ndevelopers’ ability to distribute their apps through alternative\nchannels. Finally, Apple makes it overly burdensome and confusing\nfor end users to install apps when using such alternative app\ndistribution channels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So is the entire idea of the Core Technology Fee disallowed? Or is the fee too high? Does Apple need to just make app distribution free and unfettered, no fees, no restrictions?</p>\n\n<p>Who knows? The fine is clear — €500M — but what exactly Apple did wrong and should change now is not.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/23/ec-clear-as-mud\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"453d7e8b88e0052596bca9e9d0181df837ab677edb75452dcecb7c74c83a4e15","category":"Tech"}
