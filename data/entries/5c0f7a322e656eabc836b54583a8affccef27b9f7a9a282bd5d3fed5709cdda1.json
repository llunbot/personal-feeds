There’s less risk of ice than on the road, and it’ll help build and maintain your fitness alongside more technical mountain biking. Plus, if you’re going to end up filthy riding on the road, you might as well embrace it with the fun of mud off-road too.</p>\n<p>Yet if the thought of riding through the winter fills you with dread, there might be a few things you can do to help get your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bike</a> winter-ready, making your cold and wet-weather rides much more enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>Why winterise your gravel bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Portland Design Works metal fenders on a steel gravel bike\" title=\"Portland Design Works metal fenders on a steel gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Don’t let foul weather put you off riding your gravel bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Portland Design Works</i></span></div>\n<p>Anyone who has ridden their gravel bike from the gloriously dusty summer months into the dark, wet and cold of winter will tell you how beneficial it can be to make a few tweaks to your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-setup/\">gravel bike setup</a>.</p>\n<p>Though they all work in different ways, these changes are designed to take the sting out of winter. They’ll help make sloppy trails grippy again, keep you dry even when the gravel tracks are not, ensure you’re seen and can see in low-light conditions, and reduce the risk of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-repair-tubeless-puncture/\">punctures</a> you’d rather not be fixing in the wet and cold.</p>\n<h2>Tyre choice</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hutchinson Tundra winter gravel tyre\" title=\"Hutchinson Tundra winter gravel tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Winter gravel tyres are designed to cope with the rigours of foul-weather riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sam Voaden</i></span></div>\n<p>As your sole contact with the ground, be that gravel, tarmac, rock, grass, mud or hard-pack, your tyres do the heavy lifting when it comes to how well your bike performs off-road. For most riders, conditions change wildly from summer to winter, so it makes perfect sense that you’ll need to change your tyres too.</p>\n<p>Heading into the winter, look for tyres with deeper tread featuring larger, more aggressive knobs across the centre and shoulders for improved grip in muddier conditions. More closely packed knobs along the centre line help to maintain speed on linking tarmac.</p>\n<p>Look out for siping on the tread blocks, which helps the tyres clear water more easily. If you’re planning on tackling a lot of mud, widely spaced tread blocks can help shed it more easily.</p>\n<p>With many more gravel tyres on the market these days, a lot of brands offer a winter-ready option.

Not to mention the embarrassment of leaving a butt-shaped muddy print on cafe chairs.</p>\n<p>Fitting your gravel bike with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-mudguards/\">mudguards</a> can prevent the worst of the road spray and trail dirt covering not only you, but also your bike and your ride pals.</p>\n<p>There are largely three types of mudguards suitable for gravel bikes.</p>\n<p>The most minimal option is a set of short-coverage clip-on guards, such as the Mudhugger Gravel Hugger guards, which can be fitted to almost any bike.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum, full-length long-coverage fixed mudguards are more akin to traditional road cycling mudguards, though wider and fixed to the bike using the frame and fork eyelets.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in-between, for riders seeking greater coverage, but without frame and fork mounts, clip-on long-coverage mudguards are a good option.</p>\n<p>Greater coverage options offer more protection, keeping both your face, feet and rear end drier and mud-free, as well as whoever is riding right behind you.</p>\n<h2>Lights</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The bikes ship with Supernova lights fitted as standard.\" title=\"Desiknio X20 Gravel - South Downs Sep 22-248\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Don’t underestimate the importance of lights when it comes to winter riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Deskinio</i></span></div>\n<p>Making sure you’re seen or lighting up the way ahead, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">bike lights</a> are crucial for keeping safe when it comes to the darker months.</p>\n<p>It’s worth investing in a good set of lights – front and rear – if you haven’t already, even if you plan on riding predominantly during daylight hours.</p>\n<p>Murky, low-light conditions can reduce visibility, so using lights when on the road, even during the day, is a very wise idea.</p>\n<p>If you’re riding on gravel tracks in the woods, you might be surprised how dark it can be, even during the day, so a front light can help you see the trail ahead more clearly.</p>\n<p>Don’t get caught short without your lights if you’re delayed on your ride and end up cycling at dusk. Good charging discipline is key, too.</p>\n<h2>Tubeless tyre setup</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Topping up tubeless sealant in tyre with a jug\" title=\"tubeless sealant in tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubeless setup and maintenance can be a bit messy, but worthwhile.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jonny Ashelford / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Nobody wants to spend half an hour wrangling with a puncture in foul weather conditions and miles from the nearest road, so anything you can do to beef up your tyre setup for the winter is well worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Some gravel tyre brands offer options with additional puncture resistance, but the real game-changer here is going <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have any little punctures from thorns or other sharp objects, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">tubeless sealant</a> can plug the hole, often before you’ve even noticed there’s been a puncture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-set-up-a-tubeless-tyre/\">Tubeless setup</a> can take a little practice (or help from your trusted mechanic), but can save you a lot of hassle in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Extra baggage</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wizard Works Framebagracadabra\" title=\"ORG_DSC00129\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A small bag, such as a half-frame bag, can be invaluable for carrying extra layers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Evans / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With more changeable weather conditions, you’re more likely to need more kit.
