That change would potentially ameliorate concerns that <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/16hgmqm/unity_wants_108_of_our_gross_revenue/\">some developers could literally bankrupt themselves</a> with games that generate lots of installs but relatively little revenue per player under the currently proposed fee structure.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg's report suggests this limit would apply to \"customers making over $1 million,\" and it's not clear how smaller games and developers would be impacted by the potential change. For comparison, Epic's Unreal Engine currently <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/unreal-engine-is-now-royalty-free-until-a-game-makes-a-whopping-1-mill/\">charges a flat 5 percent royalty on all developer revenue after the first $1 million</a> from studios using the engine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969103#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969103&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b87b06f2415af1d00da0cb9f636cec0a41b3eae120ee1ab8a0e337d605c623d5","category":"Tech"}
