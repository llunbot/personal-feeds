And their Roll-Top Trunk Bag perfectly fits on top, too. They’re designed to work well on any standard pannier rack system, too, but both brands were on board to support this trip, so we put them to the test. Here’s what we used…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-1.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-1.webp\" alt=\"north st bikepacking bags on lauf road bikes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-1.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-1-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Lauf Uthald road bikes were equipped with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2Fcollections%2Fbike-panniers%2Fproducts%2Fadventure-micro-pannier-21l\">Adventure Macro Pannier</a> (21L, two per bike) – $140 ea.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2Fproducts%2Froll-top-trunk-bag\">Roll-Top Trunk Bag </a>– $120</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2Fproducts%2Ffuel-pouch\">Fuel Pouch</a> – $45</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2Fcollections%2Fbike-handlebar-bags%2Fproducts%2Fhandlebar-pack\">Handlebar Pack</a> – $95</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2Fproducts%2Fnorth-st-tool-roll\">Tool Roll</a> – $30</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F247825%2Fold-man-mountain-divide-rack\">Old Man Mountain Divide Rack</a> – $168</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://robertaxleproject.com/\">Robert Axle Project 12mm thru-axle fit kit</a> – $68</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Total to outfit each bike as shown is $806.

This setup is ideal because it increases the load capacity from 55lbs to 70lbs, and Old Man Mountain’s website has a comprehensive “Fit Kit Finder” that gets you the right axle for any bike made, guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RAP &amp; OMM are sister companies, so all parts are 100% cross-compatible and the Divide rack is made to fit perfectly on their axle supports. The rack works front or rear, and they make thru axle fit kits for both forks and frames. It’s a solid rack, and I highly recommend it as it’ll fit virtually any bike out there – road, gravel, mountain, fat, whatever. OK, on to the bags…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>North St. Pannier &amp; Trunk Bags</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-9.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-9.webp\" alt=\"cyclist in japan with north st bikepacking pannier bags.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-9.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-9-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-9-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-9-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-9-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>North St.’s Adventure Panniers come in two sizes – <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2Fcollections%2Fbike-panniers%2Fproducts%2Fadventure-micro-pannier-14l\">Micro</a> (14L) and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2Fcollections%2Fbike-panniers%2Fproducts%2Fadventure-micro-pannier-21l\">Macro</a> (21L). I always opt for the larger because I always overpack. But also, it’s good to have room for stuff you pick up along the way…like food. Also, the 21L’s capacity is measured when fully open – it only has 15L capacity when fully rolled shut. Go big, trust me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-6.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1181\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-6.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of north st bikepacking pannier and trunk bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-6.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-6-297x195.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-6-1536x1008.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-6-120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-6-768x504.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The Adventure Macro could easily hold a 14″ laptop or tablet in case you have to work from the road.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bags attach to the racks with Velcro straps on the top and a hooked strap on the bottom that loops through the rack and clips back onto the bag. This allows for a wider range of adjustment, but does take a few extra seconds to finagle through the slots on the rack. Once installed, it’s rock solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice those trunk bags sagging and shifting a bit? That’s because we didn’t install the included plastic sleeves that create structure and support. And that’s because we didn’t read the instructions. So, entirely our fault. Once home, I installed them and the bags sit much more upright and self assured. Definitely do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-5.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-5.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of north st bikepacking pannier and trunk bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-5.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-5-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-5-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-5-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-5-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>D-ring attachments make it easy to add a shoulder strap to any of these bags.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I mostly love these bags, and I’ll explain why below. But first, there are two things I wish it had. First, none of these have a rear light clip, which is a major oversight IMO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were able to clip our taillights to the roll-top’s closure strap, but depending on how tightly it was twisted (and in which direction), the light could either jiggle around or be aimed askew. It took work to get it aimed straight back, which is particularly important if you’re using a radar-equipped light like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-enters-the-radar-game-with-carback-bike-radar/\">Trek’s excellent Car Back</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-8.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-8.webp\" alt=\"cyclist in japan with north st bikepacking pannier bags.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-8.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-8-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-8-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-8-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-8-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, there are no reflective elements on it. Great for stealth missions in the woods, but not great for riding on the road. Some of the tunnels we rode through were pitch black…we had lights (obvi), but reflective thread or panels are great, cheap insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having them isn’t a dealbreaker for these otherwise excellent bags, but I’d recommend adding your own reflective elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SIDE NOTE: North St.’s commuter-oriented packs DO have these features. Founder Curtis says they weren’t in high demand for bikepacking users as much, but they may be offering it in the future, either as a standard feature or option.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-2.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-2.webp\" alt=\"bikepacking tent and sleeping gear inside the north st pannier bag.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-2.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bags come in anywhere from 5 to 11 colors on the outside, letting you mix or match. Inside is bright yellow, making it easier to find stuff. The outside material is “waterproof” sailcloth, which we found to be mostly waterproof. We rode through a few rainy days, some rainier than others, and the material did “wet out” a little in spots, to the point where it looked like it was soaked. That said, the seams aren’t taped or sealed, and North St. only claims that they are “highly water resistant.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, everything remained dry, so unless you’re always riding in the rain, it works. The zippers are waterproof, too, and if I wanted total repellency, I could easily wax them. The material is tough, with nary a scratch even with us leaning and dropping our bikes on all manner of surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-1.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-1.webp\" alt=\"random bikepacking and cycling gear laid out for a trip.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-1.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-1-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We split our loads between the panniers, putting sleeping gear and half of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-sea-to-summit-bikepacking-tent-gear/\">Sea to Summit Telos Bikepacking TR2 tent</a> on one side…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1867\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3.webp\" alt=\"random bikepacking and cycling gear laid out for a trip.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3-289x300.webp 289w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3-1536x1593.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3-116x120.webp 116w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3-768x797.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-pannier-bag-contents-3-1481x1536.webp 1481w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…and clothing on the other.

Perfect for burritos, but a bit small for major multi-day outings. North St.’s Handlebar Pack is more lunch-box sized, with a convenient zippered pocket on the front and two small, open mesh pockets on the back that are great for gels, lip balm, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loop on the zippers makes them easy to find, grab, and open/close while riding. It also has D-ring loops, so you can add a strap to turn it into a cross bag, bum bag, hip pack, fanny pack, murse, purse, or whatever other variation you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-7.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-7.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of north st bikepacking handlebar bag straps.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-7.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-7-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-7-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-7-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-7-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with two VOLLE straps for mounting it to your bar, with multiple loops on the back of the bag so you can position them between your bar tape and around any accessories you have mounted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SIDE NOTES: We opted for a <a href=\"https://k-edge.com/products/boost-stem-mount\">K-Edge Boost Stem Mount</a> computer mount and bar-mounted light. As much as I love K-Edge’s out-front combo mounts, I didn’t want anything sticking out over the bag and hindering access to it while riding. This position for the computer worked great, but we had to remove the computer to access the <a href=\"https://granite-design.com/products/stash-rcx\" target=\"_blank\">Granite Design Stash RCX</a> tool hidden in the steerer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-3.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-3.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of north st bikepacking handlebar bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-3.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-3-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-3-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-3-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-3-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Handlebar Pack was most impacted by riding in the rain and was the only one that felt slightly damp inside after hours of wet riding, but still not soaked. Even so…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-handlebar-bag-contents.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-handlebar-bag-contents.webp\" alt=\"random bikepacking and cycling gear laid out for a trip.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-handlebar-bag-contents.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-handlebar-bag-contents-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-handlebar-bag-contents-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-handlebar-bag-contents-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-handlebar-bag-contents-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…I intentionally packed this one using Ziplock baggies for organization with the bonus idea that it would protect things from moisture. But mostly it was to keep small parts from jostling around and getting lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kept spare AXS batteries (including a spare CR2032 for the shifters), bike lights, a headlamp, tubes, brake pads, hand sanitizer, electrical tape, and various action camera mounts in here. I mostly rode with the Insta360 action cam on a handle stick shoved into my jersey or bib pockets for quick access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I brought the spare brake pads just in case the extra weight and extremely mountainous terrain burned through the stock pads quickly. Ended up not needing them, but it’s good insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>North St. Fuel Pouch</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-2.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-2.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of north st bikepacking top tube bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-2.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My son rode with his Fuel Pouch top-tube bag on the front, behind the stem, in its natural habitat. I needed something a bit bigger up front for additional action camera stuff, so I moved mine to the back and attached it around the seat tube. Both positions worked great, so you could double them up if you just carry a lot of small stuff but want to compartmentalize.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-top-tube-bag-contents.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-top-tube-bag-contents.webp\" alt=\"random bikepacking and cycling gear laid out for a trip.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-top-tube-bag-contents.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-top-tube-bag-contents-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-top-tube-bag-contents-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-top-tube-bag-contents-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-top-tube-bag-contents-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I kept my readers and lip balm in mine, and there was room to cram a few small snacks in there, too. It lacks the extra loop on the zipper, which sometimes meant a few extra seconds to find and grab it, particularly with full finger gloves on, so I may add one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>North St. Tool Roll</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-toll-roll-contents.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-toll-roll-contents.webp\" alt=\"random bikepacking and cycling gear laid out for a trip.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-toll-roll-contents.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-toll-roll-contents-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-toll-roll-contents-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-toll-roll-contents-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bags-review-toll-roll-contents-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tucked under my seat was their Tool Roll, which held Clever’s latest Flat Out tire lever combo tool, Anchor Stack tire plugger kit, and chainbreaker tool, plus extra plugs and a Presta-to-Schrader adapter. I brought three spare quick links, and two small things of wax chain lube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this was a snug fit, I <em>maaaaybe</em> could have wrapped it small enough with a road bike tube in it and still strapped it around my saddle rails, but for this trip I kept the tubes in the handlebar bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the diminutive size (or my propensity to overpack), I really like this bag. It held solid, something not every single-strap saddle bag does, and also works great as a basic small tool roll for organizing your stuff inside a hydration pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-10.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-10.webp\" alt=\"north st bikepacking bags on lauf road bikes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-10.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-10-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-10-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-10-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/north-st-bikepacking-bags-review-10-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun fact, in case you’re wondering, North St. is “North Street”, not “North State” (they’re based in Portland, OR, so I was curious).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bags performed flawlessly throughout our trip. I had to mount my panniers as far backward as possible to avoid kicking them with my heel. But otherwise, they all fit on the bike perfectly and remained rock solid even over rough gravel backroads and chunky descents. Which is saying something considering they’re mounted to a performance all-road bike like the Lauf Úthald, which was never designed with bikepacking in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bags are reasonably light, quite tough, and well-designed. They’re capable without being complicated, focusing on added space over added features. I highly recommend checking them out if you’re in the market for something with more room than a frame bag but still ready for adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26165&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthstbags.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">NorthStBags.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-north-st-bikepacking-bags-old-man-mountain-rack/\">Review: North St. Bikepacking Bags &amp; Old Man Mountain Rack</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1cb4c1a95a0771c0f5aea72da85144a8cc9ba527451160fa40f3669c14b1c0b6","category":"Cycling"}
