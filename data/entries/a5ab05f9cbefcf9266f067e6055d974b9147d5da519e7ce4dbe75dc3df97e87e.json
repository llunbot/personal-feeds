It's a useful way to change the focus of an image.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a Combine <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> Guided Edit that walks users through blending the subject from one image and the background from another to create an all-new image. It can use parts of multiple photos for unique looks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new features include options for textured photo backgrounds and graphics and a one-click option for adding effects like camera motion, animated sparkles, or an animated frame.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPremiere Elements 2025 has several new features for videos. There's a new White Balance tool for adjusting the look of clouds, snow, and similar white elements, plus there are new color correction Curves for making more precise color and brightness adjustments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/premiere-elements-change-color.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" />\r<br />\nThere are additional templates for dynamic titles with more control over text alignment, size, color, and spacing. There are preset LUTs for tweaking color, and a simplified Timeline speeds up editing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor both Photoshop and Premiere Elements, there are enhancements for Macs with the new M3 chip, so the software will run faster on new M3 machines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPhotoshop and Premiere Elements are priced at $100 each individually, with a bundle available for $150.
