The first of these will be in the London Boroughs of Hackney and Newham, with two coaches already recruited.</p>\n<p>The City Academy Clubs and Talent Centres meanwhile will support riders who want to move up to professional cycling via the British Cycling development pathway.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/rapha/9877/lachlan-morton-has-already-completed-his-alt-tour\">Lachlan Morton has already completed his Alt Tour</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9813/halfords-donates-wind-tunnel-to-british-cycling\">Halfords donates wind-tunnel to British Cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9473/improving-diversity-in-cycling\"> Improving diversity in cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 116: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nBritish Cycling CEO, Brian Facer, said, 'The British Cycling City Academies project is a key part of our wider strategy to make cycling more inclusive, more diverse and more reflective of our society.
