This time, they’re focused on the world of road and gravel with a new product line called SOLiX. Impressively, I9 claims this is their most technically advanced hub system to date – offering a massive 605 points of engagement!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Industry Nine SOLiX wheelset — What is it? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SOLiX line arrives in two wheelsets with different personalities. They have two distinct hubs and spoke configurations designed for road, gravel, or whatever you ride. Builds are customizable, but I9 puts them in two pathways: SOLiX SL and SOLiX G. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold--800x800.jpg\" alt=\"AR40 SOLiX Gold\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold--800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold--297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold--120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold--768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold--1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold--2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SOLiX SL is the race/lightweight focused of the bunch, and the SOLiX G is for the off-road adventurer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Freehub-face.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Freehub-face-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"SOLiX Freehub face\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Freehub-face-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Freehub-face-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Freehub-face-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Freehub-face-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Freehub-face.jpg 1502w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SOLiX wheelsets are both built around the i9s SOLiX hubset. The new hubset is a continuously-phased five-pawl freehub with a 121-tooth drive ring. It offers 605 contact points, translating to an ultra-fine .59° engagement. That’s not quite the 690 POE and 0.52º of the I9 Hydra hub system, but it’s far more than we typically see with gravel and road hubs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-14-at-9.29.10 AM.png\"><img width=\"595\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-14-at-9.29.10 AM.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-14-at-9.29.10 AM.png 595w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-14-at-9.29.10 AM-248x300.png 248w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-14-at-9.29.10 AM-99x120.png 99w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I9 has also has an all-new hubshell design meant to make the hubs more durable and faster when coasting. All of these pieces together add up to what they’re considering their most technologically advanced hub system yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>I9 SOLiX SL Wheelset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail-.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail--800x800.jpg\" alt=\"AR40 SOLiX Gold Detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail--800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail--297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail--120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail--768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail--1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AR40-SOLiX-Gold-Detail--2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SOLiX SL is the lighter and more road-focused wheel. According to the brand, the SL is the “highest-performing lightweight road and gravel race wheels from i9.” The new wheelset features a slew of high-end build features and a respectable weight of 1270g for the carbon rim build. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg-800x640.jpg\" alt=\"I9 AR40 SOLiX Gold jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg-800x640.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg-297x238.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg-120x96.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg-768x614.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-AR40-SOLiX-Gold-jpg-2048x1638.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes CFD-designed rims and straight-pull Sapim CX-Ray bladed spokes anchored in the lightweight, minimalist SOLiX hubs.

Why? The hooked rims permit higher tire pressures, mitigating blowoff risks associated with hookless rims and allowing for a lower bead wall height than hookless road rims. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AR40 rim features a 25mm internal width and a 35mm external width, providing a nice perch for tires ranging from 28mm to 34mm and offering aero advantages and an airfoil shape. I9 claims this design extends its aero benefits to tires up to 40mm wide, making it versatile for any terrain and tread choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design team at i9 created a 4mm wide bead wall to reduce the risk of pinch flats. This design hopes to disperse impact force over a broader area. Lastly, the high-impact strength of the layup is tailored for gravel applications, reinforcing the wheel’s ability to withstand impact forces and sustained abuse on rough roads and trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG-800x800.jpg\" alt=\"SOLiX Road Hubset HG\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Road-Hubset-HG-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--800x800.jpg\" alt=\"SOLiX Classic Hubset side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLiX-Classic-Hubset-side--2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>SOLiX Hubset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-solix-hub-pawl-phase.png\"><img width=\"597\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-solix-hub-pawl-phase.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-solix-hub-pawl-phase.png 597w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-solix-hub-pawl-phase-297x185.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/I9-solix-hub-pawl-phase-120x75.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of SOLiX Hubs is a continuously-phased five-pawl freehub seamlessly</p>\n\n\n\n<p>​integrating with a 121-tooth drive ring with a whopping 605 points of contact, translating to an ultra-fine .59° engagement.
