As a Whistler local, I’m familiar with the brand and intrigued to know they’re expanding their cycling-specific gear. I personally owned a Peak Performance puffy mid-layer jacket, which was great, and I know the brand is highly regarded by the hardcore winter athletes around here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peak Performance’s 2025 mountain biking collection includes new shorts and pants, liner shorts, plus long and short-sleeved trail shirts. While each piece features some Peak Performance branding, the garments are not flashy or bright colored, so they’ll likely appeal to those who like a more subtle kit. All items are available now in women’s and men’s versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trail MTB Shorts: $145</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash.webp\" alt=\"Peak Performance Trail MTB shorts, berm slash\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-MTB-shorts-slash-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Trail MTB Shorts are designed to be light and breathable, yet durable. The shorts are made from a 2-way stretch Polyamide/Elastane fabric, a good portion of which is recycled material. A DWR coating makes these shorts water-repellent.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail MTB shorts are cut to offer ample room for knee pads, and the leg length is extended in the front for full upper leg coverage. For storage, Peak Performance includes a zippered leg pocket with an internal mesh pocket to hold a smartphone, plus a hidden lift pass pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-MTB-short-full.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1368\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-MTB-short-full.webp\" alt=\"Peak Performance Trail MTB shorts, full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-MTB-short-full.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-MTB-short-full-263x300.webp 263w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-MTB-short-full-105x120.webp 105w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-MTB-short-full-768x876.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The adjustable waistband features elastic webbing with tension-locking side adjusters, and a double button and hook closure for a secure fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s models are available in Black, Blue Shadow, or Pine Needle colors. Sizes range from S-2XL. Women’s shorts come in Obscure (maroon), Avid Beige, or Black, with sizes ranging from XS-XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trail Tech Pants: $200</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm.webp\" alt=\"Peak Performance Trail Tech pants, rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-berm-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the shorts, the Trail Tech Pants are designed to be light and breathable yet tough. They use a similar 2-way stretch DWR-coated fabric, but the pants get Cordura reinforcements on the knees. These pants feature the same adjustable elastic webbing waistband and button and hook waist closure as the Trail MTB shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail Tech Pants offer a regular fit, and their articulated leg cut provides room for kneepads and tapers down to the lower hems. For your cargo, they include a zippered pocket on the right leg and a lift pass pocket on the left leg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-full.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1313\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-full.webp\" alt=\"Peak Performance Trail Tech pants, full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-full.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-full-274x300.webp 274w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-full-110x120.webp 110w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-Trail-Tech-pants-full-768x840.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s color options are Avid Beige/Black or Black.

Women’s models come in the same color options and in sizes XS-XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Padded Liner Shorts: $90</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-padded-liner-short.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1343\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-padded-liner-short.webp\" alt=\"Peak Performance MTB padded liner short\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-padded-liner-short.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-padded-liner-short-268x300.webp 268w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-padded-liner-short-107x120.webp 107w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-padded-liner-short-768x860.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Peak Performance’s Padded Liner Shorts are a lightweight pair of liners designed to keep you comfortable through long rides. An Elastic Interface comfort chamois offers a design intended for all-mountain or enduro riders with excellent shock absorption properties. The men’s and women’s models feature gender-specific chamois pads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shorts’ Polyamide/Elastane body material provides a medium support fit and 4-way stretch to ensure unrestricted movement. The fabric also dries quickly to help keep you cool and comfortable. Flatlock seams are used to reduce potential chafing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Padded Liner Short is available in Black only. Men’s sizes range from S-2XL, and women’s sizes are XS-XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trail Wool Blend Short/Long Sleeved Shirts: $100 (LS) $80 (SS)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS.webp\" alt=\"Peak Performance Trail wool blend ss\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peak-Performance-trail-shirt-SS-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The long and short-sleeved Trail Wool Blend shirts are made from a blend of 85% Polyester and 15% wool.
