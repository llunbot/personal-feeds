Both platforms provide automated services known as “liquidity pools” that allow users to move cryptocurrencies from one to another. The pools are funded with user-contributed cryptocurrency and are managed by smart contracts enforced by platform software.</p>\n<h2>“Formidable mathematical prowess”</h2>\n<p>The prosecutors said Andean Medjedovic, now 22 years old, exploited vulnerabilities in the KyberSwap and Indexed Finance smart contracts by using “manipulative trading practices.” In November 2023, he allegedly used hundreds of millions of dollars in borrowed cryptocurrency to cause artificial prices in the KyberSwap liquidity pools. According to the prosecutors, he then calculated precise combinations of trades that would induce the KyberSwap smart contract system—known as the AMM, or automated market makers—to “glitch,” as he wrote later.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/man-indicted-for-two-alleged-defi-hacks-that-stole-65-million/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/man-indicted-for-two-alleged-defi-hacks-that-stole-65-million/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3d48de604e405551e5406439919585cf41c846a366d17fe49a2a5b280a52d79c","category":"Tech"}
