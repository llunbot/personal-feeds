It now features a 64-degree head angle that wouldn’t be out of place in the current line-up of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Dallas-Murdoch has been making custom and modified bikes for five years, after originally taking up the brazing torch for connecting plumbing pipes. He soon taught himself how to build bike frames through trial and error, rather than any formal training.</p>\n<p>Dallas-Murdoch ended up reviving this GT LTS because he wanted to modify a retro mountain bike, but he says he found it difficult to find a classic 90s MTB due to their recent popularity.</p>\n<h2>Sustainable steel</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vandal Metal Works GT LTS.\" title=\"VANDAL METAL WORKS GT (13 of 13)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike features a new design, forward of the seat tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The GT LTS was available in two frame materials, with the top-end model made from aluminium and this entry-level frame from steel.</p>\n<p>“The good thing about steel in particular is that it’s so repairable,” says Dallas-Murdoch. “So long as it doesn’t turn to rust, this bike will be around forever.”</p>\n<p>Most of the modification on the bike has taken place in the front triangle, with everything from the seat tube forward being a new design.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rear shock linkage on The Vandal Metal Works GT LTS.\" title=\"VANDAL METAL WORKS GT (4 of 13)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It now has a hole in the top tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To get the desired 64-degree head angle, Dallas-Murdoch has brazed a horizontal tube onto the original top tube to join it to the front end.</p>\n<p>The seat angle has also steepened to 79 degrees, with Dallas-Murdoch saying this has given the bike a significant gain in climbing performance over the original GT LTS, despite the bike’s extra weight.</p>\n<h2>Extreme mullet</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Vandal Metal Works GT LTS.\" title=\"VANDAL METAL WORKS GT (1 of 13)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike pairs a 29in front wheel with a 26in rear wheel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This reimagined bike has a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet setup</a>, with a 29in wheel at the front and a 26in wheel at the rear, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/trek-69er-review/\">Trek 69er</a>.</p>\n<p>The rear triangle of the bike appears to stay true to the original GT LTS design, but it has been widened to accommodate modern Continental Trail King 2.4in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>Dallas-Murdoch says this is a large improvement on the bike’s original 2in tyres.</p>\n<h2>Snowflake spokes</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Front wheel and fork of The Vandal Metal Works GT LTS.\" title=\"VANDAL METAL WORKS GT (6 of 13)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dallas-Murdoch laced the front wheel’s spokes in a snowflake pattern.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As well as having an extreme mullet setup, the GT LTS also has hand-built wheels.</p>\n<p>The front wheel has a snowflake spoke pattern, which looks great, though Dallas-Murdoch says the design is more than just decorative.</p>\n<p>“People will complain about the snowflake spoke pattern because they say it’ll never be as strong as traditional methods.
