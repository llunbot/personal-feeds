The ‌iPad mini 7‌ isn't out just yet, but customers in Australia and New Zealand who pre-ordered will be getting their shipments in just a few hours, and they'll be able to update during the setup process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 18.0.1 includes a fix for an issue that could cause the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> to unexpectedly quit when replying to a message with a shared Apple Watch face, plus it has a security fix to address a vulnerability with the Passwords app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLaunch versions of the ‌iPad mini 7‌ have a version of iOS 18.0 installed rather than iPadOS 18.0.1, which is why there's an out-of-the-box update. Next week, ‌iPad mini 7‌ owners can also upgrade to iPadOS 18.1, an update that includes the first Apple Intelligence features.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/22/apple-releases-ipados-18-0-1-ipad-mini-7/\">Apple Releases iPadOS 18.0.1 for iPad Mini 7 Ahead of Tomorrow's Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ipados-18-0-1-for-ipad-mini-7-ahead-of-tomorrows-launch.2440711/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"516d6ed723ba9f50a8f9eeaacfe7ad67c975b8dc3a5189298ae6a75d7a56aa0c","category":"Apple"}
