Thus, citrus producers in the US have long planted 90 percent <i>Citrus sinensis. </i>But this cultivar is extremely susceptible to the bacteria that causes citrus greening disease, which has devastated the near-monocultural Florida crop. There is as yet no way to control the disease; the most effective way to deal with it would be to find citrus cultivars that are resistant to it and breed them with sweet orange to grant them disease resistance.</p>\n<p>Sweet oranges are a hybrid of mandarin and pomelo and are not especially genetically diverse. Any disease-resistant citrus we know of, however, does not taste like sweet orange, so breeding with it will produce fruit and juice with off flavors. It has been difficult to define and quantify those off flavors, though, because it has been difficult to define and quantify the components essential for proper orange flavor.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service performed a comprehensive chemical evaluation of 179 different citrus combinations—oranges, mandarins, and assorted hybrids—and cross-referenced their chemical compositions with evaluations of orange and mandarin flavors in juice samples performed by a “trained panel.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008717#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008717&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Diana Gitig","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ebd0a6a5cc2e4eefb79fd9956511e2db50ca04072002f40f3597a358cf5b6956","category":"Tech"}
