Featuring integration with the Unity editor, creators\ncan build experiences that run in visionOS, and leverage the\namazing features of Apple Vision Pro. By combining Unity’s new\nPolySpatial technology with Apple’s RealityKit-managed app\nrendering, content created in Unity will have a unified look and\nfeel, alongside other apps in visionOS. And Unity has worked\nclosely with Apple to offer support for visionOS and PolySpatial,\nso users can experience their favorite Unity apps on day one in\nall new spatial environments made possible by Apple Vision Pro.\nDevelopers interested in signing up for the beta can visit\n<a href=\"https://create.unity.com/spatial\">https://create.unity.com/spatial</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be a deep partnership between Apple and Unity. There were a couple of sessions at WWDC last month about Unity and VisionOS. It’s impossible to say what would’ve happened if <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/epic+v+apple\">Epic hadn’t chosen to go to war</a> against Apple with its Fortnite shenanigans, but given that they did, there’s pretty much zero chance Apple would integrate VisionOS with Epic’s Unreal Engine the way they are with Unreal.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/19/unity-visionos-beta\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e81afac07d13851f9b2006841961be4c29952321a54a04ddd1c17725b3a67b2f","category":"Tech"}
