The plan launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/ios-15-2-apple-music-voice-plan-video/\">as part of iOS 15.2</a> in December 2021 in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, and the U.K.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe primary way to subscribe to the Voice Plan was by asking Siri, and music playback was controlled via Siri too. While the plan provided access to the entire Apple Music catalog with over 100 million songs, it lacked some features available on more expensive plans, such as downloading, spatial audio, and Family Sharing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear why the Voice Plan was discontinued, or if existing subscribers to this plan will be able to continue using the plan indefinitely. We've reached out to Apple for comment and we'll update this story if we receive a response.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/apple-music-voice-plan-no-longer-available/\">Apple Music's Lower-Priced Voice Plan No Longer Available</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-musics-lower-priced-voice-plan-no-longer-available.2409543/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0b772a6f76d2d329b2d62a175c93e75290154f27362fa5562854738596255e2d","category":"Apple"}
