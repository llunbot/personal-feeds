This is despite the fact that iCloud syncing of Apple's own stock apps remains unaffected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis behavior is not made clear in Apple's user-facing settings, which confusingly include separate switches to turn iCloud on and off individually for iCloud Drive, system apps, and third-party apps. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMoreover, iCloud Drive can take a considerable amount of device storage, therefore some users may choose to disable it, without realizing that they are also preventing some third-party apps from syncing between their devices. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nBy making iCloud Drive and third-party app iCloud access configuration independent from one another in iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma, cloud management better reflects the Settings interface. It also means that users with company-issued devices where iCloud Drive is disabled as a matter of policy will still be able to use third-party apps that depend on iCloud syncing to function properly.\r<br />\n<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-drive/\">iCloud Drive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cloudkit/\">CloudKit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/icloud-drive-cloudkit-syncing-separate-ios-17/\">PSA: Disabling iCloud Drive in iOS 17 No Longer Turns Off Third-Party App CloudKit Syncing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-disabling-icloud-drive-in-ios-17-no-longer-turns-off-third-party-app-cloudkit-syncing.2392796/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d1c56eda549dd6d0d257b79af391b4b9f42bc4f95184f55d23ccc36fe01578da","category":"Apple"}
