It’s a 7.3km climb averaging 12.1%, but the first 4.9km average an horrendously-steep 15.3%; there’s even a 22% ramp towards the very top. It is not hyperbole to write that the time gaps between riders at the top of the GC could be several minutes. A failure to time one’s effort correctly, such as pushing too hard at the beginning, could lead to a blow out of seismic proportions, and it’s why Thomas’s 26 second advantage remains slender.</p>\n<p>Roglič took three seconds on the Briton on stage 19, counter-attacking the Ineos rider’s own attack moments earlier, and the Slovenian will go to bed on Friday night believing he can enact revenge on the cycling gods who so famously took away his Tour de France title in 2020 on the penultimate stage time trial. The Jumbo-Visma rider will also have home advantage, with thousands of Slovenians expected to make the short journey across the border for the epic denouement in the Julian Alps, a mountain range shared between Slovenia and Italy.</p>\n<p>But Thomas will not be fearful. For almost two decades he has been riding to power better than any other professional cyclist, winning golds on the track and Grand Tours on the road. The gradients may be evil, more akin to an elongated club hill-climb he might find in the autumn in the Brecon Beacons, but he knows what numbers he has to hit to ensure that he keeps hold of pink.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GM200336.jpg?v=1685136018\" alt /></p>\n<p>Being an individual time trial, he won’t be able to rely on his Ineos Grenadiers teammates who have shepherded him through the <em>Corsa Rosa</em> expertly, in particular Thymen Arensman and Laurens De Plus, a duo who remain seventh and 10th GC, respectively. The performance from Ineos has been a reminder of the British team’s stage racing dominance of yesteryear. On stage 19, won from the breakaway by Bahrain-Victorious’s Santiago Buitrago, Arensman manned the front of the peloton on the final two climbs like a seasoned pro; he is just 23.</p>\n<p>One year older than the Dutchman is Almeida in third, but he mustn't get too despondent with ceding time on the slopes of Tre Cime di Lavaredo. Tadej Pogačar was 57 seconds off Roglič in the 2020 Tour ahead of the final time trial and won with a gap of 59 seconds. That’s proof for Almeida that minutes can still be taken out of his rivals, and he rides for the UAE Team Emirates team where that magic stemmed from.</p>\n<p>A lot has been debated and discussed about how tedious this year’s Giro d’Italia has been, and there are growing calls for the organisers RCS to modify the race route, but as we approach the final weekend, they’ve got exactly what they wished for: the battle for pink hanging by a thread, set to be decided on the most thrilling and hellish of landscapes.</p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"ba654b52f9219a723a4a5d952321e368755abffa0ecb3d294ddf1d1ebe403135","category":"Cycling"}
