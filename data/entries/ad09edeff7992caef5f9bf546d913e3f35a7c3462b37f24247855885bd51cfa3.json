You’ve come to the right place.</p>\n<p>Buying a new suspension fork for your mountain bike is one of the priciest – and potentially most effective – <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mtb-upgrades/\">upgrades you can make to your mountain bike</a>. Even when buying a complete bike, the fork it comes with is a serious consideration.</p>\n<p>You’ll want either a suspension fork that irons out the harshest of trail feedback, helping your hands to last longer whatever bike you ride, or you’ll want the fork to sit smoothly into the first part of its travel to keep your front wheel stuck to the ground.</p>\n<p>You’ll also need enough stiffness to provide accurate and predictable steering, and enough adjustability to fine-tune the fork to your needs, but not so much that it’s a nightmare to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-set-up-your-mountain-bike-suspension-video-guides-to-help-you-get-the-most-from-your-bike/\">set up</a>.</p>\n<p>You’ll probably want it to be as light as possible too, and hopefully not cost the earth.</p>\n<p>We’ve tested forks to suit a broad range of budgets, making sure to include some top-shelf options because these are what people tend to buy as an upgrade to their bike.</p>\n<p>You can read our full <a href=\"#mtb-fork-buyers-guide\">mountain bike suspension forks buyer’s guide</a> at the end of this article.</p>\n\n<h2>Best mountain bike suspension forks of 2023</h2>\n<h3>RockShox SID Ultimate 3P</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 RockShox SID Ultimate 3P fork (with TwistLoc remote)\" title=\"2024 RockShox SID Ultimate 3P fork - RS SID Ultimate\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new RockShox SID Ultimate 3P impresses with supple and capable ride characteristics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,069/$999/€1,199 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel size/travel options</strong>: 110mm and 120mm (29in), 120mm tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 1,600g (29in x 120mm)</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Initially very sensitive;

Fortunately, it’s got performance to match.</p>\n<p>Its four-way adjustable damper has high- and low-speed adjustment for both compression and rebound damping. Fortunately, Fox nailed the setup guide, so it’s one of the easiest forks to get in the right ballpark despite the vast range of adjustments.</p>\n<p>It’s also one of the best performers, particularly over big holes and choppy unpredictable ground. The independent high-speed rebound adjustment seems to make it more controlled and calm when returning from deep in the stroke if, like us, you’re running a lot of pressure in the spring.</p>\n<p>It’s not quite as sensitive off the top of the stroke as its rival, the RockShox Lyrik, though, so there isn’t quite as much traction in low-load situations.</p>\n<p>While very active and supple over small bumps, it’s a little stingy with its travel over bigger impacts, even with the compression damping fully open. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but we would have liked the ability to run the high-speed compression a little more open for long-run comfort.</p>\n<p>There were situations where the 36 was the best fork we’ve ever used.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/fox-36-factory-grip2-fork-review/\">Read our full Fox 36 Factory GRIP2 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Manitou Mezzer Pro</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Manitou Mezzer mountain bike suspension fork\" title=\"Manitou Mezzer mountain bike suspension fork\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The fork’s performance really impressed our tester.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £899.99/$999.99/€1,050 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelsize/travel options:</strong> 27.5in and 29in (tested), both adjustable between 140 and 180mm in 10mm increments (160mm tested)</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 2,093g (29in x 160mm)</li>\n<li><strong>Pros: </strong>Very supple with great mid- and end-stroke support</li>\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Difficult to set up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mezzer is a surprise performer, offering an excellent balance between small-bump sensitivity and bottom-out resistance. It’s particularly capable no matter how deep into its travel you go or how hard you push it.</p>\n<p>The chassis also hits the perfect balance of control, accuracy and compliance, feeling stiff when it needs to – such as under corners – but didn’t cause our front wheel to bounce or judder offline, also helping to reduce hand fatigue.</p>\n<p>The MC2 damper’s high-speed compression is light enough to absorb fast impacts and proved to be incredibly supple. Its low-speed damping gives plenty of support through turns and compressions, adding to the capabilities of the impressive air spring.</p>\n<p>Although the air spring is quite hard to set up – and you need to follow the supplied guide exactly – once you get it right, the performance that’s unlocked is virtually unparalleled on the trail.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to upgrade your fork and were considering a RockShox Lyrik or Fox 36 GRIP2, the Mezzer has to be on your shortlist as well.</p>\n<p>The Manitou Mezzer wasn’t tested as a part of our latest fork group test, and doesn’t feature in our video, but was tested and rated to the same criteria, and performed exceptionally well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/manitou-mezzer-pro-fork-review/\">Read our full Manitou Mezzer Pro review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Marzocchi Bomber Z1</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Suspension fork for mountain bike\" title=\"Marzocchi Bomber Z1\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Marzocchi’s Bomber Z1.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £749 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel size/travel options</strong>: 27.5in with 130, 140, 150, 160, 170mm; 29in with 150, 160 (tested), 170, 180mm</li>\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>2,249g (29in x 160mm)</li>\n<li><strong>Pros: </strong>Comfortable with big-hit capabilities</li>\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Firm at the beginning of the stroke; heavy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Marzocchi is now a sister brand of Fox, and the Z1 shares a lot of features with the Fox 36. However, it’s designed to hit a lower price point.</p>\n<p>Because it uses a lower-grade aluminium in the upper tubes, it’s one of the heaviest enduro forks around at 2,249g, but the extra weight is not noticeable on the trail.</p>\n<p>The air-sprung Z1 isn’t as soft at the very start of its travel as the Fox 36, or the Yari and Lyrik, so it needs a lower air pressure to get it to sag properly, along with a healthy stack of volume spacers to stop it using all of its travel too easily.</p>\n<p>It still canters through the middle of its travel a bit more easily than those other forks too, making it feel a little less predictable and refined. The flipside is it swallows kerb-sized rocks like a champ, which means good long-run comfort.</p>\n<p>The key comparison is to the RockShox Yari (below). The Z1 is more willing to swallow large impacts, making it more forgiving in those big-hit scenarios, but the Yari is more supple at the start of the stroke, and offers more traction and more predictable support.

Heavier, stiffer forks are favoured by aggressive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro</a> riders, while lighter forks are popular amongst those riders who value weight savings and don’t require the extra rigidity of a heavier fork, such as XC riders.</p>\n<p>Long-travel trail and enduro forks achieve increased stiffness through an all-round beefier chassis, with thicker stanchion diameters (35-38mm) compared to short-travel forks, which commonly have smaller stanchions (32-34mm diameter).</p>\n<p>While the chassis often remains similar throughout the price range, the internals housed within vary greatly, with high-end options offering improved performance and tunability over their budget counterparts.</p>\n<h3>Do all suspension forks fit all bikes?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Lyrik Select+ on the Nukeproof Mega 290 Alloy Pro full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Nukeproof Mega 290 Alloy Pro 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Increasing fork travel can void your frame warranty, so have a look at the recommended travel for your frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Based on their intended use, mountain bike frames are designed with a specific suspension fork travel in mind.</p>\n<p>Retrofitting a longer or shorter-travel fork can have a big impact on a bike’s geometry, potentially putting excessive stress on the frame.

It is usually housed inside the left leg of the fork and can be an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">air spring or a coil spring</a>.</p>\n<p>Coil springs are linear, which means there’s a direct relationship between how much force it takes to compress the spring and how compressed the spring is. For example, a 200lb/in spring will take 200lb of force to compress one inch, 400lb to compress two inches, 600lb to compress three inches, and so on.</p>\n<p>They are also linear, meaning that no matter how deep it is in its travel, a coil spring will always compress the same amount under a given load.</p>\n<p>An air spring is a sealed cartridge with an internal piston that moves as the fork absorbs an impact, reducing the volume and increasing the pressure in the chamber. Air springs are progressive, meaning that the load required to compress them increases the deeper they sit into their travel.</p>\n<p>On modern mountain bikes, air-sprung forks are by far the more popular choice. They are a lot lighter than their coil counterparts and can be easily and accurately adjusted by raising or lowering the internal air pressure with a shock pump to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-set-up-your-mountain-bike-suspension-video-guides-to-help-you-get-the-most-from-your-bike/\">find the perfect setup</a>.</p>\n<p>Coil-sprung forks on the other hand can only be adjusted by swapping the coil for another with a heavier or lighter spring weight, which is both costly and time-consuming.</p>\n<h3>Straight steerer vs tapered steerer</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ohlins RXC34 m.1 carbon steerer tube csu\" title=\"New Ohlins RXC34 and TXCAir\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most modern frames will feature a tapered head tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jeff Thoren / Ohlins</i></span></div>\n<p>The steerer is the tube that connects the fork to the bike, fitting through the bike’s head tube before being clamped by the stem and top cap. There are two standards for suspension fork steerers.</p>\n<p>The old steerer standard featured a 1 ⅛-inch diameter from top to bottom. These are called straight steerers.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, tapered steerers have a 1.5in diameter at the bottom and taper to a 1 ⅛-inch diameter at the top. Most modern mountain bikes now feature this standard, which is claimed to improve stiffness between the frame and the fork.</p>\n<p>A couple of brands have strayed from these standards. Giant ran its Overdrive2 fork steerer system, which tapered from 1.5-1.2in for a number of years, and Cannondale (plus a few other small ebike brands) have run straight 1.5in steerer tubes.</p>\n<p>While few bikes deviate from the regular tapered standard, if you have a Giant or a Cannondale, it might be worth checking.</p>\n<p>If you have a bike with a tapered head tube, it is possible to fit an older fork with a straight steerer, providing you source an adaptor for the lower <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/#:~:text=The%20standard%20sizes%20are%201,are%2C%20however%2C%20quite%20common.\">headset cup</a>. Unfortunately, the same does not apply to fitting a new tapered fork to an older frame with a straight head tube.</p>\n<h3>Volume tokens/spacers</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bottomless Tokens\" title=\"tips-bottomless-tokens-08-1513171688412-m6w5di1gbyk1-4e3d2d2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tokens are usually supplied with new forks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jonny Ashelford / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Another benefit of air-sprung suspension forks is their ability to be tuned with volume spacers, sometimes called tokens. These spacers are an inexpensive way to tune the progression of your fork.</p>\n<p>By adding volume spacers, you effectively reduce the size of the fork’s internal air chamber, increasing the progressivity of the spring. This enables you to reduce your overall air pressure, increasing the fork’s sensitivity at the start of the stroke without compromising support and ramp-up deeper in the travel.</p>\n<p>By removing volume spacers, you can make your fork more linear. This is especially useful for lighter riders who are struggling to use all of their travel and bottom out their fork.</p>\n<h3>What are compression and rebound damping?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2023 RockShox Lyrik Ultimate and Super Deluxe Coil Ultimate mountain bike suspension fitted to a Marin Alpine Trail XR mountain bike ridden by Alex Evans\" title=\"2023 RockShox Lyrik Ultimate and Super Deluxe Coil Ultimate mountain bike suspension fitted to a Marin Alpine Trail XR mountain bike ridden by Alex Evans 3\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Without compression damping, the spring would be uncontrolled.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / RockShox</i></span></div>\n<p>Regardless of whether you have an air or coil spring, the spring itself does a fairly simple job – it absorbs an impact and then returns to its original position.</p>\n<p>However, without damping, it is essentially a pogo stick and not very good at delivering a controlled and predictable ride.</p>\n<p>This is where rebound and compression damping come into play. Usually housed in the right leg of the fork, the damper is adjusted by dials at the top and bottom of the fork leg.</p>\n<h4>Rebound damping</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2023 RockShox Lyrik Ultimate mountain bike suspension 13\" title=\"2023 RockShox Lyrik Ultimate mountain bike suspension 13\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rebound adjustment is usually found on the bottom of the left fork leg.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Rebound damping controls the speed at which the spring returns after absorbing an impact. Too fast and the fork will bounce uncontrollably. Too slow, and it won’t extend in time for the next impact, making for a very harsh ride and compromising grip.</p>\n<p>High-speed rebound damping controls how fast your fork will rebound from a big hit that uses most of the suspension travel, while low-speed rebound controls the speed through the rest of the travel.</p>\n<p>Luckily, rebound damping can be adjusted on most quality mountain bike forks. Adding rebound damping (often marked ‘+’ on the fork dial) slows down the return rate of the fork. Reducing rebound damping (often marked ‘-‘ on the fork dial) speeds up the return rate of the fork.</p>\n<h4>Low-speed compression damping</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Zeb Ultimate fork high speed and low speed compression adjustment\" title=\"RockShox Zeb Ultimate fork high speed and low speed compression adjustment\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most forks will feature low-speed compression adjustment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Low-speed compression (LSC) damping influences how the fork responds to impacts where the spring compresses slowly – think pushing into a take-off or around a berm.</p>\n<p>Adding low-speed damping makes the fork firmer in these instances, using less travel, and can make for a more supportive and stable-feeling fork at the cost of some sensitivity on small bumps.</p>\n<h4>High-speed compression damping</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Giant Trance X 1 full suspension mountain bike is equipped with a Fox 36 Performance Elite GRIP2 fork\" title=\"Giant Trance X 1 - Fork adjuster\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> High-speed compression can stop you from blowing through all your travel on heavy impacts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>High-speed compression (HSC) damping is usually only available on high-end forks. It influences how the fork responds to impacts that make the spring compress rapidly, such as sudden compressions and big hits.</p>\n<p>Adding high-speed compression damping helps to stop the fork blowing through all of its travel and bottoming out.</p>\n<h3>How do I know my fork size?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orbea oiz tyre wheel logo\" title=\"Orbea oiz tyre wheel logo\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s good to check the recommended travel for your frame before purchasing a new fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ross Bell / Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>When considering a fork upgrade, it’s important to know the travel and size of your current fork because replacing it with something outside your frame manufacturer’s parameters could void your warranty.</p>\n<p>Suspension travel is often displayed on the rear of the fork legs, just beneath where the stanchions meet the lowers. If this isn’t the case on your particular fork, you can find the serial number under the fork crown.</p>\n<p>The length of the stanchions can also be an indicator of how much travel a fork has. However, it isn’t always reliable because some forks don’t use their full stanchion when compressed.</p>\n<p>Another important measurement is the axle-to-crown distance. This is measured in a direct line from the fork crown to the axle.</p>\n<p>When measuring this distance, it’s important that the fork is unsagged, so make sure the stanchions are fully extended before you grab your tape measure.</p>","author":"Seb Stott","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ad09edeff7992caef5f9bf546d913e3f35a7c3462b37f24247855885bd51cfa3","category":"Cycling"}
