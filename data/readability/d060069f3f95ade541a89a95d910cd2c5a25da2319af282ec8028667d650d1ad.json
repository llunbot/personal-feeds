And not all winter cycling gloves are created equal! Here, we’re sharing our top picks—and some diehard winter rider favorites—that keep us pedaling no matter what the weather.</p><p>A quick note about our breakdown: Because there are all kinds of definitions of “cold weather” riding, we’ve broken this list into three unscientific categories:</p><ul><li>Light Winter – 35-45ºF range with maybe a bit of rain</li><li>Medium Winter – 25-35ºF range with a mix of snow or rain</li><li>Deep Winter – Regularly below freezing with plenty of precipitation</li></ul><p>You’ll find recommendations for both dry and wet cold weather conditions as well.

They can go from winter cycling in just-above-freezing temps to cross-country skiing and running in even chillier conditions, and they’re incredibly easy to handle with – no shifting or braking issues here.

They’re the perfect ‘throw in your gear bag as a backup’ pair of gloves, and super for working on your bike in the garage as well. Despite the utter simplicity of these gloves, they still have one of our most key features: they’re smartphone compatible, so you can actually text without freezing your fingers. Check their size chart though; You may want to size down one in these as the fingers are quite long.</p><p>The soft nylon/merino wool blend is super comfortable and makes them great on or off the bike,&nbsp;but they’re a bit stretchier than others here, so it may feel like your hands are slightly shifting inside them if you’re getting aggressive on the handlebars.

Glove sizing is truly the wild west, since each brand has its own standard of sizing. It’s imperative that you hunt down a size chart to find the best option for you, since gloves that are too tight or too big can make handling difficult. If you’re between sizes, though, opt for the larger size, as smaller sizes can end up decreasing your circulation. (Scroll down for more on sizing in our frequently asked questions section.)</p><p><strong>Check weather rating.</strong> Some gloves are billed as ‘winter’ or ‘cold weather,’ but as you can see above, the definition of winter varies wildly. Look at your local weather and average temperatures that you’re willing to ride in, and find a glove that’s comfortable in your range.</p><p><strong>Look at material</strong>. Avoid cotton as your interior layer, as it soaks up sweat and will turn your hands into prunes. Possibly <em>frozen</em> prunes. Vegans should pay attention for leather accents, since many winter gloves will use leather on the palms. Fabrics that use technology like GORE and Polartec are great for wind and water-proofing, and be on the lookout for DWR treatments, which make a glove water-resistant. For the liner, polyester or merino wool will help wick sweat and keep hands warm and dry.</p><p><strong>Check the features you want.</strong> Do you deal with wind and snow? Windproofing or extra lining will be more important than a waterproof layer. But if you tend to ride in more mild temps where you’re likely to get freezing rain, waterproofing is a top priority.</p><p><strong>Try them on in position</strong>. It might sound silly, but as you try your gloves on, before taking the tags off, try using them on your bike inside. Grip the bars, use the brakes, test your shifters. If you can’t brake or shift easily, or you don’t feel like your grip is solid, you may need a different pair.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08115747/45NRTH-LTR-Leather-Sturmfist-winter-cycling-gloves-Ophira-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08115747/45NRTH-LTR-Leather-Sturmfist-winter-cycling-gloves-Ophira-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08115747/45NRTH-LTR-Leather-Sturmfist-winter-cycling-gloves-Ophira-2.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08115747/45NRTH-LTR-Leather-Sturmfist-winter-cycling-gloves-Ophira-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08115747/45NRTH-LTR-Leather-Sturmfist-winter-cycling-gloves-Ophira-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08115747/45NRTH-LTR-Leather-Sturmfist-winter-cycling-gloves-Ophira-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08115747/45NRTH-LTR-Leather-Sturmfist-winter-cycling-gloves-Ophira-2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Winter Cycling Gloves</h2><p><strong>Why do I need cycling-specific winter gloves?<br></strong>While you technically can use a regular winter glove to ride a bike, we recommend using a cycling-specific glove. These gloves are designed for better handling and are specifically made to grip a set of handlebars while allowing you to shift and brake freely. They’ll also last longer than a regular winter glove, which rarely has a palm pad that can stand up to the rigors of rubbing on your handlebar constantly. The problem with using a soft-shell ski glove with a snowboarding shell, for example, is that the gloves are meant to get some airflow so they don’t get soggy, so that combo means they’ll get damp and stink, even if you’re good about pulling them apart after the ride.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>What features should I look for?</strong><br>In addition to things like waterproofing and windproofing, we like to look for few other features, too. A large terrycloth nose-wipe section on the index finger is key if you’re a heavy snotter (no judgment here). We also like some kind of smart phone enabled addition to the index finger so you can at least answer calls without taking gloves off. And of course, bonus features like padding for mountain bikers, electric heating elements for fat bikers, and little loops to help pull gloves on and off are great bonuses.</p><p>We also generally like longer cuffs, as it makes it easy to tuck under (or over) a jacket sleeve and prevent air gaps.</p><p><strong>How thick should my gloves be?</strong><br>Try to get the thinnest gloves you can for the temps you ride in. Thick fingers that are really thick can make it harder to shift because they’re mashing both buttons or levers, particularly on road bikes, thus taking more mental effort to get the shift right. And too-thick gloves can be harder to move on and off the bar between brake/shift levers.</p><p>On mountain bikes, they can add diameter to your grip, which can wear out your forearms a little faster. Unfortunately, thinner grips aren’t a great answer as freezing temps tend to make them firmer, which can feel uncomfortable on hands that are borderline freezing anyway.</p><p><strong>What are lobster claw gloves?<br></strong>Lobster claws are gloves where your index and middle finger share a ‘mitten,’ as do your ring and pinky finger, while your thumb gets its own slot. It’s a hybrid mitten-glove, essentially, and may keep your digits warmer than a glove since your fingers are together. Some people love them, some people hate them, and they definitely take getting used to if you’re typically a one-finger braker.</p><p><strong>How should a cycling glove fit?</strong><br>Think Goldilocks: Not too big, not too small, <em>just right</em>. A proper glove fit shouldn’t have a lot of bunching in the palm, as that can create a layer of fabric that’ll slip and could cause you to lose your grip on the bars, particularly when rolling over technical terrain. (This is why you try on the glove and actually grip the handlebars before taking the tags off!)</p><p><strong>How do I find the right size?</strong><br>Generally, most brands have size guides on their sites or with the descriptions of the gloves. Most—like this one from Sealskinz—are based on the diameter of your knuckles (of your four fingers, not your thumb), as measured with a soft tape measure.</p><p><strong>Is there a way to wear gloves with a cycling jacket?</strong><br>Jacket cuffs are often designed with gloves in mind these days, which is why cycling jackets sometimes look as though they have a double cuff. This is so one cuff can go over and one cuff can go under your gloves. Most people aren’t that particular when they put gloves on (don’t sweat it if you don’t do this), but creating some overlap is ideal, regardless of whether you tuck over or under.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof blackline winter mtb gloves\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nukeproof-blackline-winter-gloves-mtb-cold-weather-rides-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>Do I need MTB-specific winter gloves?<br></strong>They can certainly help. Because they’re designed for more rigorous gripping, they tend to have a more padded palm (like a mountain bike glove for other seasons). They also may have a bit more grip, and may have better finger articulation since you’re typically feathering brakes and using thumb levers more on the MTB versus the road.</p><p><strong>Should I use chemical handwarmers inside gloves?<br></strong>If you do, make sure you’re wearing a liner layer between the handwarmer and your skin, otherwise you risk burning yourself! And put it on TOP of your hand, not under your palm.</p><p><strong>What about layering gloves?</strong><br>A thin under-glove layer can make a big difference in how well a glove works—just make sure you still have plenty of room to move your fingers! A set of gloves like the ones from Dissent listed above are great because they’re designed to be layered, so they fit together well. And if you do opt for an extra liner, make sure it’s merino wool or polyester, not cotton.</p><p><strong>Any tips for emergency glove situations?</strong><br>We’ve heard it from pros and amateurs alike, and we follow this rule as well: If you’re not sure what the weather will look like, it’s a great idea to keep a set of plastic surgical gloves and a disposable plastic shower cap crammed in your saddlebag. The gloves on their own will block a bit of wind in a pinch, or can go over or under other gloves to provide added protection.</p><p>The shower cap can snap over your helmet to block vents and serve as a ‘hat.’ Some plastic grocery bags to pull over your socks will block the cold wind from your toes, too!</p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d060069f3f95ade541a89a95d910cd2c5a25da2319af282ec8028667d650d1ad","category":"Cycling"}
