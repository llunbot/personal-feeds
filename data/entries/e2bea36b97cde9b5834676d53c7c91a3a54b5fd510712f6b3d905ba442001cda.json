I focused on those who were there to\ncreate content about the devices, not the devices themselves. It\nwas fun to just float among the crowds with my Nikon Zf and a\n40mm lens.</p>\n\n<p>It was a wonderful spectacle — just to bask in this new kind of\nraw media energy. Content for the sake of content. Events for the\nsake of content. Fog of content. It’s the new way of the world. As\na student of media, I love this chaos and change — because from\nchaos and change comes the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m linking to this photo essay despite, not because of, the fact that it includes a portrait of yours truly dicking around on his phone in the small room where the media wait for post-event briefings. Steve Jobs Theater is a beautiful and unique space, but there are aspects of the space that are hard to capture in photos. Om’s collection here captures the <em>feel</em> of it.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to return the favor by <a href=\"https://glass.photo/gruber/2QUtgADavw0AcPC1CvFkBO\">photographing</a> the <a href=\"https://glass.photo/gruber/31GQdtrAZIqBQs0YaLm4oa\">photographer</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://om.co/2024/09/10/my-thoughts-about-apples-iphone-16-glowtime-event/\">Om’s thoughts on the event and announcements</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/30/om-malik-apple-event\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e2bea36b97cde9b5834676d53c7c91a3a54b5fd510712f6b3d905ba442001cda","category":"Tech"}
