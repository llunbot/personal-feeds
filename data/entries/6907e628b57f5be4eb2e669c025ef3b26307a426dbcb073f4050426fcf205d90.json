Tech prices are going up, but that doesn’t mean you can’t upgrade. This 2020 <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-macbook-pro-i5-2ghz-2020-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-space-gray-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12396&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-pro-2020-13-i5-2ghz-touchbar-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-space-gray-refurbished-2026-02-18&amp;utm_term=SALE-327922\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Pro</a> is in near-mint condition, but it’s still only $429.97 (reg. $1,999) right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 quad-core processor that runs at 2.0GHz, so everyday work like browsing, video calls, and document editing feels smooth. It has 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which is plenty of space for apps, photos, and big project files, and it helps the system stay responsive when you have a lot open at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 13.3-inch Retina display runs at 2560×1600 resolution with True Tone, so text looks sharp, and colors are vivid while the screen adjusts to the lighting in your room. Intel Iris Plus graphics handle streaming, light creative work, and general use without drama. The backlit Magic Keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the Touch Bar and Touch ID give you quick shortcuts and fingerprint login.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get four Thunderbolt 3 ports that handle charging, external displays, and fast storage through USB-C. Wireless connections use 802.11ac Wi Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 for modern routers and accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Grade A refurbished unit should arrive in near-mint condition, with only minor signs of use. It weighs about 3.1 pounds, comes with a charger, and includes a limited third-party warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-macbook-pro-i5-2ghz-2020-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-space-gray-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12396&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-pro-2020-13-i5-2ghz-touchbar-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-space-gray-refurbished-2026-02-18&amp;utm_term=SALE-327922\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Pro</a> while they’re on sale for $430.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sale ends February 22 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/bcc6e4096382c43d542fb29b7b3becf7c40d3c28/store/d858bd71492cd52ff6b435e4d786c0f5bb1d2139c874c4e89882fe2d2654/product_345582_product_shots1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Macbook Pro (2020) 13″ i5 2GHz Touchbar 16GB RAM 1TB SSD Space Gray (Refurbished)<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-macbook-pro-i5-2ghz-2020-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-space-gray-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12396&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-pro-2020-13-i5-2ghz-touchbar-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-space-gray-refurbished&amp;utm_term=SALE-327922\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6907e628b57f5be4eb2e669c025ef3b26307a426dbcb073f4050426fcf205d90","category":"Apple"}
