While chunky grips do have the potential to reduce arm pump for riders with large hands, others with smaller hands may not benefit so much; I personally don’t get on with a large diameter grip, feeling rather like I’m holding onto a pair of toilet rolls. I have fairly small hands, though (span of 18cm).&nbsp;</p><p>Like all ESI Grips, the new Ribbed Chunky, Ribbed Extra Chunky, and Fatty’s are made from latex-free, rubber-free silicone. Unlike the vast majority of mountain bike grips on the market, and those that’ll come stock on complete bikes, ESI Grips are of a slide-on design, lacking the plastic sleeve you’ll see on lock-on models. This is the primary reason why ESI Grips, and other slide-on silicone grips such as those from Wolf Tooth Components, have better vibration damping qualities than standard grips.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8BZmeUV0II?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>The news ESI Grips retail at <span>$</span>19.99 USD for the Ribbed Chunky, $23.99 USD for the Ribbed Extra Chunky, and $24.99 USD for the Fatty’s.
