It’s a great option for gravel racing, as well as bikepacking and more general off-road exploits.</p>\n<p>Firstly, titanium doesn’t corrode, which is a plus over most steel gravel bikes, where exposed metal can rust. This enables brands to offer unpainted, brushed-finished titanium gravel frames. Titanium offers similar ride qualities to steel, but is lighter and stronger.</p>\n<p>Aluminium has half the strength of titanium and has lower fatigue resistance, so aluminium gravel bikes can be more prone to stress fractures. Small dings in aluminium can spread over time and form major cracks, wiping out the frame while titanium is more resistant to impacts.</p>\n<p>Carbon gravel bikes can have similar issues to aluminium concerning robustness if the frame takes a hit, because this can damage and crack the carbon fibre structure.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage of titanium is it’s more expensive than other metals. It’s also harder to work with, which adds to the cost of titanium gravel bikes. You can read more on the pros and cons of titanium in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">bike frame materials</a>.</p>\n<p>Read on for our pick of the best titanium gravel bikes, which make up just a small percentage of the titanium gravel bikes our team of expert testers have reviewed here at <em>BikeRadar </em>over the years.

It’s common for titanium gravel bikes to be left unpainted, although there’s no reason why they can’t be painted and some brands will offer this. No paint means there are no chips to repair; the common brushed or peened finishes for titanium gravel bikes don’t tend to show scratches.</p>\n<p>Titanium is half the weight of steel for a tube of the same tensile strength. It’s also more resistant to impacts and fatigue than aluminium. Since it’s light, the titanium tubing used for bikes is thicker than steel tubing too, which increases its impact resistance.</p>\n<p>Titanium can be left unpainted because the metal is highly corrosion resistant, making it a good option for the poor weather and conditions that are often experienced when gravel riding.</p>\n<p>Titanium gravel bikes, when well designed, have a similar forgiving ride quality to steel gravel bikes, with the metal’s inherent ability to soak up vibrations and surface imperfections an advantage when riding gravel.</p>\n<h3>Titanium gravel bike features</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Enigma Escape gravel bike\" title=\"Enigma Escape titanium-3\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Titanium gravel bikes, such as the Enigma Escape, often come with carbon forks and luggage mounts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Titanium is more difficult to weld than steel or aluminium. Titanium welders tend to be the most highly skilled, so you can expect the welds to be really well finished, with the mark of a good titanium frame being small, regular ‘fishtails’ at the joints.</p>\n<p>Titanium tubing is usually round, at least for the bike’s main triangle, because it’s more complex to form titanium tubing than aluminium or steel. Many titanium gravel bikes offer internal cable and brake hose routing, at least through the down tube. External routing does have advantages for serviceability though.</p>\n<p>It’s usual for a titanium gravel bike to be fitted with a carbon fibre fork, for carbon’s better ability to absorb vibrations and provide a more comfortable ride.</p>\n<p>As with other gravel bikes, you can expect the full set of bottle cage and luggage mounts on a titanium gravel bike, so it can be loaded up for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a>, touring or as one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/whats-the-best-bike-for-commuting/\">best commuter bikes</a>.</p>\n<h3>How much do titanium gravel bikes cost?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Head tube\" title=\"Moots Routt 45-10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Moots gravel bikes are some of the most expensive – but also the most desired.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The major disadvantage of many titanium gravel bikes is their high price compared to other metals. This isn’t always the case though, as some of the examples above demonstrate, but if you’re looking for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-gravel-bike/\">best budget gravel bikes</a>, titanium is unlikely to feature.</p>\n<p>Typically, titanium frameset prices are comparable to carbon fibre and will exceed those of the lowest-priced carbon fibre gravel bikes. That in turn means titanium gravel bikes are often offered with high component specs, including the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">best gravel bike wheels</a> and best gravel groupsets, which in turn raises the price again.</p>\n<p>It’s also often possible to buy titanium gravel bikes as a frameset only, enabling you to build your dream spec, or alternatively to select cheaper gravel components and bring the price of the whole bike down a little.</p>\n<h3>How do titanium gravel bikes compare to carbon gravel bikes?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Grit is a delightful titanium gravel bike.\" title=\"20200214_SB_5DSR_MG_0735\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Titanium gravel bikes are a little heavier than carbon bikes, but less so than aluminium or steel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Titanium gravel bikes tend to be comparable in price to the best carbon gravel bikes, because the raw material is expensive and there’s a similar level of detail that needs to go into making them.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, there’s usually less intricate shaping of titanium framesets, to take advantage of the metal’s inherent strength. Carbon fibre can be moulded into intricate shapes to take advantage of the material’s anisotropy, the technical term for its different properties in different directions.</p>\n<p>Weight-wise, many titanium gravel bikes are a little heavier than many carbon gravel bikes, although less so than aluminium or steel.</p>\n<p>Many of the best bikes for gravel race bikes are made from carbon fibre. However, a titanium gravel bike is more likely to be able to withstand a hard impact than a carbon gravel bike, so its longevity may be greater.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"69c210d617c6b93117c40d7e4f2e659ffd6291df198cfb0b7e9e8c295891643b","category":"Cycling"}
