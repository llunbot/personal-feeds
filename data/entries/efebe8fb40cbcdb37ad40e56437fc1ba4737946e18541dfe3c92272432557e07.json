The move is also apparently visible in Samsung's own supply chain in Korea. Samsung already supplies Apple with OLED panels for the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, which features a tandem design for improved brightness and power efficiency. The report adds that Apple will bring an OLED panel to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> alongside the ‌iPad mini‌ in 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's plans to move the ‌iPad mini‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ to OLED displays is now widely rumored. Research firm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-oled-roadmap/\">Omdia</a> believes that the ‌iPad Air‌ will gain an OLED display in 2026, with the ‌iPad mini‌ following in 2027, but Korea's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices/\"><em>ET News</em></a> agrees with <em>ZDNET</em> that both models will be refreshed with OLED simultaneously in 2026, and there is a chance that Apple will delay bringing OLED to the 13-inch ‌iPad Air‌ until 2027. While the OLED ‌‌iPad Air‌‌ will retain an 11-inch display, the ‌‌iPad mini‌‌'s screen may grow from 8.3- to 8.7-inches in size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnlike Apple's latest ‌iPad Pro‌ models, which feature two-stack low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED panels‌, the ‌iPad mini‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ may have single-stack low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panels, meaning that they may be dimmer and continue to lack ProMotion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/apple-developing-oled-ipad-mini-for-2026/\">Apple Reportedly Developing OLED iPad Mini for 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-developing-oled-ipad-mini-for-2026.2427274/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"efebe8fb40cbcdb37ad40e56437fc1ba4737946e18541dfe3c92272432557e07","category":"Apple"}
