As such, he believes that the machine will not be in the first wave of ‌M3‌ Macs to be released in October. It is not expected emerge until late next year at the earliest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLikewise, new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will not be among the first ‌M3‌ Macs later this year. These machines are expected to feature the ‌M3‌ Pro and ‌M3‌ Max chips and will \"probably\" launch by the middle of 2024 at the latest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe noted that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> ‌Mac mini‌ launched more than two years after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> version was introduced, suggesting that Apple does not see the ‌Mac mini‌ as a device that requires annual refreshes. This is contrasted by the high-end MacBook Pro, a far more popular device, with a refresh cycle of around very four or five quarters.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/\">Gurman: Refreshed High-End MacBook Pro and Mac Mini With M3 Chips to Launch Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-refreshed-high-end-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-chips-to-launch-next-year.2396657/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fc1da9bfcbaf831d5312ce198a00242f5dd8a21d20e97bd4aa35b84b12dba03","category":"Apple"}
