GIS already laminates <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> displays for Apple and boasts a high yield rate. Until now, Foxconn was thought to have been excluded from the headset's supply chain, with China's Luxshare serving as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/apple-reportedly-axes-headset-exclusive-partner/\">sole assembler</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGIS is believed to be operating a dedicated production line for the headset's lens lamination at a plant in Chengdu, China. In line with other reports, the supplier's production line mobilization schedule indicates that Apple's mixed-reality headset will be unveiled at WWDC in June as expected, before launching sometime in the following months. GIS has publicly said that it will begin shipping metaverse-adjacent devices to customers in the second quarter of 2023, which runs from April to June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGIS's involvement apparently lays the groundwork for Foxconn to participate more widely in the second-generation Apple headset's supply chain. In February, it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/23/cheaper-apple-headset-foxconn-report/\">reported</a> that Foxconn is hoping to supply the cheaper model in Apple's second-generation headset lineup.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/udn-com/\">Economic Daily News</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/apple-headset-now-in-final-sprint/\">Apple's Mixed-Reality Headset Now Said to Be in 'Final Sprint' and 'Delivery Stage' Ahead of WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-mixed-reality-headset-now-said-to-be-in-final-sprint-and-delivery-stage-ahead-of-wwdc.2387866/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b46f4b95c79f393524edf2068adcef15f5ccd9c04f694433c4d4d8254e4e5c1c","category":"Apple"}
