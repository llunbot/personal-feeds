He said about 17 percent of\nengagement on Twitter, historically, was through third-party apps,\nwhich played a vital role in defining Twitter’s identity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To my knowledge no one at (or formerly at) Twitter has ever revealed that before. Obviously the overwhelming number of Twitter <em>users</em> only ever used Twitter’s own first-party clients. The reason third-party clients were so important to Twitter, though, is that Twitter <em>power users</em> were drawn to them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jardine said he has received positive feedback on the initial\nlaunch of Ivory, which he admits was released without all the\nfeatures he wanted to include. Users being excited about his work\nis uplifting, he said. But that’s not what entirely motivates him.\n“Without [Ivory], we have no business,” Jardine said. “There’s a\nlot of pressure riding on it.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite the pressure, Haddad seems to be thriving in this brave\nnew world. “I’m not at the whims of a dictator anymore,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amen to that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/26/texas-monthly-tapbots\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fa611ef0279bc92f8e033344c3814ff6243517ae5c962d6bea1fbf36898f1636","category":"Tech"}
