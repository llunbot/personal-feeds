Multiple factors are at play, so many might turn to various <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/blog/what-smart-stats-indicate-hard-drive-failures/\">SMART (self-monitoring, analysis, and reporting technology) data</a>. When it comes to how long the drive has been active, there are backup companies like <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q1-2023/\">Backblaze</a> using hard drives that are nearly 8 years old. That may be why some customers have been panicked, confused, and/or angered to see their Western Digital NAS hard drive automatically given a warning label in Synology's DiskStation Manager (DSM) after they were powered on for three years. With no other factors considered for these automatic flags, Western Digital is accused of age-shaming drives to push people to buy new HDDs prematurely.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The practice's revelation is the last straw for some users. Western Digital already had a steep climb to win back NAS customers' trust after shipping <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/06/lawsuit-vs-western-digital-wants-to-end-any-use-of-smr-in-nas-drives/\">NAS drives with SMR</a> (shingled magnetic recording) instead of CMR (conventional magnetic recording). Now, some are saying they won't use or recommend the company's hard drives anymore.</p>\n<h2>“Warning,” your NAS drive’s been on for 3 years</h2>\n<p>As users have reported online, including on <a href=\"https://www.synoforum.com/threads/western-digital-device-analytics-power-on-hours-warnings-on-wd-reds-after-just-three-years-of-nas-use.10734/\">Synology-focused</a> and <a href=\"https://community.synology.com/enu/forum/1/post/160791\">Synology's own</a> <a href=\"https://community.synology.com/enu/forum/1/post/159537\">forums</a>, as well as on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/13v61pz/anybody_experienced_the_warning_from_wd_analytics/\">Reddit</a> and YouTube, Western Digital drives using Western  Digital Device Analytics (<a href=\"https://www.westerndigital.com/solutions/device-analytics\">WDDA</a>) are getting a \"warning\" stamp in Synology DSM once their power-on hours count hits the three-year mark. WDDA is similar to SMART monitoring and rival offerings, like <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/products/nas-drives/ironwolf-hard-drive/health/\">Seagate's IronWolf</a>, and is supposed to provide analytics and actionable items.</p>\n<p>The recommended action says: \"The drive has accumulated a large number of power on hours [throughout] the entire life of the drive. Please consider to replace the drive soon.\" There seem to be no discernible problems with the hard drives otherwise.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947132#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947132&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"99e32034e90141cf87b70efbc2d1a1120d715d545662c35d8fe13d86b812c826","category":"Tech"}
