The improvements have since rolled out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, and Apple is focusing on Italy next.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iPhone-iOS-15-Italy-Closeup-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-italy-testing\">Apple Maps enthusiast Justin O'Beirne</a>, Apple recently started testing its revamped Maps experience across the Italian Peninsula, including San Marino and Vatican City. The updated maps appear to be limited to devices with the iOS 15 developer or public betas installed for now, but at WWDC 2021 last month, Apple announced that its revamped Maps experience <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/redesigned-apple-maps-expanding/\">would be expanded to all users in Italy and Australia later this year</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn early 2020, Apple said it would begin rolling out the revamped Maps experience across Europe in the coming months, so other countries should soon follow. The updated maps provide more comprehensive views of roads, buildings, parks, airports, shopping malls, sports venues like baseball fields and tennis courts, and other details.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/revamped-apple-maps-testing-in-italy/\">Revamped Apple Maps Now Being Tested in Italy</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/revamped-apple-maps-now-being-tested-in-italy.2305994/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HmakCksL6_o:obGdo4R1tcU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HmakCksL6_o:obGdo4R1tcU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HmakCksL6_o\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c84ddf7b9ee83137b3d229487154f7907471340edce7c9e65a5b7c1df7f39259","category":"Apple"}
