Or maybe you just like attractive, high-resolution desktop wallpapers and you want to make a change? It turns out that Microsoft's design team has rendered <a href=\"https://msdesign.blob.core.windows.net/wallpapers/Microsoft_Nostalgic_Windows_Wallpaper_4k.jpg\">an updated 4K version of the default Windows XP wallpaper</a>—you might know it by its name, \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image)\">Bliss</a>.\"</p>\n<p>It's one of several retro-themed wallpapers on <a href=\"https://wallpapers.microsoft.design/\">this Microsoft Design site</a>, including photorealistic renderings of <em>Solitaire</em>, Paint, and (of course) Clippy. The site has been around for a while and hasn't been updated since December 2022, but Windows engineer Jennifer Gentleman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenMsft/status/1666649807803547648?s=20\">tweeted about it yesterday</a>—it's new to me and maybe to you, too. The most recent wallpapers appear to be products of Microsoft's <a href=\"https://medium.com/@MicrosoftDesign/microsoft-design-week-64fdcd611303\">Design Week event</a>.</p>\n<p>Among others, the Microsoft Design site also hosts the default wallpapers that have come with several Surface PCs, quite a few Pride Month-themed wallpaper designs, and several images focused on the company's recent emoji redesigns and the icons for the Microsoft 365 apps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946449#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946449&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cd7a1849d355f4b56b1007431b2438f311196d033e1bf0aa70ff179e6f742ee4","category":"Tech"}
