The building is a decommissioned coal-fired power station, regarded as an iconic landmark owing to its Art Deco fittings and status as one of the world's largest brick constructions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe store is positioned around four original brick piers from the 1930s, with exposed steel supports on the ceiling. The walls feature an overlaid oak framework of shelving and a revamped fixture set, defining a Genius Bar, hardware flex space, Apple Watch Studio, pickup area, and more. With the new design, Apple has increased the amount of circulation space around the edge of the store. New acoustic baffles on the ceiling improve acoustic clarity inside the store. Apple Battersea also uses more biomaterials to reduce reliance on carbon-intensive elements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Battersea-London-opening-day-genius-bar.jpg\" alt width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" />\r<br />\nApple had moved away from physical Genius Bar sections in its stores in recent years, but Apple Battersea has a dedicated Genius Bar in the left rear corner. This is the second fully fledged Genius Bar that Apple has installed in a store since 2015. The reimagined Genius Bar has a counter for stand-up service in addition to a lowered area where customers can be served sitting down. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe store's flexible hardware space is designed to spotlight Apple's latest devices and can be adapted over time. There is also an in-person Apple Watch Studio where customers can mix and match Apple Watch cases and bands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nToday at Apple sessions at the store draw inspiration from the local area, including photo and art tours around the building. In celebration of the opening of Apple Battersea, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> will host live performances outside the store throughout the rest of the week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>MacRumors is out here at the grand opening of Apple Battersea in South West London today! üçéüá¨üáß <a href=\"https://t.co/BCMhaguYCA\">pic.twitter.com/BCMhaguYCA</a></p>‚Äî MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1669366321883037697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 15, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBattersea Power Station is also home to Apple's new UK headquarters, with enough space for approximately 3,000 employees.
