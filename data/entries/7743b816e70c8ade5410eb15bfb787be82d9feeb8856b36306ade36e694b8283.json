{"title":"The Washington Post Has Lost Over 200,000 Subscribers (and Counting) After Trump Bootlicker Jeff Bezos Blocked Endorsement of Kamala Harris","link":"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations","date":1730154073000,"content":"\n<p>David Folkenflik, reporting for NPR:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Washington Post has been rocked by a tidal wave of\ncancellations from digital subscribers and a series of\nresignations from columnists, as the paper grapples with the\nfallout of owner Jeff Bezos’s decision to block an endorsement of\nVice President Kamala Harris for president.</p>\n\n<p>More than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions\nby midday Monday, according to two people at the paper with\nknowledge of internal matters. Not all cancellations take effect\nimmediately. Still, the figure represents about 8% of the paper’s\npaid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes print\nas well. The number of cancellations continued to grow Monday\nafternoon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those former subscribers who, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/10/washington-post-cancellation.png\">like me</a>, were subscribed through the App Store should already be included in that number. Apple sends developers a server notification upon cancellation, and developers can query the status of the auto-renew toggle at any time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It’s a colossal number,” former Post Executive Editor Marcus\nBrauchli told NPR. “The problem is, people don’t know why the\ndecision was made. We basically know the decision was made but we\ndon’t know what led to it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I misread this statement at first, thinking that Brauchli was saying that we don’t know why so many Post subscribers were cancelling their subscriptions. But I realized after a second read that he’s saying we don’t know why owner Jeff Bezos and publisher/CEO Will Lewis blocked the endorsement, less than two weeks out from Election Day. But we sort of do know. It’s because they’re worried Trump will win and punish, in whatever ways he can, Amazon (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/aws-selected-for-u-s-department-of-defense-joint-warfighting-cloud-capability-contract/\">which has government contracts for AWS cloud services</a>), Blue Origin (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider/\">which has contracts with NASA</a>), and Bezos personally. There’s no other explanation for this decision coming when it did, on the cusp of the election.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chief Executive and Publisher Will Lewis <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris\">explained the\ndecision</a> not to endorse in this year’s presidential race\nor in future elections as a return to the Post’s roots: It has for\nyears styled itself an “independent paper.” Few people inside the\npaper credit that rationale given the timing, however, just days\nbefore a neck-and-neck race between Harris and former President\nDonald Trump.</p>\n\n<p>Former Executive Editor Marty Baron <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5166796/washington-post-decides-not-to-endorse-a-presidential-candidate\">voiced that\nskepticism</a> in an interview with NPR’s Morning Edition\non Monday.</p>\n\n<p>“If this decision had been made three years ago, two years ago,\nmaybe even a year ago, that would’ve been fine,” Baron said. “It’s\na certainly reasonable decision. But this was made within a couple\nof weeks of the election, and there was no substantive serious\ndeliberation with the editorial board of the paper. It was clearly\nmade for other reasons, not for reasons of high principle.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It just doesn’t hold water to make a policy change like this 12 fucking days before any election, let alone <em>this</em> election. Part of what is so damaging about this to the entirety of the Post’s institutional credibility — not just its editorial page — is that Lewis’s announcement of the no-endorsement is so laughably false. Lying hurts any person or institution’s credibility. But it’s absolute poison to a news organization. And the publisher/CEO of the Post tried to sell an obvious post hoc justification. It sounds ridiculous but Bezos and Lewis would have been better off just flat out admitting they were blocking the endorsement because they fear backlash from Trump if he wins. At least that would ring true. If you’re going to serve us a pile of dog shit on a plate, tell us it’s a turd. Don’t try to tell us it’s a sandwich.</p>\n\n<p>Credibility is the only true asset a news publication has.</p>\n\n<p><small>* OK, there’s one other plausible explanation, which is that Jeff Bezos <em>wants</em> to see Trump win. I don’t buy that. Not because I know Bezos’s politics (although Bezos’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/17/806720144/jeff-bezos-pledges-10-billion-to-fight-climate-change-planets-biggest-threat\">statements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bezosearthfund.org/\">charitable contributions</a> on climate change certainly don’t suggest support for Donald “It’s a Hoax” Trump, a man so profoundly ignorant that he’s repeatedly espoused the belief that even if sea levels are rising, it’d be good for the world, because the result, somehow, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-more-oceanfront-property/\">will be more oceanfront real estate</a>). I just don’t think Bezos would block a Post endorsement of Harris even if he personally were voting and rooting for Trump. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/media/jeff-bezos-donald-graham/index.html\">Nothing about his stewardship of the Post since purchasing it for $250 million in 2013</a> suggests he’d do so. He didn’t block the Post from endorsing Hillary Clinton in 2016, nor Joe Biden in 2020. What’s different in 2024 isn’t that Harris offers a different vision than Clinton or Biden, but that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/09/30/trump-doj-revenge-political-enemies-00178218\">Trump has laid clear his agenda of vengeance and retribution</a> against his domestic political enemies, real and imagined, if he returns to the White House.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/28/washington-post-lost-subscribers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7743b816e70c8ade5410eb15bfb787be82d9feeb8856b36306ade36e694b8283","category":"Tech"}
