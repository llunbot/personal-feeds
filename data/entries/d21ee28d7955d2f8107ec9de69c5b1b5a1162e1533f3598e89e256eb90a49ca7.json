And according to the newest leak, it appears that Apple is also giving its magnetic charging system a boost as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As spotted by <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-magsafe-qi-2-2-wireless-charging-ncc-certification/\">91mobiles</a>, Apple has registered MagSafe chargers with model numbers A3503 (2m) and A3502 (1m) supporting Qi 2.2 with the NCC, the Taiwanese regulatory body that verifies devices for telecom and broadcasting technology products. Apple’s current 25W chargers have model numbers A2580 or A3250.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note, the inscriptions on the charging puck suggest the iPhone 17 will support 50W charging, one of the main benefits of Qi 2.2. Qi 2, which was developed using the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\">MagSafe standard</a>, tops out at 15W charging, though MagSafe on the iPhone 16 can reach speeds of 25W with one of the newest chargers. Also new to the standard is better magnetic alignment and tighter compatibility with third-party accessories, <a href=\"https://www.anker.com/blogs/chargers/qi-2-2-wireless-charging\">according to the Wireless Power Consortium</a>. The updated standard is expected to be released later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 in September.
