The screen is again held on with Google's unique combination of glue and rectangular clips. While that combo seems like it would result in better screen adhesion than most smartphones, the methodology actually didn't fare well on the Pixel 5, as users complained about <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/google-says-the-pixel-5s-uneven-panel-gaps-are-nothing-to-worry-about/\">uneven panel gaps</a>. The Pixel 5a display tabs are now a lot bigger, and there are more of them, so hopefully, that will prevent similar alignment problems.</p>\n<p>For a phone with a plastic exterior, there's a surprising amount of metal in the Pixel 5a. One of the first things you'll see after prying off the screen is a metal cover over the motherboard. Like the Pixel 5a, the whole back of the phone is metal, but that metal is hidden in a plastic coating Google calls a \"bio-resin.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790215#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790215&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e84e79fd25247d79fb2d01cfaf15f955ad3e86bde2bc71dbc40b42d3224f5a3","category":"Tech"}
