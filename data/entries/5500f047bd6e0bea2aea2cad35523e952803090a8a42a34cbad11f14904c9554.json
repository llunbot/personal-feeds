{"title":"Everything Continues to Be Going Just Great at Twitter","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/03/tweetdeck-suffers-as-musk-enforces-read-limits-on-twitter/","date":1688403736000,"content":"\n<p>Ivan Mehta, reporting for Twitter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Over the weekend, Elon Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/01/twitter-imposes-limits-on-the-number-of-tweets-users-can-read-amid-extended-outage/\">limited the number of tweets</a> users\ncan read in a day, which he said was to prevent data scraping.\nWhile this measure has affected all Twitter users, TweetDeck users\nin particular are today reporting major problems, including\nnotifications and entire columns failing to load.</p>\n\n<p>Musk initially enforced read-limits of 6,000 daily posts for\nverified users and 600 daily posts for unverified users. Hours\nlater, he increased these limits to 10,000 tweets and 1,000\ntweets, respectively. Given that TweetDeck loads up multiple\ntweets through various columns simultaneously, it’s likely that\nthe effects of the read restrictions are amplified within\nTweetDeck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Needless to say it’s rather nutty that a business whose primary revenue stream is advertising would institute rate limits at all, let alone severe limits that typical users bump up against <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@julipuli/110650981176518772\">in about 20 minutes of browsing</a>. Musk’s thinking, one presumes, is that <em>this</em> is the masterstroke that will prompt people to sign up for Twitter Blue at $8-11/month.</p>\n\n<p>The bigger, more fundamental change Musk instituted over the weekend is making it such that tweets aren’t visible unless you’re logged in to a Twitter account. This broke all sorts of things. Messaging apps (like Apple’s Messages) can no longer render preview cards for tweets, for one thing. More amusingly, <a href=\"https://sfba.social/@sysop408/110639474671754723\">as documented by Sheldon Chang</a>, this change completely broke Twitter itself — some part of the Rube Goldberg-ian machine that assembles users’ timeline feeds was itself subjected to these rate limits, so Twitter wound up DDOSing itself. It’s like a gasoline company instituting rations that stranded its own fleet of tanker trucks.</p>\n\n<p>From its <a href=\"https://medium.com/social-media-help/first-tweet-f2f0530cfa2d\">inception</a> through this weekend, Twitter has been like blogging, insofar as tweets being public. You visit the URL for a tweet, you see the tweet. Now it’s a walled garden, like most of Facebook, available only to logged-in users. I suspect this change will prevent the Internet Archive from caching tweets, too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/everything-continues-to-be-going-just-great-at-twitter\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5500f047bd6e0bea2aea2cad35523e952803090a8a42a34cbad11f14904c9554","category":"Tech"}
