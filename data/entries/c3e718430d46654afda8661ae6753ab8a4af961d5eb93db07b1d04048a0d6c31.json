These are now rolling out of factories—you can expect to read about the new Silverado EV tomorrow and the (allegedly affordable) Equinox EV next week, to name but two. We got <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/the-2024-chevrolet-blazer-first-drive-gms-ev-platform-goes-mainstream/\">a first-blush drive of the Blazer this past winter</a> before GM had to put a stop on sales due to some… <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/reviews/701169/2024-blazer-ev-stranded-broken/\">glitches</a>. Now, with the vehicle back on sale and the software debugged, it's time to see if the fixes helped.</p>\n<p>In reintroducing the Blazer EV and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/gm-starts-selling-chevy-blazer-evs-again-cuts-prices-up-to-6250/\">returning it to market</a>, Chevy has also lowered the price pretty significantly, by an average of about $6,000 per model. The LT AWD now starts at $48,800, and there's a $7,500 incentive for customers who aren't eligible for the IRS clean vehicle tax credit. The RS AWD, which we tested, has an MSRP of $53,200, but with the delivery charge and GM's cash on the hood, it came in at $47,095. Both have an 85 kWh battery good for 279 miles (449 km) max range per charge. The longer-range, bigger-battery 102 kWh RS RWD boasts a more impressive 324 miles ( 521 km) per charge and works out to $48,670.</p>\n<p>These are pretty competitive prices when you consider the mid-sized EV SUV segment. An obvious comparison: The Ioniq 5 SE AWD costs $49,350 and cannot qualify for the federal tax credit (unless leased), and its range runs shy of the Chevy Blazer RS AWD, too, at 260 miles (418 km) versus the Chevy's 279.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026183#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026183&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c3e718430d46654afda8661ae6753ab8a4af961d5eb93db07b1d04048a0d6c31","category":"Tech"}
