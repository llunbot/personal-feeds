He became only the second man in history to win in four consecutive years, the only other being Fausto Coppi between 1946 and 1949.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slovenian attacked on the Colma di Sormano climb and no one could follow. After crossing the finish line, he had plenty of time ‚Äì over three minutes ‚Äì to climb off his bike and raise it over his head in celebration before the arrival of second place <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a>. Further back still, Giulio Ciccone jumped away from his group to claim the final podium spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This win marks Pogaƒçar‚Äôs 25th of the season, but his domination wasn‚Äôt the only talking point surrounding the race. Before the race, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a> revealed he had been ‚Äòdeselected‚Äô while on the team bus to Lombardy despite his second place behind Pogaƒçar at Giro dell‚ÄôEmilia the week prior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teammate Geraint Thomas later said on his podcast, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs not happy. The team‚Äôs not happy. How has it got to this point? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ People who are around Tom I don‚Äôt think help.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours have been swirling that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\" target=\"_blank\">Pidcock could be departing</a> Ineos Grenadiers this offseason. The team‚Äôs best-placed rider at Il Lombardia was Thymen Arensman in 15th.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-how-to-fix-ineos-grenadiers\">Opinion: How do you solve a problem like Ineos?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-il-lombardia-monument\">Opinion: Il Lombardia shouldn‚Äôt be a Monument in its current form</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/il-lombardia-history\">Pro race history: The legend of the first Il Lombardia in 1905</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/zoe-backstedt-cyclist\">‚ÄòThere was never pressure to be in cycling, it was just what I wanted to do‚Äô: Zoe B√§ckstedt interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Zoe B√§ckstedt impresses at Simac Ladies Tour</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"621\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2177439320-970x621.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2177439320-970x621.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2177439320-300x192.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2177439320-768x492.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2177439320-750x480.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2177439320.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zoe B√§ckstedt was a fighting force at the six-day Simac Ladies Tour.
