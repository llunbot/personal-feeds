While the rack looks a bit similar to the existing Piston lineup, the Ion ditches the actual Pistons in favor of ratcheting tire arms similar to many tray style racks like those from 1up USA. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly for e-bike users, the weight limit of the rack is substantially increased, with a full 100lb per tray rating for normal driving. When used on an RV, that weight limit drops to 80lbs per tray, which is still more than the 67lb per tray maximum for the Piston Pro X in normal driving conditions. The Piston Ion is also rated for off-road use, though the weight limit then drops to 50lbs per tray. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kuat Piston Ion Bike rack flat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-6-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting those heavy bikes on the rack should be a breeze with the included aluminum ramp, which can be placed on the rack after you fold the upright completely down. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kuat Piston Ion Bike rack light\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-3-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Kuat Piston Ion Bike rack adjustment\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kuat-Piston-ION-bike-rack-sea-otter-5-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To open the upright, there is a simple lever that you hold down to lift the arm.
