Since the video was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FVEQJNRmfDQ\">posted on November 1</a>, it's garnered over 600,000 views and has been widely discussed across social media. The eBay listing, which lasted 10 days, had a total of 116 bids and 6 bid retractions. One bid earlier in the week topped $99,000. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> to the Mac, Apple utilizes USB-C ports for charging, data, and more. The company has relentlessly stuck to using its proprietary Lightning connector on the ‌iPhone‌, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/iphone-keeping-lightning-no-usb-c/\">reports suggest</a> that it won't be changing anytime soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone‌ X is a 64GB model, and the winning bidder will be receiving the ‌iPhone‌ X in its original box but without any accessories. As a bonus, the winner will also get a 30-minute phone call with Pillonel should they have any questions about how the world's first USB-C ‌iPhone‌ was born.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/12/iphone-x-with-usb-c-port-sells/\">iPhone X With USB-C Port Sells For $86,001 on eBay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-x-with-usb-c-port-sells-for-86-001-on-ebay.2323045/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bJsK-v1QNW0:gqKieIlu_1U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bJsK-v1QNW0:gqKieIlu_1U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cfdf770ac905a691f0db3377dbd7750aa9701c64c25f1aa42bc9348b22d4b03e","category":"Apple"}
