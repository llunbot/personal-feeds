Essentially a dynamo system that powers an electronic rear derailleur, Q’AUTO allows regular bikes to add automatic shifting without the need for additional batteries. Yesterday, Germany’s ROSE Bikes also launched their new Sneak 3 EQ, which is the first bike that we know of to feature the Q’AUTO system. More bikes are coming, though, so the list is sure to grow. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-faded-blue-e1749147618392.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-faded-blue-e1749147618392.webp\" alt=\"ROSE Bikes Sneak 3 EQ highstep faded blue\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-faded-blue-e1749147618392.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-faded-blue-e1749147618392-297x177.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-faded-blue-e1749147618392-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-faded-blue-e1749147618392-768x457.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / ROSE Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Weighing in at a little over 33 lbs, the Sneak 3 EQ rocks a minimalist design while still offering a great ride without compromise. The bike uses clean lines with a purposeful “urban aesthetic”. It also sports a sturdy rear rack and kickstand, making it a perfect choice for everyday use.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-Lowstep-chalk-e1749147644110.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-Lowstep-chalk-e1749147644110.webp\" alt=\"ROSE Bikes Sneak 3 EQ Lowstep chalk\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-Lowstep-chalk-e1749147644110.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-Lowstep-chalk-e1749147644110-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-Lowstep-chalk-e1749147644110-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-Lowstep-chalk-e1749147644110-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-chauk-rear-e1749147663746.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-chauk-rear-e1749147663746.webp\" alt=\"ROSE Bikes Sneak 3 EQ highstep chauk rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-chauk-rear-e1749147663746.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-chauk-rear-e1749147663746-297x176.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-chauk-rear-e1749147663746-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-highstep-chauk-rear-e1749147663746-768x456.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding in bad weather or at night is not an issue with the Sneak 3 EQ’s built-in lighting. Helping get the weight down, and keeping the ride comfortable, a full carbon fork is equipped, along with large tires. Adding to the reliable Shimano drivetrain, ROSE spec’d Shimano brakes as well, making it safer to navigate those mean city streets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Highlight of the Sneak 3 EQ – Shimano’s Q’AUTO</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano’s Q’AUTO shifting is a definite spec highlight of the new Sneak 3 EQ. Q’AUTO works by using “high-precision” sensor tech. It recognizes speed, cadence, and incline in real time and shifts the gears accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-auto-shift-e1749147693847.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-auto-shift-e1749147693847.webp\" alt=\"ROSE Bikes Sneak 3 EQ auto shift\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-auto-shift-e1749147693847.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-auto-shift-e1749147693847-297x183.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-auto-shift-e1749147693847-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-auto-shift-e1749147693847-768x472.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers a smooth auto-shifting experience without the need for a battery. The energy needed to move the rear derailleur is generated while riding, much like a dynamo hub works to power a front light. That means no charging and, better yet, no forgetting to charge, or losing your battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-autoshift-hub-e1749147720236.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-autoshift-hub-e1749147720236.webp\" alt=\"ROSE Bikes Sneak 3 EQ autoshift hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-autoshift-hub-e1749147720236.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-autoshift-hub-e1749147720236-297x128.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-autoshift-hub-e1749147720236-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-autoshift-hub-e1749147720236-768x330.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s said that Q’AUTO not only can adapt to your chosen route, but it can also learn your riding behavior and adjust accordingly. Any manual corrections to the shifter will get saved and used for future shifts. This helps create a smooth and personalised riding experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-QAUTO-cassette-body-e1749147743439.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-QAUTO-cassette-body-e1749147743439.webp\" alt=\"ROSE Bikes Sneak 3 EQ QAUTO cassette body\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-QAUTO-cassette-body-e1749147743439.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-QAUTO-cassette-body-e1749147743439-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-QAUTO-cassette-body-e1749147743439-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-QAUTO-cassette-body-e1749147743439-768x334.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also two modes available with the Q’AUTO system, automatic and manual. This adds to the Sneak 3 EQ flexibility and versatility, allowing the rider to adjust to different ride scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sneak 3 EQ</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sneak 3 EQ is an urban bike that combines the latest shifting tech and innovation with a minimalist approach to design. It offers a high level of functionality and versatility, and is purpose-built for life in the city. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks.webp\" alt=\"ROSE Bikes Sneak 3 EQ cranks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ROSE-Bikes-Sneak-3-EQ-cranks-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sneak 3 EQ will be available from 4 June 2025 at 6 p.m. for €2,399.
