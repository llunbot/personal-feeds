Use their Fit Kits with sister brand Robert Axle Project’s custom thru axles, which have options for any frame, fork, and axle standard out there, and that capacity increases to 70lbs (33kg) by putting the bulk of the load directly on the much larger axle. It’s a solid system we’ve used for loaded touring and bikepacking, and we highly recommend using this system if you’re bringing all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1674\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-4.webp\" alt=\"old man mountain divide xl bike rack shown from top rear angle on a bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-4.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-4-297x249.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-4-1536x1286.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-4-120x100.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-4-768x643.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rack and its mounting arms clear 3″ tires with room to spare, letting you run fenders, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-7.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1124\" height=\"633\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-7.webp\" alt=\"included parts laid out next to old man mountain divide xl bike rack.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-7.webp 1124w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-7-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-7-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-man-mountain-divide-xl-bike-rack-7-768x433.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $288, available now.
