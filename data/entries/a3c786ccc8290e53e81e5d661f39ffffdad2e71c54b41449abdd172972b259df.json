These supernova explosions generate reactions that fuse new atomic nuclei, a process called nucleosynthesis, of heavier elements.</p>\n<p>Using data from COSI, scientists will map where these elements are forming in the Milky Way galaxy. COSI's observations will also yield new insights into the annihilation of positrons, the antimatter equivalent of electrons, which appear to be originating from the center of the galaxy. Another goal for COSI will be to rapidly report the location of short gamma-ray bursts, unimaginably violent explosions that flash and then fade in just a couple of seconds. These bursts are likely caused by merging neutron stars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035108#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035108&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a3c786ccc8290e53e81e5d661f39ffffdad2e71c54b41449abdd172972b259df","category":"Tech"}
