Essentially, the rocket's main engine nozzle sustained temperatures that were higher than anticipated, leading to an explosion of the rocket.</p>\n<p>The accident occurred at 1 minute and 4 seconds into a research flight that launched on September 12, 2022. The emergency escape system performed as intended, rapidly pulling the spacecraft away from the disintegrating rocket. Had a crew been on board this flight, they would have experienced a significant jolt and some high gravitational forces before landing safely in the West Texas desert.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926972#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926972&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d5afd914503de01ee938b9a4e5575c027cecedf17230978707ad7b6537367460","category":"Tech"}
