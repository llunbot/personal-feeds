The ad-free Disney+ plan will be priced at $13.99 per month, while the ad-free Hulu plan will be priced at $17.99 per month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/disney-plus-green.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nRight now, ad-free Disney+ is $10.99 per month, while ad-free Hulu is priced at $14.99 per month. When Disney+ launched three years ago, Disney <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-now-available/\">was charging $6.99</a>, so the price for ad-free access has more than doubled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney is offering an ad-free bundle that includes Hulu and Disney+ for $19.99 per month, which is a $12 discount from the separate pricing. That happens to be the current price of the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle, which will be going up to $24.99 per month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe price of Disney's ad-supported plans will not be changing. Disney+ with ads will continue to be $7.99 per month, which is the same price as the Hulu with ads plan. The ad-supported bundle will be $9.99 per month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to raising the cost of its streaming plans, Disney is also planning to put a stop to password sharing, following in the footsteps of Netflix. Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Disney will \"roll out tactics\" to end password sharing starting in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe pricing increases and the crackdown on password sharing come after a $512 million loss for Disney's streaming division in the third fiscal quarter of 2023, which is better than the $1.1 billion loss from the year-ago quarter. Disney has over 105 million Disney+ subscribers, adding 800,000 subscribers during the quarter.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/\">Hulu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/disney-hulu-price-increase-october/\">Disney+ and Hulu Ad-Free Pricing Going Up in October, Password Sharing Crackdown Coming</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-and-hulu-ad-free-pricing-going-up-in-october-password-sharing-crackdown-coming.2398202/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5885b5b224785a5d330c75d7339ca6290e43340b0bd874f7e257362f203e8123","category":"Apple"}
