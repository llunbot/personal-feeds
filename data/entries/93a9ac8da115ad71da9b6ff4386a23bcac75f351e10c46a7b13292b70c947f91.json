But, things changed in late 2021 with the emergence of omicron, which still reigns supreme today. According to the data, an infection with omicron provided an initial protection of nearly 80 percent between the first three to six months after infection, but that protection rapidly declined. Between nine months and a year, protection fell to around 27.5 percent, then dropped to a negligible 5 percent after a year.</p>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"574\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--1024x574.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--1024x574.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--640x359.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--1536x862.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--2048x1149.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--980x550.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/effectiveness--1440x808.jpg 1440w\" />\n      Effectiveness of previous infection against reinfection.\n        Credit:\n          <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08511-9/figures/1\" target=\"_blank\">Chemaitelly et al., Nature, 2025</a>\n      \n<p>The results of infection-derived protection were similar regardless of whether people were vaccinated or unvaccinated, a sub analysis found.
