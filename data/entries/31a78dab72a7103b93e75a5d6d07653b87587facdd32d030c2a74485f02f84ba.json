One such route is the <a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/routes/35304955\" target=\"_blank\">Monumental Loop</a>, which is based out of the Southern New Mexico city of Las Cruces, co-founded by Matt Mason. The Monumental Loop is a passion project for Matt but this year, he wanted to do something special to celebrate the cycling community in New Mexico. Part of that includes the first-ever New Mexico Bikepacking Summit. The weekend’s events included a Makers’ Mart at <a href=\"https://www.bikelc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Outdoor Adventures</a>, a local bike shop, and a grand depart for the Dangerbird, Matt’s nickname for the Monumental Loop. As you can imagine, after photographing the weekend’s events and touring the northern loop, I’m super zonked, so let’s jump right in!<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/NM-Bikepacking-Summit-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Be it some karmic debt paid or sheer luck, Matt ended up winning the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/10/a-fundraiser-for-ride-group-win-this-baphomet-bicycles-new-mexico-single-speed-rigid-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">Baphomet Bicycles Ride Group raffle bike</a>.
