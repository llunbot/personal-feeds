Here's the simple, straightforward logline HBO provided:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After five years of peace following the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie’s collective past catches up to them, drawing them into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to returning characters, we get some glimpses of some new characters and the actors who will play them. Jeffrey Wright (<em>Westworld</em>, <em>American Fiction</em>) will reprise his role as Isaac from the game, while Kaitlyn Dever (<em>Booksmart</em>, <em>Justified</em>) will play Abby, a key character in the sequel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052716#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052716&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a24bd257db422cd498bf5d0de4a7637576f4ddb7d09986e677b1de3a6e1a6dd7","category":"Tech"}
