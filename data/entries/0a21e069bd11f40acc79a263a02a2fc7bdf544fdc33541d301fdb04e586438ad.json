They may lack some of the mounts for bottles, bags and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-mudguards/\">mudguards</a> usually found on gravel bikes.

Gravel race bikes often don’t take quite such wide tyres as other gravel bikes, however.</p>\n<p>Aerodynamics also come into play, so the best gravel race bikes increasingly offer aero frames.</p>\n<p>Features including extra mounting points are often sacrificed in favour of a faster ride.</p>\n<h3>Gravel race bike geometry</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BMC Kaius ONE 01 gravel bike\" title=\"BMC Kauis 01 One - 15\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The geometry of gravel race bikes is often similar to go-fast road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The frame geometry of a gravel race bike often approaches that of a fast road bike. As with a road race bike, with the rider contributing much of the air resistance, a long and low ride position can add an extra turn of speed.</p>\n<p>The frame angles may be more relaxed than a road race bike though, with the head tube angle and fork trail in particular lowered to add more stability. Although gravel racers are riding fast, they need the ability to tackle obstacles and descend with confidence.</p>\n<p>Look through our reviews above of the best gravel race bikes and you’ll find the compromises from the road-like geometry manifest themselves in repeated reports of bumpy rides and awkward handling on harder terrain. Gravel race bikes often forego comfort and balance in favour of speed.</p>\n<p>If you’re okay with that, fine. But if not, take a look at our wider picks of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a> for something that’s less compromised on technical trails.</p>\n<h3>Gravel race bike components</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Factor Ostro Gravel bike\" title=\"Factor Ostro Gravel - 04\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The handlebar on the Factor Ostro Gravel is said to save 9 watts over a regular handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Gravel race bikes often borrow features from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">best aero road bikes</a>. That includes front-end integration, with many gravel race bikes featuring one-piece aero cockpits.</p>\n<p>These may be faster, but they do remove adjustability, so you need to make sure you’re comfortable with the bar/stem’s reach, width, drop, flare and hand position when buying. A change can be expensive.</p>\n<p>Cables and hoses are increasingly disappearing into the bars, stem and frame as well. With all the major <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">groupset</a> brands now offering wireless links from the shifters to the derailleurs, it’s usually only the brake hoses that need to be routed through the frame.</p>\n<p>Many gravel bike racers opt for clip-on aerobars to add another ride position, that’s lower and gives their hands a rest. These were banned for elite competitors at the 2023 Unbound Gravel, but if you think you might want to use them, make sure you can find a set that will fit to your bars.</p>\n<p>With aero frames come aero wheels, so most gravel race bikes are equipped with aero gravel wheels. If a bike doesn’t come ready-fitted with them, prepare to spend extra on a set of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">best gravel wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">best gravel bike tyres</a> for gravel racing are likely to be lighter in weight, faster-rolling and with less beefy treads. That’s fine if everything is dry and solid, but can catch you out if your race includes prolonged muddier sections or it’s been raining.</p>\n<p>As with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cyclocross-racing/\">cyclocross races</a>, be prepared to swap out your tyres for a set appropriate for the conditions. Consider running a mixed set, which might give you a good balance of grip and speed.</p>\n<h3>Gravel race bike gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Red XPLR 1x crankset on a Canyon Grizl gravel bike\" title=\"SRAM Red XPLR 1x crankset on a Canyon Grizl gravel bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 1x drivetrains are popular on gravel race bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re riding at close to road bike speeds a lot of the time in a gravel race, your gearing needs to offer enough top-end to keep that up at a manageable <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a>.</p>\n<p>Gravel races often include more technical sections and ascents though, so low gears are also important. As with other gravel bikes, gravel race bike gearing may go below 1:1 to help you keep riding.</p>\n<p>This means the best gravel race bikes usually offer a wide spread of gears from a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-setup/\">gravel bike groupset</a> such as Shimano <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-grx-review/\">GRX</a> or SRAM’s X-Range gearing. You may find a compact 50/34t crankset in place of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">super-compact cranksets</a> more usual on all-rounder gravel bikes.</p>\n<p>Don’t assume all gravel races take place over smooth, mud-free surfaces either. Returning to Unbound 2023, a muddy section close to the start led to many riders having to dismount and clear their drivetrains and wheels.</p>\n<p>A 1x setup may offer fewer gears than a double-chainring groupset, but it covers much the same range and should help avoid some of the clogging issues of a 2x groupset, maybe providing a winning advantage.</p>\n<p>Therefore, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x setups</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/gravel-groupset/sram-red-etap-axs-xplr/\">SRAM XPLR</a> are a popular choice on gravel race bikes. They may be more aero too. Some competitors run aero single chainrings for an extra turn of speed.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0a21e069bd11f40acc79a263a02a2fc7bdf544fdc33541d301fdb04e586438ad","category":"Cycling"}
