This amazing\ntechnology deserves a good user experience, and we gave it one.</p>\n\n<p>Partnering with <a href=\"http://www.mastodon.social/@soroush\">@Soroush</a> to make that happen has been a dream,\nand I’m so excited to share Short Circuit with you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Very nicely done AI chat app for iOS. Worth checking out for the splendid icon alone. (Short Circuit works OK on MacOS via Catalyst, but the developers have a proper Mac app in the works.) If you’re new to ChatGPT and aren’t sure what to do, there’s a fun “random prompt” button in the chat input field. The integration with Shortcuts means you can just say “Hey Siri, ask Shorty...” and get answers from ChatGPT instead of Siri itself. It’s free to try for a limited number of answers; after that, reasonably priced subscriptions (ChatGPT is not free):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$3/month: 100 answers</li>\n<li>$6/month: 300 answers</li>\n<li>$15/month: 1,000 answers </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They also offer a $30 lifetime unlock, if you have your own OpenAI developer token.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/17/short-circuit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ba7ed6266d05304914a79bc03e7a599c6f870e5728c22fd72abb0735add80951","category":"Tech"}
