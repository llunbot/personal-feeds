Especially since it’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHYQ1VJ/?th=1\">now available for $329, a savings of $70 off its MSRP</a>, a fantastic price point for the best smartwatch you an buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gorgeous smartwatch has a large, fairly bright display that makes it easy to read any information available on it, from app notifications to texts and map directions. There are tons of health features built into this tiny wearable device, from taking ECGs to sending out alerts for high or low heart rates, tracking sleep habits, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478899/apple-watch-series-10-review.html\">reviewed the Apple Watch Series 10</a> and gave it a near-perfect score, as well as our Editor’s Choice award. We really appreciated the easier-to-read display, how fast it charges, and just how great it looks. While we don’t love the limited battery life, it’s nothing that can’t be fixed with a daily recharge. The double-tap gesture where you control things on your Apple Watch is perhaps one of the coolest features because you don’t even have to physically touch the screen to answer or end calls, control music, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss out on the year’s first <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHYQ1VJ/?th=1\">Apple Watch 10 deal and get one for $329 at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHYQ1VJ/?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2d1b3ff83f2d9b2d71ded480bdad681e5fd72f240c0bde01d32a2beb51911f7b","category":"Apple"}
