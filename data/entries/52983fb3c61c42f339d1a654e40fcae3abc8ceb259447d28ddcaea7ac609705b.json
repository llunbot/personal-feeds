{"title":"Review: GravaStar's Unique Robot-Inspired Power Adapter Fast-Charges iPhone and Offers Two USB-C Ports","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/review/gravastar-delta35-fast-charger/","date":1695762033000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.gravastar.com/\">GravaStar</a> is a small company that designs quirky speakers and unique desktop power adapters, and its latest product, the <a href=\"https://www.gravastar.com/products/delta35\">Delta35 GaN Fast Charger</a>, combines fun and functionality. The Delta35 is a 35-watt power adapter that looks like a little robot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/gravastar-delta-35-main.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" />\r<br />\nThere are two USB-C ports at the top of the power adapter, LED lights that serve as eyes and glow when the adapter is in use, and fold-up prongs for charging at the bottom. GravaStar has also added two ball-jointed ears or antennae, and two ball-jointed arms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the antennae and the arms can be repositioned and moved around, so the little robot charger can serve as a desktop distraction when it's not in use as a charger. The arms, antennae, and other robotic design elements serve no practical purpose, but they add visual interest to the power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe two USB-C ports on the Delta35 are at the top of the power adapter. Given this design, it works well plugged into a desktop power strip because that is the ideal orientation of the charger, but it can also be used in the wall. Note that it will look a little odd plugged into the wall because the robot's features will be sideways.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is a charger that uses Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology as most do these days, so it is compact. It does not take up much room on a desktop and is similar in size to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> charger. While the prongs fold down, the arms and antennae add bulk. Even so, it's still small enough to be tucked into a bag for use as a charger when on the go.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/gravastar-delta-35-charging.jpg\" alt width=\"1982\" height=\"1113\" />\r<br />\nThe Delta35 maxes out at 35W, which is enough to charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, ‌iPad‌, or MacBook, but it isn't enough capacity to charge multiple devices at their maximum speeds at one time. With just the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> plugged in, the Delta35 is sized for fast charging, and it can deliver a ~50 percent charge in 30 minutes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen two devices are plugged in, the power is split between them with each port receiving 12W, so charging speeds slow down. 35W is on the lower side for a two-port charger, but if you're doing something like charging an ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ on your desk throughout the day and don't need power quick, it works out well as a desktop solution.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn my testing, the Delta35 worked as expected, and I appreciated the design, but I do wish it was delivering more power. As it stands, it is appropriate for the ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and other similar smaller devices, but not more powerful Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nI will point out that this is essentially the same as the 35W dual USB-C power adapter that Apple offers alongside the ‌MacBook Air‌ and charges $59 for. GravaStar's version is cuter and costs a lot less at $30.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Delta35 GaN Fast Charger can be <a href=\"https://www.gravastar.com/products/delta35\">ordered from the GravaStar website</a> for $29.95. It comes in white and pink and will be shipped starting on October 20.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/gravastar-delta35-fast-charger/\">Review: GravaStar's Unique Robot-Inspired Power Adapter Fast-Charges iPhone and Offers Two USB-C Ports</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-gravastars-unique-robot-inspired-power-adapter-fast-charges-iphone-and-offers-two-usb-c-ports.2404889/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"52983fb3c61c42f339d1a654e40fcae3abc8ceb259447d28ddcaea7ac609705b","category":"Apple"}
