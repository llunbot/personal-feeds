The capsule crested at an altitude of 107 km.</p>\n<p>This was Blue Origin's second human spaceflight and garnered widespread attention because among the crew was <em>Star Trek</em> actor William Shatner, a guest of Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos. “That’s unlike anything I’ve ever felt before,\" Shatner said upon landing. \"Everybody in the world needs to do this.\"</p>\n<p>Blue Origin will now target one more crew flight in 2021, with six yet-unnamed passengers, likely to take place in December. The cadence for human suborbital missions should ramp up to 6 to 12 passenger flights in 2022. The main impediment to increasing cadence is believed to be heat shield refurbishment—there is plenty of demand from customers, even at prices of $1 million and higher for a seat on early missions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803710#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803710&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3f52c907e20249a6b350fac38bb68e9fbfbf1c8b1ff51c01b6731ef338c766d5","category":"Tech"}
