By bleaching away the pigments in plant cells, Siegfried Fink managed to <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/hfsg.1992.46.5.403/html\" target=\"_blank\">create transparent wood</a>, and he published his technique in a niche wood technology journal. The 1992 paper remained the last word on see-through wood for more than a decade, until a researcher named Lars Berglund stumbled across it.</p>\n<p>Berglund was inspired by Fink’s discovery, but not for botanical reasons. The materials scientist, who works at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, specializes in polymer composites and was interested in creating a more robust alternative to transparent plastic. And he wasn’t the only one interested in wood’s virtues. Across the ocean, researchers at the University of Maryland were busy on a related goal: harnessing the strength of wood for nontraditional purposes.</p>\n<p>Now, after years of experiments, the research of these groups is starting to bear fruit. Transparent wood could soon find uses in super-strong screens for smartphones; in soft, glowing light fixtures; and even as structural features, such as color-changing windows.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989784#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989784&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa8463ce8a52c01fc672184f230eab842bc52c1927872ef254a238678f6e3fa6","category":"Tech"}
