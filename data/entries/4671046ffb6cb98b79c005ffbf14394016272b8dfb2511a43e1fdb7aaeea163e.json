Taking just 12 days, 12 hours, and 21 minutes to travel 2,670 miles, unofficially, Lachlan has ridden the route faster than anyone else in history. Officially though, <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/biking/lachlan-morton-tour-divide-route-record\" target=\"_blank\">the record still belongs to the late Mike Hall</a> since Lachlan’s film crew violated the unsupported nature of the Tour Divide’s legacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless,<a href=\"https://efprocycling.com/culture/the-great-divide-mountain-bike-route/\" target=\"_blank\"> Lachlan claims</a> it was never about the record, instead waiting “to experience the big point-to-point in a mentally and physically sustainable way, at least for him.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to the finish line, Lachlan needed a full complement of specialized gear including prototype bags from Tailfin. That includes a number of spare including spare spokes, which Lachlan ended up using to fix his broken derailleur(fast forward to 19:59). Dig in to find out what was used, what wasn’t, and start planning your next big adventure!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From Tailfin:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dig into the details and the reasons behind the bike and kit setup Lachlan Morton chose for his recent epic Canada to Mexico/Tour Divide FKT ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting a blistering time of 12 days, 12 hours and 21 minutes to get from Banff to Antelope Wells Lachlan proved panniers can be fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His setup also enabled him to pack plenty of storage onto his Cannondale Scalpel hardtail to ensure complete self-sufficiency on some of the more remote sections when he would need to be carrying 30 hours worth of food and water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a member of Tailfin’s R&amp;D Division Lachlan was able to utilize a prototype frame bag and a unique new AeroPack top bag design, providing us with valuable feedback for future product development. He also opted to use a set of standard production 10L Mini Panniers, 1.1L Top Tube Pack (in prototype material), 3L Downtube Pack and a 1.7L Downtube Pack under his aerobars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lachlan’s bike setup</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Frame: Cannondale Scalpel Hi-Mod Ultimate hardtail</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fork: Cannondale Lefty Ocho, 100mm travel </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drivetrain: SRAM XX1 AXS, 38T chainring, 10-52t cassette</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brakes: SRAM Level Ultimate</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wheels: FSA Gradient Off-road i29</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tires: Vittoria Mezcal Graphene 2.0 29×2.35” with Airliner Light XC inserts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handlebar: FSA KFX Carbon flat bar cut 64cm with FSA TT extensions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stem: FSA adjustable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seatpost: FSA Flowtron XC dropper</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saddle: Prologo Scratch M5 Space</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GPS: Wahoo Elemnt Bolt</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tailfin equipment:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Under bar: 1.7L Downtube Pack</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Top tube: 1.1L zipped Top Tube Pack (prototype form)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frame: Prototype full frame bag</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Downtube: 3L Downtube pack</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear: Prototype Carbon AeroPack with 2x production 10L Mini Panniers </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prototype-tailfin-bags-lachlan-morton-tour-divide-bike-check/\">Check Out the Prototype Tailfin Bags Lachlan Morton Used on His Insane Tour Divide Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4671046ffb6cb98b79c005ffbf14394016272b8dfb2511a43e1fdb7aaeea163e","category":"Cycling"}
