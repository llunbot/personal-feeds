The vaccinated\npatient, she said, just needed a little oxygen and is expected to\nfully recover. Some of the others are dying.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very\nserious COVID infections,” wrote Cobia, a hospitalist at Grandview\nMedical Center in Birmingham, in an emotional <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/brytneysnowcobia/posts/10200951240955876\">Facebook post\nSunday</a>. “One of the last things they do before they’re\nintubated is beg me for the vaccine. I hold their hand and tell\nthem that I’m sorry, but it’s too late.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good link to spread. Fox News should put this doctor on the air in prime time.
