Falling in March, it has the alternative names of <em>La Primavera</em> – The Spring Classic – and <em>La Classicissima </em>– essentially meaning the greatest of all <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">the Classics</a>. This year’s edition will be held on Saturday 18th March 2023.</p>\n<p>It’s one of the oldest races on the calendar, having been first held in 1907, and with a total route distance (including neutral zone) of over 300km, it’s also the longest.</p>\n<p>But the real selling point of Milan-San Remo is its sheer unpredictability. The race’s length, combined with some spitefully placed climbs right at the end of the route and the constant risk of inclement weather, opens up the possibilities for a lot of riders.</p>\n<p>Big breakaways, small breakaways, bunch sprints and brave solo attacks can all win on the day, with everyone from the burliest of sprinters to the slightest of climbers in with a chance of riding to glory on the Ligurian coast. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/milan-san-remo-2022-photos\" target=\"_blank\">The 2022 race</a> was won by Matej Mohorič, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dropper-post-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">dropper post</a> and all, whose solo attack held off the bunch for victory.</p>\n<h2>Milan-San Remo 2023: Key information</h2>\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"milan-sanremo-cauld-17\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005710/milan-sanremo-cauld-17.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Milan-San Remo takes riders on a very long tour of Italy’s Ligurian coast</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday 18th March 2023</li>\n<li><strong>Start</strong>: Abbiategrasso, Italy</li>\n<li><strong>Finish</strong>: San Remo, Italy</li>\n<li><strong>Distance</strong>: 294km</li>\n<li><strong>UK live television coverage</strong>: 09:45 – 17:30 GCN+, discovery+, Eurosport 2</li>\n<li><strong>Last winner</strong>: Matej Mohorič (Bahrain Victorious)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Milan-San Remo 2023: Route and profile</h2>\n<div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-map.jpeg\" alt width=\"852\" height=\"965\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-map.jpeg 852w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-map-265x300.jpeg 265w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-map-768x870.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-map-750x849.jpeg 750w\" /></p>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<p>This year’s route will begin in Abbiategrasso, 22km southwest of Milan, and rejoin the usual route at Pavia, 30km into the course.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-970x646.jpeg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"646\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-750x499.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-1140x759.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-profile.jpeg 1280w\" /></p>\n<div> </div>\n<p>Even with the riders good and softened by the preceding 240km, the Tre Capi (Capo Mele, Capo Cervo and Capo Berta) are still barely noticeable bumps in the road. However, their arrival signifies that it’s time for the teams to start pressing on in earnest.</p>\n<p>Already wound up to near warp-speed by this point, the end game really kicks off with the 5.6km long Cipressa. With an average gradient of 4.1%, it comes after 263km and with gradients touching 9%, it’s a bona fide climbing test that has often foiled the plans of sprinters hoping to cling on for a bunch finish.</p>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123102/milan_san_remo_cipressa_profile.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123102/milan_san_remo_cipressa_profile.jpeg 584w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123102/milan_san_remo_cipressa_profile-206x300.jpeg 206w\" alt width=\"584\" height=\"852\" /></div>\n<p>Most of the time it serves mainly as an opportunity to potentially get rid of some of your rivals rather than win the race outright, but it’s not impossible to launch a successful attack here either. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vincenzo-nibali\">Vincenzo Nibali</a> made good ground on the bunch by attacking on the Cipressa in 2014, as did Marco Pantani in 1999.</p>\n<p>Still, to make anything stick has proven notoriously difficult, and the reason for that is the flat section that lies between it and the approaching Poggio.<span> </span></p>\n<p>Usually, the Poggio di San Remo is the day’s decisive climb. If a rider or group is going to make a break from the pack, it’s more than likely to come on the upper slopes of this iconic climb.</p>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123104/milan_san_remo_poggio_profile.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123104/milan_san_remo_poggio_profile.jpeg 531w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123104/milan_san_remo_poggio_profile-187x300.jpeg 187w\" alt width=\"531\" height=\"852\" /></div>\n<p>Coming a mere 9km from the finish, positioning here is vital, something that guarantees the peloton will hit it at almost sprint pace.</p>\n<p>This ascent is only 3.7km and its ramps are not particularly severe, but the speed at which it is taken, added to the fatigue induced from the Cipressa – not to mention the 280km the riders have ridden by this point – is truly phenomenal and means that groups coming over the top are often in a bedraggled state.</p>\n<p>They’re then instantly thrown into a highly technical descent, which has also proven a launchpad for decisive attacks in the past, including Mohorič’s win in 2022. Yet when it levels out again in the middle of San Remo, the roads are straight enough that any escaped rider will find themselves well within sight of the bunch.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-finish.jpeg\" alt width=\"666\" height=\"852\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-finish.jpeg 666w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Milan-San-Remo-2023-finish-235x300.jpeg 235w\" /></p>\n<p>The final bend comes with 750m to go. Swinging right onto the Via Roma finishing straight, it’s rare even for breakaway riders to get time to take their hands off the bars.</p>\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

Speaking of Pidcock, the 23-year-old soloed to a phenomenal victory at Strade Bianche, so keep an eye out for the man from Leeds.</p>\n<h2>Milan-San Remo 2023: start list</h2>\n<p>Line-ups TBC.</p>\n<p>AG2R-Citroën<br />Alpecin-Deceuninck<br />Arkéa-Samsic<br />Astana Qazaqstan<br />Bahrain Victorious<br />Bora-Hansgrohe<br />Cofidis<br />EF Education-EasyPost<br />Eolo-Kometa<br />Green Project-Bardiani-CSF-Faizane’<br />Groupama-FDJ<br />Ineos Grenadiers<br />Intermarché-Circus-Wanty<br />Israel-Premier Tech<br />Jayco-AlUla<br />Jumbo-Visma<br />Lotto-Dstny<br />Movistar<br />Q36.5 Pro Cycling<br />Soudal-QuickStep<br />Team DSM<br />TotalEnergies<br />Trek-Segafredo<br />Tudor Pro Cycling<br />UAE Team Emirates</p>\n<h3>Milan-San Remo previous winners</h3>\n<p>2022 – Matej Mohorič (SVN) Bahrain Victorious<br />2021 – Jasper Stuyven (BEL) Trek-Segafredo<br />2020 – Wout van Aert (BEL) Team Jumbo–Visma<br />2019 – Julian Alaphilippe (FRA) Deceuninck-QuickStep<br />2018 – Vincenzo Nibali (ITA) Bahrain-Merida<br />2017 – Michał Kwiatkowski (POL) Team Sky<br />2016 – Arnaud Demare (FRA) FDJ<br />2015 – John Degenkolb (GER) Giant-Alpecin<br />2014 – Alexander Kristoff (NOR) Katusha<br />2013 – Gerard Ciolek (GER) MTN-Qhubeka<br />2012 – Simon Gerrans (AUS) Orica-GreenEdge<br />2011 – Matthew Goss (AUS) HTC High Road<br />2010 – Oscar Freire (ESP) Rabobank<br />2009 – Mark Cavendish (GBR) Colombia-HTC<br />2008 – Fabian Cancellara (SUI) CSC</p>\n<h2>Milan-San Remo: History</h2>\n<p>With the first edition running in 1907, Milan-San Remo has a history as long as its route, totalling over 300km (including the neutral zone at the start).</p>\n<p>It is therefore probably one of the only professional races that has retained, let alone lengthened, its distance over the years, and the prestige associated with the event has only grown with it.</p>\n<p>Milan-San Remo can actually be traced back to 1906, when a two-day amateur race between Milan and San Remo was held for amateurs, but after little interest was initially shown, the organiser of the Giro di Lombardia, a race which had seen its inauguration the year before, approached the newspaper <em>Gazetta Dello Sport</em> and proposed its taking over of the race.</p>\n<p><em>Gazetta</em> was in fact already chief organiser of the Giro di Lombardia (or Tour of Lombardy), and in 1909 it would also take part in the founding of the Giro d’Italia, cementing its place in what would become Italy’s three biggest races.</p>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123113/80a_8028-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123113/80a_8028-970x647.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123113/80a_8028-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123113/80a_8028-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123113/80a_8028-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123113/80a_8028-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123113/80a_8028.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"647\" /></div>\n<p>Poor road surfaces, temperamental spring weather and primitive bicycles meant that merely completing the distance was a remarkable achievement in the early days, but as the sport progressed, so did the race, and during the 1950s Milan-San Remo began to develop its reputation as a sprinter’s classic.</p>\n<p>The roads, bikes, investment and growing professionalism meant that no longer did pelotons start as one and finish as a bedraggled mess of individuals, with sometimes hours between them.</p>\n<p>The Tour de France was experiencing a similar problem, with more editions – or stages – finishing with large groups of riders arriving at the finish together. Where the Tour organisers introduced the sprinter’s jersey to reestablish some excitement, the organisers of Milan-San Remo also made some changes.</p>\n<p>The route’s only climb had traditionally been the Turchino pass, a longer climb that came at about half distance as an opportunity for the stronger riders to distance themselves.</p>\n<p>But in time they began to come over the Turchino together, and so the Poggio was introduced in 1960. The fact that Tom Simpson won the race in 1965 suggests diversity, but the desired effect was effectively neutralised by the emergence of one Eddy Merckx, who won Milan-San Remo on seven occasions between 1966 and 1976, the first coming when he was just 20 years old.</p>\n<p>That record of most wins has remained to date, as has the perpetuation of Milan-San Remo being classified a sprinter’s race, despite increasingly more climbs being added, such as the Cipressa in 1982 or the Turchino-esque La Manie in 2008.</p>\n<p>Another, Pompeiana, was destined to be included as a vicious penultimate climb in the 2014 edition, but landslides causing roadblocks and then dismissals from certain riders – Mark Cavendish being one of them – claiming the parcours had been updated beyond their capabilities, meant that it never materialised.</p>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"646\" /></div>\n<p>It must therefore not be forgotten that Milan-San Remo has never been a straightforward gallop. Despite common sprinter names such as Merckx, Kelly, Zabel, Friere, or more obviously Cipollini and Cavendish, proliferating on the list of winners, the efforts they will have had to put in in order to get over the preceding climbs – not to mention the distance at such an early stage of the season – is often forgotten.</p>\n<p>The fact that Marcel Kittel never even started it, or that names we don’t associate with sprinting, such as Gerrans, Cancellara, Fignon or Chiappucci, pepper the alumni of winners are only further reminders of its nature. Yes, Milan-San Remo is a ‘sprinter’s classic’, but that certainly doesn’t mean it’s always won by one.</p>\n<h3>Milan-San Remo: The Epics</h3>\n<p>We take a look at some of the most memorable editions, moments and riders that have played a part in the race’s history.</p>\n<h3>1910 – Riders on the storm</h3>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123120/ofs_eugene_christophe_1921_-647x970.jpg\" alt width=\"647\" height=\"970\" /></div>\n<p>The fourth edition of Milan-San Remo after its inauguration in 1907 is generally regarded as having been held in some of the worst weather conditions that bicycle racers have come up against. The eventual winner, Eugene Christophe, is also famous for being the first person to wear the yellow jersey at the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>As the riders lined up on the Milanese start line at 6am, heavy snow was reported to be falling on the Turchino Pass – a stalwart of the parcours, coming as a mid-distance test for the riders – which caused many to abandon before the race had even begun. Once out on the road, the riders were soon isolated and riding by themselves amid the harsh conditions, and by the time they reached the Turchino there were only half of them left.</p>\n<p>Belgian Cyrille Van Hauwaert was first over the top, 10 minutes ahead of the next rider, but took shelter in a roadside cottage and refused to continue. Christophe himself stopped too, but resumed after eating and finding some trousers to wear, and eventually made his way to front of the field.</p>\n<p>When he eventually arrived in San Remo he didn’t even realise he had won after mistakenly thinking he had taken a wrong turn. He was taken to hospital with frostbite, and wasn’t released for a further month.</p>\n<p>Second place Luigi Ganna arrived almost 40 minutes after Christophe, but was disqualified for having taken a lift in a car, and only five riders out of 63 starters made it to the finish. Those, as they say, were the days.</p>\n<h3>2013 – Please take the replacement bus service…</h3>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123126/ofs_milan-sanremo_2013_21-970x644.jpg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"644\" /></div>\n<p>While Eugene Christophe and the like raced in an era when bicycle races were feats of endurance that bordered on the militaristic, today’s racers, while probably carrying similar DNA, are of an era of professionalised, commercialised sport.</p>\n<p>This means that winning a race no longer results in having to spend a month in hospital, but the weather can still have an impact.</p>\n<p>The year that Gerald Ciolek won was a modern-era hark back to the days of raw physical suffering though, with reports of riders crying and shivering uncontrollably as they rode through the sleet and snow.</p>\n<p>So bad were the conditions that the race was shortened from 298km to 246km, and the two highest climbs – the Turchino and La Manie – were bypassed, with the riders climbing into their team buses and driven to the coast in a mid-race transfer.</p>\n<p>Ian Stannard and Sylvain Chavanel led a dwindling bunch over the Poggio (the final climb of the race), and formed a six-man group that also included Fabian Cancellara and Peter Sagan, which Ciolek, in a sprint that was painful just watching, eventually won out of.</p>\n<h3>The nail-biters</h3>\n<h3>1992 – Demon descending</h3>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123133/milan_san_remo_kelly_920321-970x646.jpg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"646\" /></div>\n<p>Being the best part of 300km long, and with a series of testing climbs peppered throughout the parcours, Milan-San Remo is clearly a race that requires a decent amount of physical endeavour.</p>\n<p>But the nature of the course allows for a long list of potential winners, and an annual display of tactical complexity.</p>\n<p>One such example was when Sean Kelly pipped Moreno Argentin in ’92: The Italian was a hot favourite after notching up three consecutive wins in Tirreno-Adriatico, and after powering away on the Poggio he indeed appeared to have an insurmountable gap.</p>\n<p>But Kelly, in the twilight of his career and having struggled on the climb, eschewed expectation and attacked on the descent.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of Argentin’s weak descending skills, the Irishman eventually bridged across and unashamedly refused to work, before putting Argentin to the sword in the sprint.</p>\n<h3>1999 – By a Tchmillimeter</h3>\n<p>The ’99 edition of Milan-San Remo pitted a typically broad array of favourites together, from the pure sprint speed of Erik Zabel and all-round capabilities of Michele Bartoli to the climbing prowess of Marco Pantani.</p>\n<p>The latter two had forged ahead before commencing the Poggio, but a lack of cohesion meant that everything came back together on the run-in, for what was then taken to be a guaranteed Erik Zabel win.</p>\n<p>But with less than a kilometre to go, the Russian/Belgian (and now officially Moldovan) Andrei Tchmil took a flyer. Already a victor at Paris-Roubaix and Paris-Tours, but not necessarily on the radar for Milan-San Remo, Tchmil’s deftly timed attack proved to be the winning move, leaving the galloping bunch, led by Zabel, to fight for second.</p>\n<h3>The to-the-liners</h3>\n<h3>2004 – Zabel surprised</h3>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs.jpg 1852w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"646\" /></div>\n<p>Along with celebrating a lap early, it’s probably one of the most embarrassing and frustrating things that could happen to a professional cyclist.
