Yet that’s how we view the cobbled Classics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pavé of Roubaix and bergs of Flanders are almost comical in their unsuitability for a cycling race, and if they weren’t century-old institutions I doubt anyone would think to create Paris-Roubaix or the Ronde van Vlaanderen today. It would be like suggesting that Formula 1 racetracks needed more potholes, or the World Snooker Championship would be better if the tables were on springs.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2023\">This is your chance to try a Canyon bike before you buy: Cyclist Track Days are back for 2023</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bealach-na-ba\">Classic climb: Bealach na Bà, the climb that goes to 11</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride\">Orientales Express: Pyrenees Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>But it’s the very insanity of the concept of racing on cobbles that makes the events so exciting, so visceral, so unpredictable, so unmissable. Of the five Monuments of cycling – Milan-San Remo, Ronde van Vlaanderen, Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Il Lombardia – it’s the two on cobbles that are head and shoulders above the others (this is where I get angry letters from readers telling me that, actually, Liège is the true aficionado’s race. No it isn’t, it’s too long and seems to take place mostly on nondescript roads and through housing estates).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filth, the brutality, the drama, the crowds and the potential for carnage are what make the cobbled Monuments the highlights of the spring season, and the only question remains: which is best of the two? There have been some especially memorable editions of Roubaix – the one in 2021 won by a mud-caked Sonny Colbrelli is a case in point – but in general I would plump for Flanders as the race that is consistently the most exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On so many occasions the outcome of the Ronde seems to be written, only for the story to change in the closing chapters, culminating in a final twist that no one saw coming. I just love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of which is your favourite, this month’s Big Ride doesn’t discriminate. It starts on the bergs of Flanders, takes in the cobbles of Roubaix and ends at the city’s iconic velodrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the best of all worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pete Muir</strong> Editor</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Patrik Lundin</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 138?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clash of the Titans:</strong> In cycling’s version of King Kong vs Godzilla, the bergs of Flanders come face-to-face with the cobbles of Roubaix in one epic ride</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shark tale:</strong> Vincenzo Nibali’s retirement last autumn meant bidding farewell to one of professional cycling’s most versatile and enterprising racers. The Italian legend goes on a deep dive of his career, the state of the modern sport and what’s next for him</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What we ride:</strong> As cycling journalists, we are privileged to test some of the best (and occasionally dodgiest) bikes on the planet. But what about our own bikes – the ones we ride and cherish the most? In the first of a new series, three <em>Cyclist </em>team members reveal their prized possessions…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mont Cenis:</strong> The Alpine climb that follows in the footsteps of elephants</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cosmic revival:</strong> After a turbulent few years, the iconic French brand Mavic is back and aiming to return to the top</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The harder they come:</strong> On the longest day of the year, Chase the Sun Italia sets out to ride 275km coast-to-coast, traversing the golden valleys of Emilia-Romagna and rolling vineyards of Tuscany before delivering riders to the Tyrrhenian Sea. Is sounds almost romantic. Doesn’t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all this and much more, pick up your copy of <em>Cyclist</em> issue 138, <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-138\" target=\"_blank\">on sale now</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Subscribe to <em>Cyclist</em> and get the best bikes, rides and cycling exclusives</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get three months of <em>Cyclist</em> for just £1.67 an issue (usually £6.45), delivered free of charge to your door before it hits the shops</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://cyclistmag.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to find out more and subscribe to Cyclist Magazine</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-138\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to buy Cyclist issue 138 at the Cyclist Shop </a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 138: on sale now!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"27498e282288671b16f66f5b43f3d479f5fc3871ff8e7cbebfafba18171000d1","category":"Cycling"}
