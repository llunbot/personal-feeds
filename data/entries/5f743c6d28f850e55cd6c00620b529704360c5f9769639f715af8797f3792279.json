That mid-sized power pack delivers a claimed 37% more range than most “lightweight” e-mountain bikes that pair lower power motors with smaller batteries. Add a range extender external battery pack for even bigger days.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3.jpg\" alt=\"2024 ari nebo peak lightweight eMTB shown from front angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-ari-nebo-peak-lightweight-eMTB-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The trail/all-mountain model gets 140mm rear travel with 150mm forks.
