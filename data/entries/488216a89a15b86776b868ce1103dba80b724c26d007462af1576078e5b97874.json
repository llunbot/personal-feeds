It holds that when the meaning of a law is disputed, the federal agencyâ€™s interpretation should be given deference as long as it is reasonable. Environmental groups fear that overturning the precedent will make it easier for courts to block new pollution regulations, especially those addressing climate change.</p>\n<p>The cases heard on Wednesday, <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em>, and <em>Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce</em>, take on rules put into place in 2020 that require industry-funded federal observers aboard vessels in the northern Atlantic fishing for herring.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996932#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996932&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"488216a89a15b86776b868ce1103dba80b724c26d007462af1576078e5b97874","category":"Tech"}
