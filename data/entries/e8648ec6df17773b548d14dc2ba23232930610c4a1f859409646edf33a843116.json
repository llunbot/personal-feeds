Transmission derailleurs simply require ~30mm in diameter flat on both sides. That’s pretty standard on carbon bikes. And alloy bikes with big machined dropouts can also easily make that work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But many quality steel and titanium bikes use much smaller (often hooded or flat plate dropouts), optimized to weld or braze-on small diameter seatstays &amp; chainstays. And they simply don’t have enough free real estate to work with UDH. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it’s possible to make it work.

Sour says it’s about <em>15%</em> smaller overall. That lets them fit it into a compact hooded dropout, and doesn’t get in the way of their integral rack/fender mount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the outside, there’s just an alloy spacer since steel dropouts aren’t 13mm thick. Because, steel is just stronger, so they don’t need to be so wide, and can save quite a bit of weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Not-UDH almost universal derailleur hanger Transmission direct mount compatibility for steel bikes, renderings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings-297x161.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings-768x416.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>early Sour R&amp;D rendering showing their slimmer steel dropout (orange), their Not-UDH (red) &amp; its spacer (gray)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, unlike the SRAM UDH which is partly plastic, the Sour Not-UDH is entirely made of machined aluminum. So, the Sour one might even offer more precise shifts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Of note</em>: Sour’s Not-Quite-UDH is all aluminum – much like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-robert-axle-project-machined-alloy-udh-replacement-derailleur-hanger/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Axle</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wheels-mfg-adds-bright-new-bb-udh-colors-e-bike-chainring-lockring-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">Wheels Mfg</a>‘s all-alloy UDH replacements. Sour’s also uses a standard M17x1 lefthand thread pitch to assemble the 2 hanger halves. A big driver of this was simplified manufacturing. But also, a lot of people (<em>qualified bike shops included</em>) have been breaking some of SRAM UDHs when installing them. A good portion of that might be because of the high UDH torque rating, the non-standard left-hand thread pitch between the bolt &amp; hanger, and the fact that many (<em>most?</em>) torque wrenches weirdly enough don’t work or are inaccurate for reverse threads. That and the fact that they are about half plastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-updated-almost-UDH-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-updated-almost-UDH-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sour NOT-UDH almost universal derailleur hanger Transmission direct mount compatibility for steel bikes, comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-updated-almost-UDH-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-updated-almost-UDH-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-updated-almost-UDH-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-1536x960.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-updated-almost-UDH-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-updated-almost-UDH-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Sour Not-UDH left vs. SRAM UDH right (<em>Bikerumor composite</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some more bits of ‘universal’ hassles… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that the SRAM UDH hanger is a ‘standard’ and works with 12mm x 1.0 thread pitch thru-axles. But some OEMs use the UDH interface, but their own hangers have a different thru-axle pitch (since that’s not technically part of the agreed-upon ‘standard’). Why some would use a M12x1.75 axle inside a UDH is inexplicable to me, but it exists. Sour sticks with M12x1, like SRAM, and like all of SRAM’s Transmission derailleurs (which also curiously each have different assembly bolts, presumably because of slightly different hangers integrated into each T-type derailleur).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-Pasta-Party-MTB-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-Pasta-Party-MTB-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Sour Not-UDH almost universal derailleur hanger Transmission direct mount compatibility for steel bikes, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-Pasta-Party-MTB-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-Pasta-Party-MTB-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-Pasta-Party-MTB-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-Pasta-Party-MTB-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-Pasta-Party-MTB-detail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last bit is that SRAM’s standard UDH solution is not <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=tailfin\" target=\"_blank\">Tailfin</a>-friendly, because they require special axles that extend through the hanger (or T-type derailleurs) to mount the unique bikepacking racks. Since Sour is popular among bikepackers and adventure cyclists, they reworked their axles to bolt together with a 12mm hex wrench as soon as they realized this issue. So, many of the photos I have to illustrate this show a 8mm hex interface, but they’re now building bikes with the 12mm (and a 8mm adapter) and will send the new bolt to everyone who needs it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-MTB-dropouts.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-MTB-dropouts.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Not-UDH almost universal derailleur hanger Transmission direct mount compatibility for steel bikes, in the workshop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-MTB-dropouts.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-MTB-dropouts-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-MTB-dropouts-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_made-in-Germany-MTB-dropouts-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the Sour ‘Almost-UDH’ is “100% Transmission compatible”, since SRAM direct mount derailleurs don’t make contact with the portion with the fin anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sour Not-Quite-UDH – Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Sour-Not-Quite-UDH-on-steel-bikes_more-universal-compatibility_Purple-Haze-frameset-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Sour-Not-Quite-UDH-on-steel-bikes_more-universal-compatibility_Purple-Haze-frameset-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sour Not-Quite-UDH for steel bikes, more universal compatibility, Purple Haze frameset detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Sour-Not-Quite-UDH-on-steel-bikes_more-universal-compatibility_Purple-Haze-frameset-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Sour-Not-Quite-UDH-on-steel-bikes_more-universal-compatibility_Purple-Haze-frameset-detail-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Sour-Not-Quite-UDH-on-steel-bikes_more-universal-compatibility_Purple-Haze-frameset-detail-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Sour-Not-Quite-UDH-on-steel-bikes_more-universal-compatibility_Purple-Haze-frameset-detail-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-Sour-Not-Quite-UDH-on-steel-bikes_more-universal-compatibility_Purple-Haze-frameset-detail-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All new made-in-Germany Sour frames welded since last fall feature the new Not-UDH dropout.
