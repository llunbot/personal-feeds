{"title":"‘How Telegram Played Itself’","link":"https://www.platformer.news/telegram-durov-arrest-france-explainer/","date":1724777949000,"content":"\n<p>Casey Newton, writing at Platformer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Telegram is often described as an “encrypted” messenger. But as\nBen Thompson <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/telegram-ceo-arrested-telegrams-non-encrypted-advantage-telegram-complexities/\">explains today</a>, Telegram is not end-to-end\nencrypted, as rivals WhatsApp and Signal are. (Its “secret chat”\nfeature <em>is</em> end-to-end encrypted, but it is not enabled on chats\nby default. The vast majority of chats on Telegram are not secret\nchats.) That means Telegram can look at the contents of private\nmessages, making it vulnerable to law enforcement requests for\nthat data.</p>\n\n<p>Anticipating these requests, Telegram created a kind of\njurisdictional obstacle course for law enforcement that (it says)\nnone of them have successfully navigated so far. <a href=\"https://telegram.org/faq?ref=platformer.news#q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy\">From the FAQ\nagain</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption,\nTelegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is\nstored in multiple data centers around the globe that are\ncontrolled by different legal entities spread across different\njurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts\nand are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As\na result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are\nrequired to force us to give up any data. […] To this day, we\nhave disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including\ngovernments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a result, investigation after investigation finds that Telegram\nis a significant vector for the spread of CSAM. (To take only the\nmost recent example, <a href=\"https://www.boomlive.in/decode/csam-investigation-child-sexual-abuse-material-social-media-instagram-telegram-india-paedophiles-selling-videos-25848\">here’s one from India’s Decode last\nmonth</a>, which like others found that criminals often\nadvertise their wares on Instagram and direct buyers to Telegram\nto complete their purchases.) [...]</p>\n\n<p>“Telegram is another level,” Brian Fishman, Meta’s former\nanti-terrorism chief, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@brian.fishman.5/post/C_Gjo7lSoyh\"><em>a post on Threads</em></a>. “It has\nbeen the key hub for ISIS for a decade. It tolerates CSAM. Its\nignored reasonable [law enforcement] engagement for YEARS. It’s\nnot ‘light’ content moderation; it’s a different approach\nentirely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/telegram-ceo-arrested-telegrams-non-encrypted-advantage-telegram-complexities/\">From the Ben Thompson piece</a> yesterday that Newton links to above, is this description of just how unusual Telegram’s “secret chats” are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That is why “encryption” in the context of messaging means\nend-to-end encryption; this means that your messages are encrypted\non your device and can only ever be decrypted and thus read by\nyour intended recipient. Telegram does support this with “Secret\nChats”, but these are not the default. Moreover, Telegram’s\nimplementation has a lot of oddities, including some non-standard\nencryption techniques, the fact that secret chats can only be\nbetween two devices (not two accounts, so you can’t access a\nsecret chat started on your phone from your computer), and that\nboth users have to be online at the same time to initiate a secret\nchat (I’ll come back to these oddities in a moment).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/27/newton-telegram\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b4966e30a483256be8f75847cf93a48c9fc74cbadd71fab0361c574b9b9f5456","category":"Tech"}
