Doubling back on yourself is just silly, while riding up a huge hill only to immediately ride back down the same road is surely a sign that you have too much time on your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a defensible position, but if you’re overly dogmatic about it you’ll miss out on some absolute treasures. The Göscheneralp climb is one of them. It’s a ride all the way up a valley to a dead end, and it’s perhaps the least well-known yet most charming of the ascents in the Swiss Alps.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grimsel-pass-cycling\">Classic climb: Grimsel Pass, the Swiss climb that’s anything but grim</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/susten-pass-cycling\">Classic climb: Susten Pass, the supersized Swiss climb</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/furka-pass-cycling\">Classic climb: Furka Pass, the Swiss climb with the Midas touch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Gösch, it’s an Alp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The climb begins in Göschenen, a sleepy village that’s reachable by rail direct from Zurich in under two hours.

The ride ends at Göscheneralp, a small settlement best known for its sizeable hydroelectric dam and the pretty crystals locals extract from its rocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Göschenen is hemmed in by immense mountains and at 9am on a summer’s morning the air is sure to be chilly until the sun emerges, slicing down across the hillside. Getting out of town takes a matter of minutes and a brief foray into double-digit gradients gives a good indication of how you’ll fare on the rest of the climb.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This initial kick only lasts about a kilometre before you’re thrust into an agrarian idyll of meadows, livestock and barns, with inclines of between 2% and 5%. Cows wander onto the road flicking their tails, and the air hums with flies. The valley is near enough straight so there are glimpses of distant peaks framed by the forest that carpets its sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matters intensify again around the 3.5km mark, which is where the Göscheneralp reveals its true treasure, enveloping you in Alpine conifers as you pass between imposing walls of rock dripping with freezing mountain water. Some Swiss climbs are epic; some are simply gruelling; this one is stunningly pretty and reasonably steep, with the average for this section rarely dipping below 8%.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-970x645.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The narrow road gives it a more intimate feel than the mountain highways of the major passes.

New views are revealed by occasional hairpins, but there are just six in total, all within the second half – it’s a fairly steady affair.

Don’t let that put you off. Part of its appeal is that it’s a dead end – so there’s no through traffic – and it attracts more hikers than petrolheads. You can go minutes at a time without seeing another soul, and that solitude is a rare treat in a part of the world that’s understandably popular with tourists.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/classic-climb-goscheneralp-11.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The dam at the summit contains 76 million cubic metres of distinctively coloured Swiss water.</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>You’ll never feel short-changed.
