In making its decision, the Copyright Office committed to upholding the longstanding legal definition that authors of creative works must be human to register works. Because of this, officials confirmed that AI technologies can never be considered authors.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t the only case influencing new guidance, but it was the most recent. Wrestling with the comic book's complex authorship questions helped prompt the Copyright Office to launch an agency-wide initiative to continue exploring a wider range of copyright issues arising as the AI models that are used to generate text, art, audio, and video continue evolving.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924741#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924741&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f74f33ddd2decc302fad5fd4d1edae15adf083ea0a4a7dbd295f9e0110d7ff35","category":"Tech"}
