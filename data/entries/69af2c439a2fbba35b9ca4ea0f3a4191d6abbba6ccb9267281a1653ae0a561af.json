It's about Nintendo, and I should start by making abundantly clear that I didn't get the information double-checked or verified by anyone who has particular access or insight into the gaming company's plans (neither did I ask my uncle who—promise, swear—works as Mario's personal driver).</p>\n<p>But I have been turning over this minuscule scrap of information in my mind ever since. What I heard is both simultaneously a resounding \"duh\" for a company like Nintendo and yet also possibly illuminating about the industry giant's near-future plans.
