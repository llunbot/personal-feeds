{"title":"Good Riddance to Apple’s FineWoven Cases","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-finewoven-cases/","date":1725988359000,"content":"\n<p>Juli Clover, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple today discontinued its ill-received FineWoven material, introducing no new cases that use the leather replacement. The company has also removed existing FineWoven iPhone cases for older devices from its website, though FineWoven versions of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA7A4ZM/A/iphone-finewoven-wallet-with-magsafe-blackberry\">MagSafe Wallet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA7J4ZM/A/airtag-finewoven-key-ring-dark-green\">AirTag Key Ring</a> continue to be available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know what’s a great material for phone cases? Leather. Apple is so damn good at material engineering — I truly expect them to, sooner rather than later, come up with a leather-like non-leather that’s as good or better than actual leather. But FineWoven sure as shit wasn’t it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/10/fine-woven-good-riddance\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"aed7505ec86da786689e8a1ac11c5fb7c5315eb3f493f4b47686b96c4e7cba1e","category":"Tech"}
