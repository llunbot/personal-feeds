The conference, \"Global Conference on Mobile App Ecosystem Fairness,\" kicks off on Monday, November 15, in Seoul, South Korea.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSouth Korea has been the scene of recent legislation that could change the ‌App Store‌ in fundamental ways. Earlier in August, South Korea <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-app-store-bill/\">passed a bill</a> that prohibits Apple, and other owners of mobile app distribution platforms, from forcing developers to use their own payment method. For the ‌App Store‌, that would result in Apple no longer requiring developers to use its in-app purchase system.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has said the new change would put users at risk, decrease user trust in purchases made within apps, and make it harder for certain features, such as parental controls, to be implemented.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like \"Ask to Buy\" and Parental Controls will become less effective. We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this legislation — leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.</blockquote>Following the passage of the bill, ‌Epic Games‌ had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-fortnite-south-korea/\">asked Apple to reinstate Fortnite onto the App Store</a> in South Korea. Fortnite was removed from the ‌App Store‌ in August of 2020 after Epic implemented a direct-payment method for in-app purchases, a clear violation of Apple's ‌App Store‌ rules. The new law in South Korea is yet to go into effect, and even when it does, Apple had said that it has no obligation to reinstate Epic's developer account that was terminated prior to when it became law.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/11/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-speak-app-store-conference/\">Epic Games CEO to Speak in South Korea Next Week Against the App Store Amid Ongoing Tensions With Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-ceo-to-speak-in-south-korea-next-week-against-the-app-store-amid-ongoing-tensions-with-apple.2322880/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S3-AAw0vHRo:Ct63Yh68Ktw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S3-AAw0vHRo:Ct63Yh68Ktw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"62c2a56729e18bd53ff71cab8017365a5712d7f1c39fc19ef232bcb2b5cac5b4","category":"Apple"}
