It's based on the hugely popular manga series of the same name. </p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The heady world of fine wine is often justly skewered as being hopelessly elitist and pretentious, where rare bottles sell for tens of thousands of dollars, their flavors and aromas described in florid, over-the-top language that readily lends itself to satire. (The sommelier in last year's delightful <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/ars-technicas-favorite-films-in-2022/4/\"><em>The Menu</em></a> described a pinot noir as having \"notes of longing and regret.\")</p>\n<p>That's the pop culture caricature, at least. If you yearn for something that brings this rarefied world firmly down to earth and celebrates wine's role in forging human bonds and shaping culture at large, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2w3ju2a6\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Drops of God</em></a>, a limited miniseries that debuted on Apple TV+ in April. It is based on the popular and influential manga of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drops_of_God\">same name</a>. This is a series that sticks with you, its most memorable moments lingering in one's mind the way a good wine lingers on the palate.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below but no major reveals.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951631#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951631&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"38fc211c7a0eea584f4b1aff1abd63ff98b73a3ee1bd1fe40a231870d4af7622","category":"Tech"}
