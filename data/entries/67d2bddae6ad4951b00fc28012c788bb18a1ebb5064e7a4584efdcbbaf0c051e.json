{"title":"MotionMark Moves to Open Governance","link":"https://webkit.org/blog/14359/motionmark-moves-to-open-governance/","date":1686585653000,"content":"<p>The WebKit team <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/6943/motionmark-a-new-graphics-benchmark/\">created</a> the <a href=\"https://browserbench.org/MotionMark1.2/\">MotionMark benchmark</a> in 2016 to measure graphics performance of web browsers. In the 7 years since then, it has proven to be a critical tool to help us guide our graphics performance improvements. It’s been successful not just for WebKit, but also for other browser engines, which have used it to help direct their own work. It is now the industry-standard benchmark for graphics on the web.</p>\n<p>This is why we’re opening up MotionMark to the browser community and migrating to a <a href=\"https://github.com/WebKit/MotionMark/blob/main/Governance.md\">new governance model</a>. This new model is designed so that browser engine developers can collaboratively improve MotionMark together and is based on the governance model of the popular Speedometer benchmark.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to work with the browser community to develop MotionMark further! Please feel free to file issues at <a href=\"http://github.com/WebKit/MotionMark\">github.com/WebKit/MotionMark</a>, and please get involved!</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Blog – WebKit","siteHash":"7f8dbea0b8f53db2e11a2faa08c6dca9954c01638d09a2ce585b77a60d10f7a1","entryHash":"67d2bddae6ad4951b00fc28012c788bb18a1ebb5064e7a4584efdcbbaf0c051e","category":"Tech"}
