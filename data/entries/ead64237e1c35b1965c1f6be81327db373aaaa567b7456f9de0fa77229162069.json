In September, the company will unveil its new iPhones and Apple Watches, which are accompanied by new versions of iOS/iPadOS and watchOS. On occasion, there will be other devices announced, too, such as AirPods or iPads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The betas for the new operating systems are in full swing, and Apple has even begun the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1</a> and macOS 15.1, where Apple Intelligence will first become available. Those betas will continue, and become more polished, throughout August as we approach the new OS releases in September. Here’s everything we expect to see from Apple this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s very unlikely that Apple will release anything new this month. The last time Apple launched anything in August was way back in 2007 when the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/666312/imac-2007-review.html\">aluminum iMac</a> made its debut—so yeah, it’s been a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it won’t be a long wait. September is when Apple unveils its new iPhones and Apple Watches, so be on the lookout all month for rumors. We’ve already seen lots of rumors of the iPhone 16 line and Apple Watch Series 10, and those will ramp up in August, along with later hardware (iPads and Macs) that might be released in October. This is what we know so far:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a></strong>: The iPhone 16 will sport a new processor, new colors, a vertical camera arrangement, the Action button, and a new Camera button. The Pro models will get a slightly larger display with even slimmer bezels, faster charging, and better cameras, in addition to the new Camera button and a new processor. As the unveiling approaches, we expect more reliable leaks about design and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a></strong>: We don’t expect much in the way of major updates to the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3, with one exception—the latest rumors say the Series 10 will expand the display size by a few millimeters, giving the larger model a display size nearly as big as the Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple dropped <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2370130/ios-17-6-beta-features-release-date.html\">iOS 17.6</a>, iPadOS 17.6, watchOS 10.6, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2370203/macos-sonoma-14-6-features-security-fixes-install-html.html\">macOS 14.6</a> at the end of July, with <em>dozens</em> of security vulnerabilities patched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the summer beta testing of iOS 18, macOS 15, and the other big fall operating system updates continues. In addition, there’s a separate beta for the x.1 releases for, which bring the first set of Apple Intelligence features, but it’s only for the devices that support AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 18/iPadOS 18:</strong> We expect these to arrive around the second week of September, with new customization features for the Home screen, a major Photos app redesign, new Messages features, RCS support, and lots more. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18 superguide</a> for an overview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS 15:</strong> Apple’s Sequoia upgrade brings iPhone mirroring, new video conferencing tools, new Safari features, the Passwords app, and a host of other features. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia superguide</a> for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 18.1/iPadOS 18.1:</strong> These betas introduce the first Apple Intelligence features, currently limited to iPhone 15 Pro and M-series iPads. They’ll continue throughout August, making improvements and fixing bugs, and even through September as Apple works its way toward a likely October launch. After their release, we expect all iPhone 16 models to be compatible.
