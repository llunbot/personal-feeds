They’re pretty inexpensive normally, but this Amazon sale makes them a downright bargain: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY/\">You can get a 4-pack of AIrTags for $64.49 today</a>, a savings of $35.51, and a new all-time-low for this bundle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We love these tiny Bluetooth trackers and gave them a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346345/apple-airtag-review.html\">four-star rating</a> when we reviewed them a while back. We found they have an excellent design and they’re super easy to set up and track with the Find My network. Another thing we really appreciate is the fact that you can swap out the battery to change it up when it’s time. When these trackers are within range, you can track their location on the map. If you have an iPhone with an ultra-wideband chip you’ll be able to pinpoint the location or you can get them to make a sound when you’re nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When out of Bluetooth range, your items can still be tracked as long using the vast FindMy network. Since the tags are IP67 water- and dust-resistant, it won’t even matter if you drop your keys in the park. And with separation alerts, your phone will let you know when you’re about to leave something behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go get yourself some peace of mind with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY/\">four AirTags for $70 at Amazon</a> because this deal won’t stick around forever.</p>\n\n\n<span>That's $16.12 for an AirTag</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7605bf788542199b22c85997f9dfdd49c04ca479416aae7de7e6f90cfb755cd3","category":"Apple"}
