All Garmin bike computers contain GPS chips, so at the very minimum will let you know where you’ve been, how far you’ve ridden and at what speed.</p>\n<p>However, while lower-end models such as the Edge 130 will give you a breadcrumb-style trail, more advanced computers such as the Edge 530, Edge 830 and Edge 1040 Solar will offer extra features such as turn-by-navigation and route recalculation.</p>\n<p>Take a look at our full <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/garmin-edge-bike-computers-buyers-guide-to-all-the-models/\">Garmin Edge bike computers buyer’s guide</a> for a more detailed lowdown on the Edge range.</p>\n<p>Garmin’s wearables, by contrast, are more focused on fitness and health, and there are a lot out there. The brand has six ranges of smartwatch, although there’s plenty of overlap in terms of specs and features.</p>\n<p>Basic features across nearly every model include step counting, sleep monitoring and smartphone notifications. As the models advance, they incorporate extra features such as not just tracking your heart rate but also measuring VO2 max and lactate threshold.</p>\n<p>The good news is that as the technology in both categories advances, the basic models are capable of more and more. So our advice is to not overreach beyond your budget, and to prioritise what’s most important to you.</p>\n<p>Are you looking to improve your ride performance by tracking your stats? Or are you looking for a wayfinder on your ride that’s more built-for-purpose than your smartphone?</p>\n<p>For more guidance on which device will best suit your needs, check out our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-computer-vs-smartphone-vs-smartwatch/\">bike computers vs smartphones vs smartwatches</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to get a good deal on Black Friday</h3>\n<p>Deals should never be taken at face value – they’re not necessarily the bargains they might first appear to be. Read on for a few tips in spotting genuinely good Black Friday Garmin deals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a spot of pre-deal research. See what the experts, who have tested a product, have to say about it before you commit to buying. Head to our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/garmin/\">Garmin reviews and news</a> page for information about the latest products</li>\n<li>Put together a wishlist of items. Of course, you might get inspired while browsing and find an unexpected perfect <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-gifts/\">cycling Christmas gift</a> for someone – but remember that retailers and markets do an exceptional job of convincing you to buy something you don’t necessarily want</li>\n<li>As mentioned, don’t assume a deal is genuinely good just because you see a huge discount against an RRP. The product might well have not been at the RRP price for months or even years prior – the best way to get around this is to take note of product prices way ahead of Black Friday</li>\n<li>Shop around – if you see what looks like an amazing deal, add it to your shopping basket. But before you pay at the checkout, have a quick look at Google’s price results to check it’s not cheaper elsewhere. And don’t forget that retailers such as Currys and John Lewis promise to match prices, so hold them to it!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Should I wait for Cyber Monday?</h3>\n<p>Cyber Monday, as the name suggests, has always been something exclusively online. But as online shopping has increased, we imagine there will be less of a clear-cut divide between Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.</p>\n<p>Our advice this year is to not hang on until Cyber Monday to see if an already-discounted product drops any further in price. With so many more people shopping online, products are likely to sell out even faster.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f9cf8f6379554d68b5102f341e42da260b2914c01fe9f19c8db28629bf540d3a","category":"Cycling"}
