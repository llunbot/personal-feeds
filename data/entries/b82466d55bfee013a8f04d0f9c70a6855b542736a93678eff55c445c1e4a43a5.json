Fully integrated cable routing has fully taken over modern bikes. It’s not limited to one frame material or the other. And not really limited by discipline either. So if you are going to have to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/what-bike-mechanics-really-think-about-internal-cable-routing-headsets/\" target=\"_blank\">run your brake and shift lines through your headset</a>, you might as well give your bike a US-made headset built to last a lifetime…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Chris King AeroSet 1 &amp; 2 integrated internal routing headsets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King AeroSet 1 2 integrated internal routing headsets, in a Time carbon gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gravel-cockpit.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Chris King)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More custom frame builder and production bikemakers are adopting fully internal cable routing. And while Chris King wasn’t quite an early adopter, they do make some of the cycling industry’s longest-lasting and most desireable headsets. And Chris King is catching up. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_top-down-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_top-down-view-1536x922.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King AeroSet 1 2 integrated internal routing headset, top view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_top-down-view-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_top-down-view-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_top-down-view-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_top-down-view-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_top-down-view.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We first spotted this AeroSet 2 three years ago in the US-made carbon ENVE <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-builds-the-complete-carbon-package-with-new-custom-road-bikes-built-to-order/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Road</a>.  Then, the external <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-aeroset-brings-full-internal-cable-integration-to-classic-headsets/\" target=\"_blank\">AeroSet 3</a> a year and a half later in Moots’ titanium <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-moots-cycles-vamoots-crd-dedicated-road-bicycle-titanium/\" target=\"_blank\">Vamoots CRD</a> road bike. First, you had to be a custom builder developing a bike with Chris King to get one. Then, the classic external cups option made it more possible for more builders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked last year what happened to number one, and were told to be patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now it’s here, and three options are on offer – with steel or ceramic bearings…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headset-in-Violet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1382\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headset-in-Violet-1536x1382.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King AeroSet 1 2 integrated internal routing headset in Violet purple\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headset-in-Violet-1536x1382.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headset-in-Violet-297x267.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headset-in-Violet-120x108.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headset-in-Violet-768x691.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headset-in-Violet.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s new is though really, is just that you can actually get an integrated routing headset for your bike now. Both of these new options are made for modern 1.5″ tapered steerer bikes with IS (Integrated System) headsets – IS52/IS52. Those are the ones where you drop the 1.5″ headset bearings directly into the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new AeroSet 1 is for 45°x45° bearing-to-race interface top and bottom. AeroSet 2 uses the same upper bearing and hardware, but a 36°x45° degree interface for the lower bearing. That’s it. That’s the difference for the model we had been missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gets-GripLock.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gets-GripLock-1536x922.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King AeroSet 1 2 integrated internal routing headsets, in a Time carbon gravel bike, GripLock tech\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gets-GripLock-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gets-GripLock-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gets-GripLock-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gets-GripLock-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Time-gets-GripLock.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both new versions of the Chris King AeroSet share King’s unique GripLock isolated wedge tech. That guards your fork’s carbon steerer and the bearings themselves from excessive loads. Welcome protection whether you ride an ultralight bike or send your burly mountain bike off big hits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, designed and manufactured in Portland, Oregon and backed by Chris King’s lifetime warranty</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Chris King AeroSet – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-3-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_now-three-options.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-3-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_now-three-options-1536x614.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King AeroSet 1 2 integrated internal routing headsets, colro options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-3-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_now-three-options-1536x614.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-3-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_now-three-options-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-3-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_now-three-options-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-3-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_now-three-options-768x307.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-3-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_now-three-options-2048x819.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Chris King AeroSet 1 &amp; 2 headsets are gradually rolling out now in the full rainbow array for King’s anodized color palette. Additionally, they are available with standard steel bearings for ​$295, or for ​$415 with an upgrade to ceramic bearings. They feature the same upper headset bearing cap and internal routing guides as the AeroSet 3. Built to seamlessly pair with ENVE In Route and FSA ACR integrated internal cable routing systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_ENVE-MOG-AeroSet-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_ENVE-MOG-AeroSet-2.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King AeroSet 1 2 integrated internal routing headsets, ENVE Mog\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_ENVE-MOG-AeroSet-2.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_ENVE-MOG-AeroSet-2-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_ENVE-MOG-AeroSet-2-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_ENVE-MOG-AeroSet-2-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Baum-side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Baum-side.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King AeroSet 1 2 integrated internal routing headsets, Baum\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Baum-side.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Baum-side-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Baum-side-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chris-King-AeroSet-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets_Baum-side-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Made in USA, the new AeroSet 1 &amp; 2 already fit bikes from Argonaut, Baum, ENVE, Time, and likely quite a few more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrisking.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ChrisKing.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-aeroset-1-2-integrated-internal-routing-headsets/\">Chris King AeroSet 1, 2, 3… Fully Integrated Cable Routing For All in More Headset Options</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b82466d55bfee013a8f04d0f9c70a6855b542736a93678eff55c445c1e4a43a5","category":"Cycling"}
