The reason? It's potentially the first time anyone can download a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/\">GPT-4-class</a> large language model (LLM) for free and run it on their own hardware. You'll still need some beefy hardware: Meta says it can run on a \"single server node,\" which isn't desktop PC-grade equipment. But it's a provocative shot across the bow of \"closed\" AI model vendors such as OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p>\"Llama 3.1 405B is the first openly available model that rivals the top AI models when it comes to state-of-the-art capabilities in general knowledge, steerability, math, tool use, and multilingual translation,\" <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_content=video&amp;utm_campaign=llama31\">says</a> Meta. Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls 405B \"the first frontier-level open source AI model.\"</p>\n<p>In the AI industry, \"frontier model\" is a term for an AI system designed to push the boundaries of current capabilities. In this case, Meta is positioning 405B among the likes of the industry's top AI models, such as OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/\">GPT-4o</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/\">Claude's 3.5 Sonnet</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/\">Google Gemini 1.5 Pro</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038486#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038486&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3d9700219060620dbc6eb1d3977b851ccf3c2c35169cea090b492c381856c125","category":"Tech"}
