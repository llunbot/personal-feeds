Clothing-specific brands come to mind first, but I am happy I tried out Yeti’s gear as I came away pretty impressed with every piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yeti-27-5-sb135-mountain-bike-review/\">SB135</a></strong> trail bike I reviewed this summer, Yeti sent me a package with shorts, gloves, plus short and long-sleeved jerseys. Right away I found everything fit me very well, and I like the brand’s subdued style. In the end I found all the pieces great performers too, with even the lightest garments proving to be highly durable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Freeland Short:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-Shorts-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1224\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-Shorts-front.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Freeland shorts, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-Shorts-front.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-Shorts-front-294x300.jpg 294w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-Shorts-front-800x816.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-Shorts-front-118x120.jpg 118w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-Shorts-front-768x783.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Revised for 2023, Yeti’s Freeland shorts are their best-selling short offering plenty of storage, lots of ventilation, and an overall trim fit with generous leg length. At 5’10” I’m wearing size small shorts, and the 14” inseams easily reach the bottom of my kneecaps. While the legs are not baggy, the lower hems leave ample room for knee pads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles kit, SF, rockslab\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-rock-slab-econoline-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Freeland shorts’ main fabric offers two-way stretch, but their cut alone provides great mobility. Yeti thoughtfully incorporated a gusseted crotch, leaving a seamless panel where your body and saddle meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These shorts offer two waist pockets and two zippered leg pockets, both with lightweight mesh linings. They also include a pair of zippered vents on the front of both legs. These vents do add extra airflow on the trail, and they don’t get snagged on knee pads when left open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hardly rains in the summers where I live, so I didn’t get to test this but the Freeland shorts do have a C0 DWR finish.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Freeland shorts, waist adjuster\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-waist-adjuster.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Freeland shorts fit me really well, mostly thanks to the sizing and the clever waist adjusters. Small but effective, the adjusters are simple to use (just tug the webbing and they snug up), and they don’t loosen up as you ride. The small shorts I tested fit up to 31” waists, which I can cinch in without any bunching.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Freeland shorts, vents\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Freeland-shorts-vents-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My only minor issue with the shorts is the leg vent zippers: I put the shorts on one morning and felt the cold zippers touching my legs. A little fabric to keep them off your bare skin would be a nice finishing touch.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP for the Freeland shorts is $115. Men’s sizes go from S-XXL, and there are four color options (including Dusty Purple, as tested).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Longhorn SS Jersey:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles kit, SF, Nimby\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-Nimby-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeti’s Longhorn SS jersey won me over with a fit that matches my slim build perfectly. The size small jersey I tested is fairly lean in the body, but offers a generous length with a dropped tail that easily keeps me covered in riding position. The arms almost reach my elbows, providing good sun protection, and I like simple rounded collars like the Longhorn’s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built to perform in warm weather, the Longhorn SS jersey features an updated 4-way stretch knit polyester body fabric, and light perforated panels under the arms. The inside of the jersey uses a Microgrid texture so it won’t cling to sweaty skin (which doesn’t feel noticeably different from other polyester jerseys).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1595\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Longhorn jersey, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front-226x300.jpg 226w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front-800x1063.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front-768x1021.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Longhorn-SS-jersey-front-1156x1536.jpg 1156w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This jersey has no pockets but includes a sunglass/goggle wipe stitched on the inside of the lower hem (left side). If you ride with a pack, you’ll be pleased to know Yeti kept the shoulders and back panel totally seamless. After several rides with a camera pack and many washes, the Longhorn SS jersey has resisted warping and isn’t showing any visible wear on the back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Longhorn SS Jersey sells for $70. Men’s sizes range from S-XXL, and there are four color/sublimated graphic options including the ‘Dusty Purple Fade’ I tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tolland SS Jersey:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-SS-jersey-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1524\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-SS-jersey-front.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Tolland SS jersey, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-SS-jersey-front.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-SS-jersey-front-236x300.jpg 236w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-SS-jersey-front-800x1016.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-SS-jersey-front-94x120.jpg 94w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-SS-jersey-front-768x975.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like simple t-shirt-style jerseys, the Tolland SS keeps things trim and basic to keep you cool in the saddle. This jersey is a lightweight option with a quick-drying 4-way stretch fabric and a highly breathable mesh back panel. With hot weather in mind, the jersey also offers 30+ UPF protection and includes a HeiQ Pure anti-odor treatment.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tolland jersey has very subtle styling, with just one tiny logo on the left arm. It does not have pockets, but includes a sunglass/goggle wipe seamlessly tacked to the inside of the waist hem (on the left side).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles clothing, SF, trail sign\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-kit-SF-trail-sign-1024x1536.jpg 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tolland jersey fits a lot like the Longhorn SS above, with a fairly lean body that’s long enough to ensure good coverage. The Tolland’s sleeves seem a bit longer than the Longhorn’s, reaching right to my elbows. It has proven quite durable, with no warping or wear and tear from packs to report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tolland jersey sells for $65. Men get four color options, including the ‘Limestone’ grey I tested. Sizes range from S-XXL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tolland LS Jersey:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Tolland LS jersey, on trail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Tolland-LS-jersey-on-trail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For a full coverage option, Yeti offers the Tolland LS jersey. This jersey shares most construction features with the short-sleeved version above. It gets the moisture-wicking 4-way stretch fabric, seamless sunglass wipe at the hem, 30+ UPF sun protection, and anti-odor treatment. The long-sleeved Tolland jersey does not have a mesh back panel, but it features perforated mesh panels under the arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tolland LS’ styling is very simple with solid colors and just one small logo on the left cuff. Like the above jerseys, it has resisted warping in the wash and wear and tear from backpacks impressively well. Yeti’s fit is consistent, with the small Tolland LS offering ample body length and a lean cut. The sleeves are perfect for me, easily keeping my arms fully covered while riding without excess length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tolland LS jersey costs $80, and comes in men’s sizes S-XXL. Color options are Black or Evergreen (as tested).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enduro Glove:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Enduro gloves, pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-gloves-pair-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With their ultralight mesh backsides, Yeti’s Enduro Gloves were my top choice for the hottest rides this summer. A minimalist glove with no added protection features, the Enduro Gloves kept my hands as cool as possible while providing basic coverage. Keeping things light, these slip-on style gloves have no wrist closure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The slim but durable AX Suede palms offer a precise grip feel with no padding. A light mesh material between the fingers ensures good ventilation, and the thumb and forefingers are conductive for smartphone compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Enduro glove, backside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Enduro-glove-backside-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m wearing the Enduro Gloves in size Medium, and they fit very nicely. The finger length is perfect, and the cuffs are on the short side but just long enough to cover my wrists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found these gloves perfectly comfortable: I never had any issues with bunching, uncomfortable seams, etc. My gloves are showing no excess wear or damage after quite a few rides this summer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeti’s Enduro Glove retails for $32. Men’s sizes range from S-XL, and women’s sizes go from XS-L. Men get six color options (including Dusty Purple Fade, as tested), and women get four color choices. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Maverick Glove:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Maverick gloves, pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-gloves-pair-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Maverick glove is Yeti’s most protective option, featuring thermoplastic rubber logos and patterns. The rubber bits cover the outer sides of the gloves and extend down the pinky finger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The durable back material offers a bit of stretch, but you won’t get a second-skin-like feel from these gloves. Aside from between the fingers, there’s no light mesh or vent panels, so they’re not the coolest option but are still reasonable for all temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Velcro wrist closure, these gloves provide a very secure fit; they do not bunch, budge, or shift around at all while riding. The wrist closure is fairly small and never irritated me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The palms use a slim AX Suede fabric, providing a good grip feel with no bunching. Other features include soft nose wipe panels on the thumbs and conductive fingertips for easy smartphone use.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip.jpg\" alt=\"Yeti Cycles Maverick glove, on grip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yeti-Maverick-glove-on-grip-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I have size medium Maverick gloves, and they fit me perfectly. Finger length is consistent with the Enduro Gloves above, but the cuff extends slightly further on these gloves. After many rides I have no comfort issues to report, and have not done any damage to them either. The Maverick Glove sells for $38, and comes in XS-XL sizes. Color options are Asphalt, Turquoise or Syrah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://yeticycles.com/\">yeticycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yeti-mtb-shorts-jersey-gloves-clothing-review/\">Yeti’s MTB Clothing Fits Great, with Subtle Styling &amp; a Durable Construction</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b6ec0716b140c93e75a12ca28f29851ff26682edfc92eeb344be2697b89267fa","category":"Cycling"}
