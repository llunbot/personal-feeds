The <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/susie-w-longbolts-wolbis-slugstone\" target=\"_blank\">Susie W. Longbolts/ Wolbis Slugstone</a> and it’s heavier-duty cousin, the<a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/gus-boots-willsen\" target=\"_blank\"> Gus Boots Willsen</a>, are what Rivendell refers to as “hillibikes.” Their design is modern, but their overall concept is influenced by early mountain bikes ridden on Mt Tamalpais, north of San Fransisco, in the ’80s. And, by the way, their names are all anagrams of each other. Rivendell had a decked-out Wolbis at this year’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/philly-bike-expo/\" target=\"_blank\">Philly Bike Expo</a> where <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hopecyclery/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrod Bunk</a> caught up with them to photograph the build and learn more about these hillbikes from Rivendell’s Will Keating.<span></span></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Back in the ’80s, bikes and clothes were simple and people still managed to have lots of fun without pulling on full face helmets and flying off cliffs. We want these bikes to be used for passing through the landscape, not dominating it, and because that <em>seems</em> to be the mountain bike M.O these days, we made up our own hillibike category. There’s absolutely no chance hillbikes as a category will catch on at-large, but that’s OK.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-21.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The most obvious design feature is the long chainstays which add stability and make swept back bars like the <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/handlebar-tosco-bar-1\" target=\"_blank\">Tosco</a> shown here feel more natural as the rider’s weight is shifted rearward. The step-over top tube allows for a big headtube, which makes high bars easy, without sacrificing standover. This one has friction thumbies and our normal mix of 9 speed stuff; there’s nothing overly fancy about the parts, but it’s all super functional. The frames fit a 2.6″ tire, which is more than enough suspension for the type of trail riding we like.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-23.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The little disc above where the top tube meets the seat tube is a rare earth magnet, for sticking an hex key to. That’s a wrapped <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/zefal-hpx-frame-pump-black\" target=\"_blank\">Zefal</a> pump behind the seat tube and one of our <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/sackville-banana-sax?_pos=5&amp;_sid=b1c2734e7&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\">Bananasacks</a> underneath the Brooks saddle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>These frames, with the exception of the seat lug, are fillet brazed, which is in keeping with the best of the ’80s mountain bikes. Each frame takes a considerable amount of time to complete, so they’re more expensive than our lugged and tig-welded models.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-RIVENDELL-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>If you’re yearning to wax on even more about hillbikes, head over to the product description on Rivendell’s <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/susie-w-longbolts-wolbis-slugstone\">website</a> for more of a historical background and additional geometry notes.
