The high-end headphones are in stock on Adorama and ready to ship, and the retailer does offer some free shipping options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShoppers should note that there have been a few oddities on Adorama's website today, and you may notice the $100 off deal disappear when clicking through various colors on the retailer's page. Closing out and clicking back into the website through one of the links in this article does seem to help.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.adorama.com/acmgyn3ama.html?sterm=VuiS4dXBoxyLUM1RgPVQO14RUkByCHVeUzphy00&amp;EmailPrice=T&amp;utm_source=rflaid913058\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$100 OFF</div>AirPods Max for $449.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirPods Max feature Active Noise Cancellation technology and the same Transparency mode, Adaptive EQ, and spatial audio features that are in the AirPods Pro.
