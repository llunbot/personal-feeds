At the time, adults did not seem to take the harassment seriously, telling her to move on after she demanded more severe consequences than just a single boy's one or two-day suspension.</p>\n<p>Mani refused to take adults' advice, going over their heads to lawmakers who were more sensitive to her demands. And now, she's won her fight to criminalize deepfakes. On Wednesday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that he <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562025/approved/20250402a.shtml\">said</a> would help victims \"take a stand against deceptive and dangerous deepfakes\" by making it a crime to create or share fake AI nudes of minors or non-consenting adults—as well as deepfakes seeking to meddle with elections or damage any individuals' or corporations' reputations.</p>\n<p>Under the <a href=\"https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2024/A4000/3540_R3.PDF\">law</a>, victims targeted by nudify apps like Mani can sue bad actors, collecting up to $1,000 per harmful image created either knowingly or recklessly. New Jersey hopes these \"more severe consequences\" will deter kids and adults from creating harmful images, as well as emphasize to schools—whose lax response to fake nudes has been heavily criticized—that AI-generated nude images depicting minors are illegal and must be taken seriously and reported to police. It imposes a maximum fine of $30,000 on anyone creating or sharing deepfakes for malicious purposes, as well as possible punitive damages if a victim can prove that images were created in willful defiance of the law.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/adults-told-her-to-move-on-instead-teen-won-fight-to-criminalize-deepfakes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/adults-told-her-to-move-on-instead-teen-won-fight-to-criminalize-deepfakes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa2c9550882fcf0802ebc5c5e2df9e120ef1ab9460180ea1b296a2e4997fcb1a","category":"Tech"}
