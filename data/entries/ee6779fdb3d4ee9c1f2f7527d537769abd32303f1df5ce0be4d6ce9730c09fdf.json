After that, Russian cosmonauts aboard the station began preparing to open the hatches leading to Nauka, but at 11:34 am Houston time, Nauka unexpectedly started to fire its movement thrusters.</p>\n<p>Within minutes, the space station began to lose attitude control. This was a problem for several reasons. First of all, the station requires a certain attitude to maintain signal with geostationary satellites and talk to Mission Control on the ground. Also, solar arrays are positioned to collect power based upon this predetermined attitude.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784020#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784020&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ee6779fdb3d4ee9c1f2f7527d537769abd32303f1df5ce0be4d6ce9730c09fdf","category":"Tech"}
