Hiring enough manpower has been the \"biggest bottleneck\" to production at the manufacturing facility, according to the site's deputy general manager, Wang Xue, who was quoted by a local broadcaster. Earlier this month, it was reported that Foxconn was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/apple-suppliers-struggling-ahead-of-iphone-13/\">struggling to hire enough workers</a> for ‌iPhone 13‌ production.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe staffing goal is reportedly being supported by local governments, which have provided 100 busses to \"pick up job applicants from their communities and drop them at the factory gates.\" Foxconn believes that it will be able to hire 200,000 new hires by the end of September \"at the current speed of recruitment.\" Once hired, new workers will be fast-tracked into their position. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Zhengzhou factory can accommodate as many as 350,000 assembly line workers and manufacture up to 500,000 new iPhones every day. The current hiring push seeks to combat ramped-up production for the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ models, which are believed to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/iphone-13-release-date-timeframe/\">on track</a> for launch late next month.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/200000-more-workers-needed-for-iphone-13/\">200,000 More Workers Needed to Manufacture iPhone 13 Ahead of Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/200-000-more-workers-needed-to-manufacture-iphone-13-ahead-of-launch.2308738/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sOXWCi2W0dc:SelLPtMgrPw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sOXWCi2W0dc:SelLPtMgrPw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/sOXWCi2W0dc\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88842d6d3b0c5f113e53f6c168ef8a4af4b7861eee08ad0721c385e1bee3a0d5","category":"Apple"}
