{"title":"★ Why iPhone Names Have Numbers and Most Other Apple Product Names Don’t","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2021/09/iphone_names","date":1631212815000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1435292384439508994\">I conducted a poll on Twitter this week</a> asking what people think the new iPhones presumably being introduced <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/07/california-streaming-event\">next week</a> will be named. With over 4,600 votes, the results were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 13: 70%</li>\n<li>iPhone 12S: 12%</li>\n<li>iPhone (no more numbers): 15%</li>\n<li>Other: 3%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I probably asked a few days too late — there was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/06/iphone-13-pro-max-silicone-cases-leak/\">a credible leak</a> purporting to show the packages for “iPhone 13 Pro Max” silicone cases from Apple over the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>What intrigued me were the number of folks responding on Twitter who said that while they voted for “iPhone 13” as what they <em>would</em> be named, they <em>wish</em> that Apple would drop the numbers and just go with <em>iPhone</em>, <em>iPhone Mini</em>, <em>iPhone Pro</em>, and <em>iPhone Pro Max</em>, with implicit model years to tell them apart from new models in subsequent years. That’s basically how Apple names its other products — with the notable exception of Apple Watch (see below).</p>\n\n<p>But just plain “iPhone” wouldn’t work for iPhones, because iPhones are different. When Apple introduces a new iPad Pro, it <em>replaces</em> the previous iPad Pro. You can’t go into an Apple Store and buy a new 2018 iPad Pro. But you <em>can</em> buy a new iPhone XR from Apple today — a model that <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/the_iphone_xr\">was introduced in 2018</a>. (I’d wait until <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/07/california-streaming-event\">next Tuesday</a> before doing that.) Apple Watch is the only other product that’s sold like iPhones, with previous “series” sticking around for years at lower prices.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2021-09-09\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Apple wants people who are buying new iPhones that were first introduced 2–3 years ago to feel like they’re getting a new iPhone. They should, because they are — they’re great devices at lower prices, and will be supported for years to come. But if the iPhone XR were named “iPhone (2018)”, it’d feel old.</p>\n\n<p>I get it: it seems odd that in 10 years we might be awaiting the introduction of the iPhone 23 lineup, but at the moment, I don’t see this changing. <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/videos/how-bucs-beat-chiefs-mahomes-in-super-bowl-lv-no-risk-it-no-biscuit\">The NFL just keeps counting Super Bowls</a> — at least Apple only used Roman numerals for the X and XS/XR years.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Apple Watch numbering scheme is simple: new year, new series, incremented by one. The iPhone numbering scheme is not simple. There was no iPhone 2 — the second iPhone was named iPhone 3G. Thanks to the 3GS, the iPhone 4 was in fact the fourth model year. But then came the other “S” years: 4S, 5S, 6S, XS. And Apple skipped “iPhone 9” entirely. If Apple had stuck to a numbering scheme as simple as Apple Watch’s, next week’s new iPhones would be the iPhones 15. <a href=\"#fnr1-2021-09-09\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"995ade34817a7810cc9f37d4c125f7c93d7a50cde80853e85cf2669f134890bf","category":"Tech"}
