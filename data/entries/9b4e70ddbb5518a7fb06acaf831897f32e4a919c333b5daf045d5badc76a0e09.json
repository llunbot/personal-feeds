{"title":"Here's a Look at Apple's Secret Modem Testing Lab Where C1 Was Developed","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-c1-modem-lab/","date":1740180120000,"content":"The new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> includes Apple's first custom designed modem chip, the C1. To promote the new chip, Apple invited several YouTubers and journalists to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a>, including Andru Edwards. Edwards got a first-hand look at Apple's modem testing labs, and he was able to speak to Apple engineers about the C1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nAccording to Apple, the C1 is the most power efficient modem that's been included in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to date, and that's the edge that the C1 has over Qualcomm's modems. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ has the longest battery life of an ‌iPhone‌ with a 6.1-inch form factor, and it lasts for up to 26 hours when watching video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt Apple's modem testing labs, Apple engineers spent years testing the C1, determining how it would behave under various conditions using a range of equipment. Apple's testing lab allows it to identify and fix issues before a modem chip ever leaves the design stage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe C1 was tested in environmental chambers where it was exposed to different extreme temperatures to ensure that it can operate in the harshest conditions. Repeated physical tests also ensure that the chip is able to stand up to daily wear and tear. Network tests cover the heavy data traffic of a packed stadium to remote rural areas with minimal signal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple tested the C1 with over 180 carriers across 55 countries to ensure that it delivers reliable connectivity. The C1 is designed to integrate with the A18 chip, with the A18 able to optimize C1 network load for faster speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Apple, the C1 is built on a 4-nanometer processor for the baseband and a 7-nanometer process for the transceiver, and it is a robust platform that's built for the future. Right now, the C1 does not support the faster mmWave 5G speeds, but future versions are likely to add the functionality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors suggest that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apple-already-testing-a-c2-modem/\">next-generation C2 chip</a> is already in development for future ‌iPhone‌ models.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/c1/\">C1</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-c1-modem-lab/\">Here's a Look at Apple's Secret Modem Testing Lab Where C1 Was Developed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-a-look-at-apples-secret-modem-testing-lab-where-c1-was-developed.2449929/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b4e70ddbb5518a7fb06acaf831897f32e4a919c333b5daf045d5badc76a0e09","category":"Apple"}
