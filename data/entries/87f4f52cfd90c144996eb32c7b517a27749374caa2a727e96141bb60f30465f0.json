{"title":"MS Flight Simulator on consoles: Finally, a next-gen game for Xbox Series X/S","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782851","date":1627282900000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-14-980x551.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          \"Discovery\" flights, a brand-new <em>MSFS</em> feature in its console version, begin in mid-air in scenic locales with pre-populated weather and lighting settings. All of them are a visual treat.

I have long loved that approach. <em>Pilotwings</em> games err on the side of minimal challenge and maximum relaxation, arguably to let players calmly absorb the newest 3D-rendering tricks of each era.</p>\n<p>I think about that strategy now because <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> is launching on Xbox Series X/S this week. Since it's roughly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/xbox-series-x-s-review-beautiful-powerful-but-whatcha-gonna-play/\" target=\"_blank\">eight months out from those consoles' launches</a>, it doesn't count as a \"launch\" game. But <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> is honestly the first true \"next-gen\" first-party console game in Xbox's latest era. Part of that next-gen quality is because this game, unlike other first-party fare, has no \"backwards compatibility\" path to the older Xbox One family.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782851#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1782851&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"87f4f52cfd90c144996eb32c7b517a27749374caa2a727e96141bb60f30465f0","category":"Tech"}
