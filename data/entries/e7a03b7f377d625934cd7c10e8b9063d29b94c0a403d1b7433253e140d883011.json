Michael Sudeau, the owner of <a href=\"https://www.via-atelier.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">VIA Atelier</a>, said that it felt like this was the first time local community members have been able to race in central London since the Red Hook Crits and London Nocturne crits folded in 2017 and 2018.</p>\n<p>Last year’s one-day event, Sudeau said, was a test for the full weekend of racing and activations from brands like Albion, Van Rysel, and others, a cycle-football pitch, and an opportunity to test ride bikes from Outspoken Cycles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-34.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-34.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-34.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The course was a one kilometer loop starting from the two-tiered Coal Drops Yard, where seasoned cycling fans, employees of the bordering shops, and casual shoppers shook cowbells and cheered from the barriers and from above.</p>\n<p>After the start, riders hit a short rise and a hairpin curve before a 200m sprint passing the VIA Atelier storefront.

Costumes were encouraged, and riders took to the start line in style.</p>\n<p>One such competitor was giving out Mcvities Gold candy bars while gathering petition signatures for Brompton to release a gold-painted bike.

David Row, the Head of Communications for Brompton, said, “When BWC started, it was just a group of people connected by this small bike and wanting to meet up, talk about the bikes and then see what they could do on them.”</p>\n<p>The race is at the heart of the festival, Row said, but the event gives the opportunity to bring the community together to meet other Brompton riders from around the world.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-3.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-3.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>“On a personal level, you know, I got goosebumps and a buzz just seeing everyone, everyone from every kind of Brompton community here in London,” said Row.</p>\n<p>Victoria Danneels had traveled from Belgium to attend the event, where she owns a <a href=\"https://www.steil.gent/\" target=\"_blank\">bike shop in Ghent</a>. “A Brompton shop, of course,” she added.

Spectators slapped the barriers and screamed like it was the Tour de France and Coal Drops Yard was the Champs-Élysées.</p>\n<p>Van Rysel had given out free cowbells and they were in wide use across the course. Spectators from the cycling and non-cycling community stopped to cheer on the riders, and slapped the barriers every time the riders rolled through Coal Drops Yard.</p>\n<p>50 men took 10 laps around the course followed by about 30 women for only one lap of the course, each pedaling for glory and a new Brompton T Line, rather than a rainbow jersey.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-17.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-17.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-17.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The disparity between the men’s and women’s finals was clear. “It was over in a hurry,” said Vanessa Urschel after the final, noting that the women had paid the same entry fee as the men, and should therefore race the same number of laps.</p>\n<p>“With the LeMans, you’re running out, you’re trying to get your fold out and navigate one another, so once you get your momentum going, you’re already done,” said Urschel, who had traveled from Leeds for the event, “I really enjoyed myself, but I would’ve loved for there to be parity in the race format.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-20.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-20.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-20.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-28.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-28.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-28.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Row noted the discrepancy and said, “It’s the first time we’ve done it in 5 years, so there’s a lot we’ve learned from it this year.”</p>\n<p>Joanna Dobinson, a mountain bike skills coach, said she thought the mistake was unintentional. Dobinson was, as she put it, “Thankful that we had it, it was an awesome event, but we need more laps next year.

Raeburn, whose Albion team was offering free clothing repairs, said this festival was a rare opportunity to test product in the real world and see common failures that they can design better.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-5.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-5.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/2024_London_Cycling_Festival-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>As the sun splashed streaks of golden light onto the circuit Saturday evening, Brompton riders milled around the course, chatting and watching the crit racing, staying in costume as long as they could. Crit racers laughed and hugged post race and reveled in a rare opportunity for friends and family to see them compete close to home. For a few hours, it felt like King’s Cross was the center of the cycling world.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/london-cycling-festival-2024/\">London Cycling Festival 2024: Brompton World Championships and VIA Criterium</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e7a03b7f377d625934cd7c10e8b9063d29b94c0a403d1b7433253e140d883011","category":"Cycling"}
