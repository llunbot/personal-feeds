{"title":"Strade Bianche 2025 men’s contenders: Who will conquer the white roads of Tuscany?","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/strade-bianche-2025-mens-contenders-who-will-conquer-the-white-roads-of-tuscany","date":1741102363000,"content":"\n      <p><span>For some fans </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/strade-bianche-everything-you-need-to-know?srsltid=AfmBOorLjptgusxQ-549KCMT0SyNjTtNZvWLORKcjAwFBh5eIQh-GDVU\"><span>Strade Bianche</span></a><span> is cycling’s unofficial sixth Monument. It was only given UCI WorldTour status in 2017 but it has quickly become one of the most popular and competitive races on the calendar. The race passes through the hilly region of Tuscany in northern Italy, taking in 15 sections on the dirt roads or </span><span>Strade Bianche </span><span>(“White Roads”). </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Over the years, the race has seen Classics riders mix it with Grand Tour GC riders and occasionally an outsider has come away with a win. For a relatively young race, Strade Bianche has had some exceptional winners, including Tadej Pogačar, Mathieu van der Poel, Wout van Aert, Julian Alaphilippe, Tom Pidcock and Fabian Cancellara.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>The dirt roads mean that punctures, mechanicals and crashes are more likely. Plenty of splits can form in the groups, meaning support vehicles can take a while to get to their riders should they need help. The course tests riders' tactics, bike handling, fitness, and – to a large extent – luck. Despite the variables, often the strongest rider on the day wins Strade Bianche. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>The race can be won in several ways, which makes it an intriguing spectacle for fans. Last year, Pogačar blew his rivals away in a long range attack on a gravel section 80km from the finish. In 2021, Van der Poel blasted away from Alaphilippe and Egan Bernal up the steep Via Santa Caterina climb to the finish at the Piazza del Campo.</span><b><br /></b></p>\n<h3><span>Tadej Pogačar</span></h3>\n<p><span>The reigning champion is once again the overwhelming favourite this year. Pogačar is a contender for pretty much every race he starts, and for good reason. The Slovenian’s historically successful 2024, in which he won the Giro d’Italia, Tour de France, and World Championships, started with early season wins including at Strade Bianche. Worryingly for his rivals, the course in Tuscany is perfectly suited to his attributes. There are several sharp climbs that can act as launch pads for a long range attack, which is how he won last year. Even if he reaches the final climb into Siena with a group, he will be confident that he can rely on his sprint. His UAE Team Emirates - XRG team is also one of the strongest at the race. </span><b></b></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Tadej Pogačar at Strade Bianche 2024\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/13pogacar_sector_tolfe01__strade_bianche_2024_f81c0ee5-1943-4231-bda3-93629d0cfe4c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741101712\" /></div>\n<h3><span>Tom Pidcock</span></h3>\n<p><span>Another former winner of Strade Bianche is Tom Pidcock. The Brit moved from Ineos Grenadiers to Q36.5 Pro Cycling and has enjoyed a successful start to 2025. So far this season, he has won two stages and the overall at the Alula Tour, and a stage win at the Vuelta a Andalucia. Pidcock won on the white roads of Tuscany in 2023 and will be hoping to repeat the feat on Saturday. As a lighter rider, he is more suited to the hilly Classics and his cyclocross background will give him an edge on the gravel roads. If Pidcock is to win again, he will need to be canny as he is unlikely to have Q36.5 Pro Cycling teammates deep into the race, compared to his rivals who ride for WorldTour teams.</span><b></b></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Tom Pidcock at Strade Bianche\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/18pidcock_santa_carolina__strade_bianche_2024_4033e694-5225-47f0-b667-75a33034b212_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741099590\" /></div>\n<h3>\n<span>Ben Healy</span><span></span>\n</h3>\n<p><span>24-year-old Ben Healy of EF Education First-EasyPost has tasted success in Italy in the past with a stage win at the Giro d’Italia in 2023. The undulating course should favour the Irish rider, who kicked off his 2025 season last weekend at the Faun Drôme Classic and Faun-Ardèche Classic. Healy was 12th last year at Strade Bianche in his second participation, after he did not finish his debut ride in 2022. Teammates Richard Carapaz and Rui Costa will be expected to provide valuable support deep into the race too.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Marc Hirschi</span></h3>\n<p><span>Over the winter, Hirschi transferred away from UAE Team Emirates and its plethora of superdomestiques. But the move is going to offer the punchy Swiss rider more opportunities to ride for himself. He is now riding for Tudor Pro Cycling Team, a ProTour team. Like Pidcock, he may suffer from lack of team support. However, the two-time Tour de France stage winner is a prolific winner and has a sharp race sense. He has a strong kick, especially on hilly terrain and will be hoping to use this to his advantage in a race that has often rewarded canny racing. The Swiss rider has had a number of top 10 performances so far this season, including a win at the Clàssica Comunitat Valenciana. </span><b></b></p>\n<h3><span>Other contenders</span></h3>\n<p><span>Team Visma - Lease a Bike are sending a strong Classics team to Strade Bianche but will be without their main leader, <strong>Wout van Aert</strong>.</span><span> <strong>Ben Tulett</strong></span><span>, who joined the team in 2024,</span><span> </span><span>could spring a surprise after an impressive third place finish at Faun Drôme Classic in which he beat Marc Hirschi in a sprint. Another man who could cause an upset is </span><strong>Kévin Vauquelin</strong><span> of Arkéa - B&amp;B Hotels, who has been racing well on the early season French circuit. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Two-time winner </span><span><strong>Michał Kwiatkowski</strong> </span><span>of Ineos Grenadiers will be hoping to roll back the years and win in Siena again for a hattrick. </span><span><strong>Matej Mohorič</strong> </span><span>of Bahrain - Victorious would normally be considered to be in contention but he has not shown his usual form so far in 2025. Despite this, he should be ruled out. </span><strong>Tim Wellens</strong><span> of UAE Team Emirates - XRG will be riding in service of Pogačar, but should his leader have any issues, the Belgian could ride for a result himself.  </span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>Pello Bilbao</strong><span> of Bahrain - Victorious will be hoping to convert recent strong GC performances into the one-day race on Saturday. He will arrive at Strade Bianche on the back of two GC podiums at the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana and the UAE Tour in February. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"64ead5daa6b115380fd2b4c38b2d5f57274d0094f6b34debad747592f11f773f","category":"Cycling"}
