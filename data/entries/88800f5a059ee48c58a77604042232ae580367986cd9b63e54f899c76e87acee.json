Anquetil, Merckx, Hinault and Indurain all won five Tours on steel bikes (despite what many people say, Indurain <em>did</em> ride a steel Banesto at the 1995 Tour; <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pinarello-s-classic-bikes-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Fausto Pinarello showed me the bike</a>). Steel is mythical in the way the Aston Martin DB5 is mythical, not because it is the best-performing car but because it starred in the greatest moments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So knowing this, when I look at a steel bike my collective fetish kicks in as I discuss the artisanal integrity of the brazing and the way the 97-year-old framebuilder came to steel bikes through making armaments in the Second World War. I start to weep as I say this, gazing at the steel bike in question; my heart literally aneurysms at the sight of the seat lug.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03-1140x1708.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/04000859/steel_bikes_ritchey_road_logic_03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-imitates-art-the-embacher-collection\" target=\"_blank\">once interviewed</a> Austrian architect and prolific bicycle collector Michael Embacher and asked him why he chose to buy the bikes he did. ‘Because they have atmosphere,’ he replied. Bikes, for non-racers at least, are emotional objects first and foremost, and steel bikes are emotional objects for me. However, this isn’t a sound scientific argument, and I appreciate Matthew’s point that steel is an inferior material, mechanically speaking, to carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Columbus Omnicrom, the steel alloy used in Columbus’s top-end tubesets, and compare it with Toray T800H, a carbon fibre commonly used in composite frames. The ultimate tensile strength of Omnicrom is 1,300MPa while the UTS of Toray T800H is 5,490MPa. Then density: steel is around 8g/cm<sup>3</sup> while carbon is more like 1.5g/cm<sup>3</sup>. So carbon is four times stronger than steel while being five times less dense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fact propelled designers towards ever-greater stiffness values – the bottom bracket stiffness of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cervelo-r5-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">Cervélo R5</a> is a claimed 221N/mm, a steel Cinelli Vigorelli is 117N/mm (source: <a href=\"https://www.bike-x.de/\" target=\"_blank\">bike-x.de</a>). However, this isn’t because steel isn’t strong or stiff enough as a material – after all, they build bridges out of it – it’s just that in bike terms, stiffness is largely dictated by tube diameter, and tube diameter largely dictates weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wall thickness and material type being equal, a 40mm diameter tube is eight times stiffer than a 20mm diameter tube, and twice as heavy. Carbon alleviated that ‘twice as heavy’ bit, while steel builders long since arrived at a point where tubes could only be so wide before frame weight became unacceptable (about 1.6kg for a race bike, the industry seems to say).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That sounds damning but, honestly, it’s the reverse, because it means steel frames are only ever <em>so</em> stiff, and <em>that</em> is steel’s magic. It is not that steel is inherently flexible as a material, but rather steel frames are more flexible than carbon due to their de facto skinnier tubes. Skinny tubes give steel frames a special, almost unique character – certainly one not found in carbon. And I’m not talking comfort necessarily, I’m talking liveliness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A steel bike has a lively spring that most carbon is devoid of – trust me, you can feel it (and if you wonder, consider those BB stiffness values). That ride feel is markedly different to a carbon bike’s and I find it highly endearing, to the point where it more than compensates for extra weight or lack of aero efficiencies (although light steel builds are very possible with the right parts, so too fast ones with aero wheels and bars – plus it’s interesting to note an aero frame, anecdotally, is worth about 5 watts, aero wheels 10 watts, and a rider is 75% of overall drag).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What the heart wants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I love steel. It is different, and different in a good way <em>because</em> of its limitations. Could the same be achieved in carbon? You betcha, and when it is you get best-in-the-world bikes such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/argonaut-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Argonaut Road Bike</a> (made from deliberately slender tubes). But most carbon bike manufacturers don’t seem interested. They want their bikes to win the Tour – fair enough – but I want my bikes to make me smile, whether I’m looking at them, dreaming of them or simply riding them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon has a place too, but steel will always feel that bit more magic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>James’s first ever bike was steel, which is probably why he loves it so much. It was a red Raleigh with cream-wall tyres and stablisers, which he took off himself, shortly before he fell off</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/steel-bikes-opinion\">Opinion: In defence of steel bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"88800f5a059ee48c58a77604042232ae580367986cd9b63e54f899c76e87acee","category":"Cycling"}
