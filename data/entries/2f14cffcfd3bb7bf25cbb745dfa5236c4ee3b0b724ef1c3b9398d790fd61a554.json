The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nNothing is known about iOS 17.5.2, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21F101. However, the update will almost certainly be a minor one, especially given that Apple is now focused on iOS 18 beta testing. iPhone users still running iOS 17 can expect the update to include bug fixes and/or security patches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear when iOS 17.5.2 will be released to the public, but updates revealed by this leaker typically become available within a few weeks after they post on social media, so it will likely be released at some point in July.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.5.2 will come out ahead of iOS 17.6 and iOS 18, which both remain in beta testing. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/apple-seeds-ios-17-6-beta-2-to-developers/\">second beta of iOS 17.6</a> was released to developers and public beta testers last week, while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/\">third beta of iOS 18</a> was seeded to developers earlier today. So far, no major changes have been discovered in iOS 17.6.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-preparing-ios-17-5-2/\">Apple Preparing Minor iOS 17.5.2 Update for iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-minor-ios-17-5-2-update-for-iphone.2430930/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2f14cffcfd3bb7bf25cbb745dfa5236c4ee3b0b724ef1c3b9398d790fd61a554","category":"Apple"}
