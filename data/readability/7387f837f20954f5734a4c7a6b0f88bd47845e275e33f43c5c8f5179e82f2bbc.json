Ganna currently holds the record with a time of 4:01.934.</p><p>“We have been steadily lowering the 4 km pursuit World Record over the last few years, making the sub-4 minute barrier less of a dream and, I believe, more of an inevitability,” Lambie said in an Instagram post.</p><p>The attempt is inspired by the four-minute mile barrier broken by Roger Bannister in 1954 and won’t take place at a traditional track event. Lambie will approach the attempt more like an hour record, selecting his location, equipment, and timing to make for the fastest possible time. The attempt will take place in the velodrome in Aguascalientes, Mexico.</p><p>“I’m partnering with some of the best engineers, designers, and coaches in the world in hopes of breaking through the 4:00 barrier,” Lambie wrote.</p></div></div>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"7387f837f20954f5734a4c7a6b0f88bd47845e275e33f43c5c8f5179e82f2bbc","category":"Cycling"}
