Rickey’s Gonna Give You That Chance.’","link":"https://joeblogs.joeposnanski.com/p/being-rickey","date":1734892348000,"content":"\n<p>Another great Rickey Henderson remembrance, this one from Joe Posnanski:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’d argue that no player in baseball history was ever more <em>alive</em>\nthan Rickey Henderson, which is why his shocking death just days\nbefore his 66th Christmas hits so hard. Rickey played a cautious\nsport with abandon. Rickey played a timid sport with flash. Rickey\nirritated and thrilled and frustrated and dominated and left us\nall wanting more.</p>\n\n<p>“When we were kids,” his teammate Mike Gallego said, “we played in\nthe backyard emulating Pete Rose’s stance or Joe Morgan’s. I\nbelieve Rickey emulated Rickey.”</p>\n\n<p>Yes, Rickey was his own thing, entirely, completely, from the way\nhe crouched at the plate (“he has a strike zone the size of\nHitler’s heart,” Jim Murray famously wrote), to the way he slid\nheadfirst on the bases (he modeled his slide after an airplane\nlanding) to the way he held out virtually every spring (“You have\nto say Rickey’s consistent,” Don Mattingly said during one of\nthose holdouts, “and that’s what you want from a ballplayer:\nconsistency”) to the way he referred to himself in the third\nperson (“People are always saying, ‘Rickey says Rickey,’” Rickey\nsaid, “but it’s been blown way out of proportion”) to the joyful\nconfidence he exuded every time he stepped out on the diamond from\nage 20 to age 44.</p>\n\n<p>“You wanna throw me out today?” he would ask catchers the first\ntime he stepped to the plate. “Well, hang tight. Rickey’s gonna\ngive you that chance.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t want to spoil a single word of the story Posnanski closes his piece with. Just be sure to read through to the very end.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/43090305/rickey-henderson-greatest-all-dies-65\">From ESPN’s obit, by Howard Bryant and Jeff Passan</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He played his last game at 44 years, 268 days old Sept. 19, 2003,\nfor the Dodgers, and his stolen base total remains more than 1,000\nahead of the current active leader.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s the list of <a href=\"https://www.statmuse.com/mlb/ask/most-career-stolen-bases-among-active-players\">career steals leaders among active players</a>, led by Slarling Marte with 354 and Jose Altuve  with 315. There are only four other active players with more than 200. Rickey had 1,406. Lou Brock is second place on the all-time list with 938 steals. So even if Marte (who is already 36 years old) or Altuve (34 years old) were to steal as many <em>additional</em> bases as Lou Brock did in his entire 19-year career — the guy who is second-place all-time — they’d still be well short of Rickey’s record. In the entire history of Major League Baseball there are only nine players who stole <em>half</em> of Rickey’s career number. But as FanGraphs’s <a href=\"https://x.com/DSzymborski/status/1870568577696178302\">Dan Szymborski observes</a>, “The funny thing with Rickey is that you take away the stolen bases, he’s <em>still</em> easily in the top 10 for LF WAR all time.”</p>\n\n<p>Also from ESPN:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Stories about Henderson were as legendary as his play, such as the\ntrue story of him once framing a million-dollar bonus check and\nhanging it on his wall — without first cashing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last but not least, give a listen to <a href=\"https://x.com/KNBR/status/1557037105909358594\">this quick story from Giants great Will Clark</a>, about a preseason game against Rickey’s Oakland A’s when the A’s coaches tried to give him the “don’t steal” sign. You <em>know</em> what Rickey did.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/22/rickeys-gonna-give-you-that-chance\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"32561ff1aefffcf18fee9942aa0bbe8cdfaf7ca3b78b80808918a7ad160e1f58","category":"Tech"}
