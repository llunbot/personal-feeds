Thirty years later, Cane Creek is still going strong and producing some of the most innovative and lust-worthy products on the market. To celebrate its 30th anniversary, Cane Creek is opening a new Experience Center and launching a limited run of special edition Anniversary Collection components.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center.webp\" alt=\"Inside the new Cane Creek Experience center with new products for sale and a look at the brand's product over time.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The new Experience is part museum, retail space, lounge, and coffee shop.

Located in the Cane Creek Factory just north of Asheville in Fletcher, North Carolina, visitors can get immersed in the evolution of the brand’s products, connect with other riders, take a test ride, or pick up a fresh set of eeWings — you know you want some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cane Creek says that, “Central to the space is a curated exhibit documenting the history of Cane Creek innovations, with examples of every major Cane Creek product over the years.” You can see the progression from the first Cane Creek-branded product, the Air-Driver mountain bike shock (AD-4 &amp; AD-8), to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cane-creek-tigon-air-coil-rear-shock-mtb/\">super advanced Tigon</a> shock of today. Beyond that, you can sip some coffee, pick out colorful components for your next custom build, or even take a deep dive into the creation of the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cane-creek-invert-review/\">Invert Gravel Fork</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes.webp\" alt=\"A display wall in the Cane Creek Experience Center with custom bikes and merchandise.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cane-Creek-Experience-Center-bikes-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>In the Experience Center, you can drool over some custom builds or pick up some Cane Creek merch.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Cane Creek’s website, the doors to the Experience Center are already open while they put the finishing touches on the space. An official grand opening party is scheduled for June 14th, which is open to the public. If you’re in the area, you can swing by and check it out Monday-Friday, 9 am to 5 pm, at 355 Cane Creek Rd. Fletcher, NC, 28732, USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re planning to head to the Experience Center, you can make a day of it and take a factory tour if you plan ahead and schedule one online. Other factory experiences include free Invert Gravel Fork test rides as well as suspension Test and Tune sessions (for an additional fee), both of which need to be scheduled in advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_01.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_01-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Anniversary Collection version of the eeBrakes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_01-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_01-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_01-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_01-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_01.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Special Edition eeBrakes</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_15.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_15-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"The Anniversary Collection version of the Invert Gravel Fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_15-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_15-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_15-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_15-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CaneCreek30th_KepcharLLC_15.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Gloss blue looks pretty eye-catching on the Invert.</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cane Creek’s 30th Anniversary Collection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a brand aficionado or just a fan of Cane Creek Blue, then the 30th Anniversary Collection will be worth your attention.
