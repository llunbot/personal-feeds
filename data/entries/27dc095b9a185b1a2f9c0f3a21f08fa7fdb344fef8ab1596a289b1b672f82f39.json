The most important features and highlights of REVIVE 3.0 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New saddle clamps for a 5mm lower stack height</li>\n<li>A new 360° rotatable foot unit shortens the overall length of the seat post by further 10 mm</li>\n<li>New slide-on cable barrel for easier installation</li>\n<li>New BikeYoke cables (3mm housing + 0.9mm polished and coated stainless wire)</li>\n<li>Travel reduction in 5mm increments (4x5mm spacer included)</li>\n<li>3D-forged, one-piece upper tube for increased stiffness and strength</li>\n<li>Redesigned actuation linkage for imprived feel and feedback</li>\n<li>Two-piece saddle bolts with integrated conical washers for easier saddle mounting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Revive 3.0 is available in four different lengths, all of which allowing for infinitely adjustable drop. Its extremely short stack height helps to maximize the drop on your bike. The low overall weight and the unrivaled smoothness, even under cold temperatures, should also be highlighted.</p>\n<p><em>If you are right in between two sizes, you may opt for the longer one, as the drop, and thus the overall length of the post can be reduced using 5mm spacers. This allows you to get the most of the available drop without the need to opt for a shorter version.</em></p>\n<p>Check out sizing and availability at <a href=\"https://bikeyoke.com/en/revive-3.0-silver-ltd./revt-ltd\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Yoke</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-yoke-revive-3-limited-silver/\">Bike Yoke Revive 3 Dropper and a Special Limited Edition in Silver</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"27dc095b9a185b1a2f9c0f3a21f08fa7fdb344fef8ab1596a289b1b672f82f39","category":"Cycling"}
