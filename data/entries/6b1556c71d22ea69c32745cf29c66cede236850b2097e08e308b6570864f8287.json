Picking randomly through such a game list is like wandering through a foreign country, searching for hidden jewels among all the shovelware in the bewildering and wildly imaginative early video game history.\n<p><em>UFO 50</em> captures that feeling perfectly, combining the freewheeling inventiveness of old-school game design with modern refinements and more consistent baseline quality bred over the ensuing decades. The result is an extremely playable love letter to the gaming history that will charm even the most jaded retro game fan.</p>\n<h2>A loving homage</h2>\n<p><em>UFO 50</em> presents itself as a collection of 50 dusty game cartridges made by UFO Soft, a fictional developer that operated from 1982 to 1989. Working through the company's catalog, you'll see evolution in graphics, music, and gameplay design that mirror the ever-changing gaming market of the real-world '80s. You'll also see the same characters, motifs, and credited \"developers\" appearing over and over again, building a convincing world behind the games themselves.</p>\n<p>The individual games in <em>UFO 50</em> definitely wear their influences on their sleeves, with countless, almost overt homages to specific '80s arcade and console games. But there isn't a single title here that I'd consider a simple clone or knock-off of an old gaming concept; each sub-game brings its own twist or novel idea that makes it feel new.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049997#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049997&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b1556c71d22ea69c32745cf29c66cede236850b2097e08e308b6570864f8287","category":"Tech"}
