The rear triangle skips any extra pivots, relying on flattened seatstays to flex a bit, keeping it tight and light.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4.jpg\" alt=\"decathlon rockrider 900s carbon full suspension mountain bike shown from rear angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4-297x215.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4-800x580.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4-120x87.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4-768x557.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-4-1536x1114.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The spec is different than <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/brilliant-but-still-prototype-rockrider-enduro-xc-race-bikes-could-be-at-decathlon-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">what their sponsored racers are using</a>, but there are a couple items that carry over. The 120mm travel frame is the same and has a claimed 1,980g weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll share the Hutchinson Kraken Racing Lab 29×2.3 tires, although their riders might be <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prototypes-spotted-from-hutchinson-bontaz-ext-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">rolling on lighter prototypes</a> at any given event. Interestingly, they spec a reinforced Hardskin model on the back of the bike, with a 100g lighter, more supple standard tire on the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2.jpg\" alt=\"drivetrain closeup of decathlon rockrider 900s carbon full suspension mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And you’ll get SRAM AXS, too, but down-spec’d to GX AXS with Truvativ Stylo 6K alloy cranks. They spec 170mm cranks on S/M and 175mm on L/XL frames. Brakes are SRAM Level T with 180/160mm rotors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"head tube closeup of decathlon rockrider 900s carbon full suspension mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-3-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The suspension, wheels, and cockpit are all different. Stock bikes come with a Rockshox Reba RL 120mm fork and SIDluxe Select+ rear shock. Both are controlled by a Twist Lock remote lockout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheels are Reynolds TR309/289 XC combo. They’re carbon and hookless with a 30mm internal width for the front, and 28mm on the rear. It’s another interesting mix of spec from front to rear, with the likely goal being increased traction up front and a slightly lighter, faster wheel on the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1.jpg\" alt=\"fork and head tube closeup of decathlon rockrider 900s carbon full suspension mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/decathlon-rockrider-race-900s-full-susp-xc-mtb-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with a house-brand alloy bar and stem and a carbon seatpost. The Fizik Argo Vento saddles are shorter 350mm lengths on S/M bikes, and longer 400mm sizes on L/XL. It’s routed for stealth dropper seatposts, but you’ll have to add your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complete bike weights are listed as 25.8-26.5lbs without pedals but with inner tubes. Go tubeless and you’ll drop about 200g off each bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available now, even in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.decathlon.com/products/rockrider-race-900s-gx-eagle-xc-mountain-bike-350357?adept-product=rockrider-race-900s-gx-eagle-xc-mountain-bike-350357&amp;adept_product_id=rockrider-race-900s-gx-eagle-xc-mountain-bike-350357&amp;source=search#product-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/decathlons-rockrider-race-900s-full-suss-xc-bike-now-on-sale/\">Decathlon’s Rockrider RACE 900S Full-Suss XC Bike now on sale</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0ff406080beb3dc95f844babdf2debe6c64cefe4269bfb3e1f4b8d1a003e1aba","category":"Cycling"}
