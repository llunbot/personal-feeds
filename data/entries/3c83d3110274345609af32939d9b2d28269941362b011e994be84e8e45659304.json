The higher prices will generally take effect late this year or next year, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Inc. is one of TSMC’s largest customers and its iPhones use advanced microprocessors made in TSMC foundries. It couldn’t be determined how much more Apple would pay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not just iPhones: TSMC manufactures all “Apple silicon”. And no one else can make them.</p>\n\n<p>Really, this is just Econ 101: demand for TSMC chips is high, supply is constrained, so prices are going up.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/29/tsmc-prices\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3c83d3110274345609af32939d9b2d28269941362b011e994be84e8e45659304","category":"Tech"}
