Riders strip their bikes to the bare bones to shed weight, doing anything they can to make the upwards slog easier. Standing near the start line then, some might be humbled to see Geoff Pickin take his place in the starting pen, atop his 13.5kg handcycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pickin is one of the only handcyclists to compete in the British hill climb scene, and the only one at the National Hill Climb Championships to tackle the infamous ‘Struggle’, which pitches up to 22% gradient. We caught up with him ahead of his run to find out all about para-hill climbing and his experience.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/?post_type=tablepress_table&amp;p=136942\">Sub-5kg Cannondale SuperSix Evo: National Hill Climb Championship 2023 gallery</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/national-hill-climb-championship-2023-tech-gallery\">Super glue, sawn-offs and the dodgiest bodges: National Hill Climb Championship 2023 gallery</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/focus-izalco-max-national-hill-climb-championships-2023\">This Focus Izalco Max with dual power meter pedals and a front derailleur weighs just 5.2kg</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-warren-bike-national-hill-climb-2023\">1×11 Campagnolo Record and half a handlebar: Simon Warren’s Time NX</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Geoff Pickin hill climb handcycle 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin8-2.jpg 2005w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Pickin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How did you get into handcycling?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I had an accident at work in 1991 but handcycles didn’t come onto the scene until around 1998. They were quite crude then and used to be attached to wheelchairs. I’ve been involved since the beginning and watched the bikes evolve into what they are today, which is more complex and heavier but obviously better designed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Geoff Pickin handcycle hill climb nationals 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin_hillclimb.jpg 1000w\" /><figcaption>Andy Jones Photography</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hill climbs are notoriously gruelling work, even on a traditional bike. What made you want to tackle hills on a handcycle?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought Simon Warren’s <em>100 Greatest Cycling Climbs</em> book and began to tick them off one by one. Then, in 2021, I read about the National Hill Climb Championships and decided that I wanted to be the first para-handcyclist to enter, which I did last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d cycled a bit as a teenager but never competed in any races. I just wanted to give it a go. Why hills? I just like a challenge, the steeper the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It’s a hefty machine to get up a steep gradient. How do you prepare ahead of the races?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a lot slower than the other riders, so I set myself a time that I’d like to achieve and compete against myself. If I can beat that time, then it’s a win in my books.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Geoff Pickin hill climb handcycle 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin9-2.jpg 2016w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Pickin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>You’ve done lots of other hill climbs this year. How does ‘The Struggle’ compare?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s going to be tough. Anything over 15% gradient and I start to struggle because of the gearing. Plus all the weight is on the back so I tend to find keeping traction difficult as well. I’ve never tipped but the wheels do spin out from time to time. I’ve let some pressure out of the tyres, as I usually run around 90 PSI, which should help a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Geoff Pickin hill climb handcycle 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/geoff_pickin3-2.jpg 2016w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Pickin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Speaking of the bike, it’s an impressive contraption. How did you come by it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Handcycles aren’t that common so I had to import it. I bought this bike from Top End Wheelchairs, which is based in America. There are different frame widths, as well as cranks lengths etc, but aside from that it comes as a standard build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to a traditional bike, the wheels are smaller – these are 650c – and I’ve got an old-school triple chainset on it but, apart from that, it’s essentially just upside down. It’s also a lot heavier obviously. This weighs around 13.5kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>As you said, handcycling isn’t that common in the UK. How did you find it, turning up to races as a para-rider?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started, it was a bit of a shock to the system for the organisers. But over the past year, especially with the Cycling Time Trial association, it’s become more accessible for disabled people, which is a good thing. The issue is that I’m one of the few people that does this sort of thing but you become known and people now look forward to seeing the handcycle and there isn’t too much trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Geoff Pickin hill climb handcycle 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/untitled-40-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What would you say to anyone thinking about trying handcycling?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d say just give it a go and push yourself, that’s it. It doesn’t matter if you come last, it’s just about having a good time. I enjoy meeting people and being part of the competition, and that’s the best part about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pickin completed the climb in 50 minutes 24 seconds, bang on his 50 minute target set prior to the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Keen for more hill climb content?
