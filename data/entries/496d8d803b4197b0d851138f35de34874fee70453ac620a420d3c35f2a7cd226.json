Perfect for bicycle touring in shoulder seasons or riding in winter months. Ibex’ clothing is bombproof, designed to look great off the bike, at a bar, or cafe, while keeping you warm and protected from temperature fluctuations.  This garment is classified as a Midlayer piece, with 19.5 micron wool, and 300 gm2 weight. The full-zip front allows for venting and the zippered pockets will keep your goods safe-n-secure.
