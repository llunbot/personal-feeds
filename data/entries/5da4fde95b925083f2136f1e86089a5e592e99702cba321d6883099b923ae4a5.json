But right now <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLCWFNM/\">you can get one at Amazon for just $279</a>, $70 off the MSRP, and the second-best price we’ve ever seen following a short-lived dip to $250 in certain colors for Black Friday. As we write this, only yellow and silver are available, but colors continue to pop up, so if you want purple or blue, keep checking. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLBNNRT\">256GB model is also on sale for $429</a> with the same $70 savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an A14 Bionic chip, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">this tablet is ready</a> to help you tackle games, streaming, and even some of your workload since you can easily use it with a Magic Keyboard. This 10.9-inch tablet features a Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and deep contrasts for a great visual experience. You’ll also get excellent battery life and years of upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For FaceTime calls, this iPad features a 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage, keeping the focus on you even if you move around. There’s also a 12MP Wide back camera if you want to snap some pics or videos. The only thing it doesn’t have is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>, but with a slow roll-out, you’re not going to be missing out on too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and add the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/?th=1\">10th-gen iPad to your cart for just $279</a> because once they’re gone we don’t know if this deal will ever return.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLCWFNM/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5da4fde95b925083f2136f1e86089a5e592e99702cba321d6883099b923ae4a5","category":"Apple"}
