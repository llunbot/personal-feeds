I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the drug store, but that's just peanuts to space.”\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/45PpoxU\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Starfield </i></a>may as well put this quote on the cover page of its design document. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/bethesdas-starfield-direct-shows-off-a-massive-galactic-scale-space-rpg/\">deafening prerelease hype for the game</a> emphasizes its inclusion of “over 1,000 planets,” across hundreds of realistically rendered star systems throughout the galaxy. That promotion has also focused on just how much <i>stuff</i> there is to do across those myriad planets; Bethesda Head of Publishing Pete Hines <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/v_LCiIY0gLQ?feature=share&amp;t=4033\">said in a recent interview with IGN</a> that he’s spent 150–160 hours in the game and “hasn’t even come close” to seeing everything.</p>\n<p>After a few dozen hours with a prerelease version of <i>Starfield</i>, I’m comfortable saying that Hines isn’t being hyperbolic. One look at the game’s intricate star map and the myriad star systems you can reach with a series of warp-speed jumps is enough to give you vertigo.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230830170717_1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Just a small corner of &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;'s massive star map.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230830170717_1-640x360.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230830170717_1-1280x720.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230830170717_1.jpg\">Just a small corner of <em>Starfield</em>'s massive star map.</a> </p></div>\n<p>If you can focus on <i>Starfield</i>’s “core story” questline, which focuses on a collection of mysterious, vision-granting Artifacts strewn across the galaxy, you may well be able to reach the “ending” of the game in a reasonable amount of time. If you’re anything like me, though, you’ll find yourself quickly sidetracked by a cornucopia of optional missions that start to grow almost fractally, with each new quest flowing into offers of multiple further quests along the way.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964514#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964514&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2af0fdd13b4dcc198984d9a53687236ab640f2bf369f872151627d4a3217875d","category":"Tech"}
