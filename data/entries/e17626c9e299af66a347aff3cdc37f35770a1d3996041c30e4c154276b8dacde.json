In 2022 Ford <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/weve-driven-fords-other-electric-workhorse-the-2022-e-transit/\">debuted the E-Transit</a>, which has been <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/725448/ford-us-ev-sales-june2024/\">steadily growing in sales</a> over the past few quarters. Now the Blue Oval has started deliveries of the model-year 2024 E-Transit, and there are some worthwhile improvements compared to the MY23 van.</p>\n<p>The opprobrium that is now starting to stick to supersized pickup trucks has mostly ignored the humble van. It's contradictory, on the face of it; even a low-roof Transit takes up more volume on the road than most pickups. But then, there aren't leather-and-chrome special edition Transit vans driven more as commuter cars or weekend toys like there are pickupsâ€”at least for now.</p>\n<p>EV vans ought to be even more immune, for they maintain their working class credentials and burnish them with a side helping of environmentalism. For example, Ford says that data from its telematics show that since its introduction in 2022 until the end of Q2 2024, E-Transit customers in the US and Canada had avoided burning more than 3 million gallons of gas (11.3 million L) and reduced their output of CO<sub>2</sub> by 25 million kg.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047080#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047080&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
