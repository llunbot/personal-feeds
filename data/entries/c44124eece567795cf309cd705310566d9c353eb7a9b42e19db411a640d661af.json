It will only take two to three days of logistics and custom clearance.\"</blockquote>Another supplier told <em>Nikkei</em> it is building new plants in Thailand for Apple, and construction of a new factory for MacBooks and other products will be completed this year. Apple has already been mass producing its Apple Watch in Thailand for more than a year, according to the outlet's sources.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has expanded its supply chain beyond China over the past several years, with some production now occurring at factories in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/26/apple-manufacturing-iphone-14-india/\">India</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/21/airpods-pro-assembled-vietnam/\">Vietnam</a>. Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/11/macbooks-assembled-in-thailand-kuo/\">said</a> that the main production location outside of China for Apple's future MacBooks may be Thailand, as such diversification helps Apple to mitigate geopolitical tensions and avoid risks like U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thailand/\">Thailand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/\">Nikkei</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/apple-talks-make-macbooks-thailand/\">Apple Reportedly in Talks With Suppliers to Assemble MacBooks in Thailand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-in-talks-with-suppliers-to-assemble-macbooks-in-thailand.2386696/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c44124eece567795cf309cd705310566d9c353eb7a9b42e19db411a640d661af","category":"Apple"}
