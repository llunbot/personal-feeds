We were impressed by the cards' performance and power efficiency, even if they still have some of the same caveats as older Radeon cards (lack of DLSS upscaling and lower relative ray-tracing performance being two).</p>\n<p>Today AMD is formally expanding its family of RDNA 4 graphics cards with the Radeon RX 9060 XT, a GPU that will go up against Nvidia's RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti GPUs. These GPUs have just half the compute units of the RX 9070 XT, but at $299 and $349 for 8GB and 16GB configurations, they ought to be decent options for 1080p or entry-level 1440p gaming PCs (with the eternal \"if you can find them\" caveat that comes with buying a GPU in 2025).</p>\n<p>AMD says the new GPUs will be available \"beginning later this year\" from the typical range of partners—AMD released renders of a reference GPU design, but sometimes these are starting points that manufacturers can take or leave, rather than products AMD intends to manufacture and sell itself.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amds-299-radeon-rx-9060-xt-brings-8gb-or-16gb-of-ram-to-fight-the-rtx-5060/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amds-299-radeon-rx-9060-xt-brings-8gb-or-16gb-of-ram-to-fight-the-rtx-5060/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"745741c1bc1c2446ea089b108ec8f855026127ed40f820f27e16c8ff51de6699","category":"Tech"}
