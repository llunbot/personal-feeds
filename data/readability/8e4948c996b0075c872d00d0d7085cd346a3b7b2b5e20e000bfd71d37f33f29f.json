Beyond that, it does appear that the team is collaborating with its partners to potentially further explore opportunities for using the technology.</p><p>“Our relationship with Pinarello has always been grounded in a love of racing and innovation, and their work on the Dogma F Disc should enable our riders to race to their maximum,” said Carsten Jeppesen, the team’s Head of Technical Partners.”</p><p>“Working closely with Pinarello and Shimano, we will continue to develop the all-round disc package, optimizing weight, the integration across Dura-Ace, and improvements in the quick release system.”</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8e4948c996b0075c872d00d0d7085cd346a3b7b2b5e20e000bfd71d37f33f29f","category":"Cycling"}
