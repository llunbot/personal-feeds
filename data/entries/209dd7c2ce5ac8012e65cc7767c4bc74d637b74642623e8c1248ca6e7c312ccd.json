In fact it is Apple’s biggest ever Apple Watch display – bigger even than the Apple Watch Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also Apple’s first wide angle OLED display. This new technology should make the display more power-efficient, thus preserving battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pixels will also emit more light at any angle – which is a benefit since most people view their watches from different angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that the always-on display can update once a second, not once a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More to follow…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re expecting to see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch SE 3rd generation</a>, running <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362011/watchos-11-watch-faces-fitness-vitals-translate.html\">watchOS 11</a>, launch in September 2024 at the company’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Glowtime event</a> (see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">how to watch the September event</a>).
