Apple has been offering monthly replays since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-music-launches-monthly-replay-experience/\">February</a>, but now users can view their stats for the full year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing the Replay website, subscribers can view a customized Highlight Reel featuring animated cards showcasing their top artists, songs, albums, and genres for 2024 so far. Listeners can also discover if they rank among an artist's top fans with percentage-based \"super-fan\" designations, providing insight into how they compare to other listeners globally. The cards are accompanied by background music relevant to each statistical highlight.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Music Replay shows precise timestamps for when users reached significant listening milestones throughout the year. The service also provides year-over-year comparisons, allowing subscribers to see how their music preferences have evolved since 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe highlight reel can be viewed on desktop browsers, but it looks better when visited on mobile devices. Elsewhere, below the reel, are more detailed breakdowns of listening history, including top playlists and stations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor easy access to your most-played tracks, you can add your Apple Music Replay 2024 playlist directly to the Music app. However, unlike Spotify's Wrapped feature, Apple Music Replay remains a web-based experience, with the Music app only able to play the curated playlist of top songs once added through the website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo access your personalized Apple Music Replay 2024 experience and view their music statistics, visit <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/replay\">music.apple.com/replay</a> and sign in with your Apple Account.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-music-replay-2024-experience-now-live/\">Apple Music Replay 2024 Experience Now Live</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-replay-2024-experience-now-live.2444510/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa6e80afef7ffbacf5b8d0cda4994af64b427f614617a8253f16fa9978e865fa","category":"Apple"}
