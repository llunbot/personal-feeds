Kuo cites recent earnings reports from Apple suppliers TSMC and Largan as evidence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Colors.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" />\r<br />\nTSMC recently said that it did not see an increase in unit growth, while Largan said that orders for high-end models in 2024 are similar to last year. Kuo believes that Apple's ‌iPhone 16‌ orders for the second half of 2024 are around 87 million units, which is lower than the 91 million <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> units that Apple ordered in 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said that certain suppliers may have been asked to increase production, but that may be related to \"specific reasons within individual industries or components.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe suggests that expectations that Apple Intelligence will drive ‌iPhone 16‌ sales \"may be too optimistic\" as the feature is available in U.S. English only.\r<br />\n<blockquote>The launch of Apple Intelligence is generally considered to be the reason for the increase in iPhone 16 orders. However, Apple Intelligence will only be available in Beta for US users in 2H24, and Apple Intelligence Siri only supports English. Regardless of whether Apple Intelligence alone can drive replacement demand (which is another big topic), the expectation that consumers will buy the new iPhone 16 for the Beta version of Apple Intelligence in 2H24 may be too optimistic.</blockquote>\r<br />\nEarlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em> suggested that Apple was counting on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> AI features to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/apple-ai-iphone-16-shipment-boost/\">boost iPhone shipments</a> by 10 percent in 2024. Apple Intelligence requires an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or later, so customers with an older <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> will need to upgrade to the ‌iPhone 16‌ to get the technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence includes a long list of new capabilities, including Writing Tools for proofreading, polishing, and summarizing text, Image Playground for generating images, and Genmoji for creating custom emoji. Apple Intelligence will also be used to overhaul <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, but the new ‌Siri‌ functionality isn't slated to launch until 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo far, Apple has not established an AI deal for Chinese consumers, and Apple Intelligence will also not be coming to the European Union when ‌iOS 18‌ launches.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/kuo-no-iphone-16-ai-demand-increase/\">Kuo: Expectation That Apple Intelligence Will Drive iPhone 16 Sales 'May Be Too Optimistic'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-expectation-that-apple-intelligence-will-drive-iphone-16-sales-may-be-too-optimistic.2431677/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"247640d8baf556cf0a2ea9f6b5e410434484230a461527e146b252f6285dd052","category":"Apple"}
