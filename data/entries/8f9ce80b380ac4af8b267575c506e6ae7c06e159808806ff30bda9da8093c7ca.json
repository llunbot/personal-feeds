{"title":"“They curdle like milk”: WB DVDs from 2006–2008 are rotting away in their cases","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/they-curdle-like-milk-wb-dvds-from-2006-2008-are-rotting-away-in-their-cases/","date":1741372784000,"content":"<p>Although digital media has surpassed physical media in popularity, there are still plenty of reasons for movie buffs and TV fans to hold onto, and even continue buying, DVDs. With physical media, owners are assured that they'll always be able to play their favorite titles, so long as they take care of their discs. While digital copies are sometimes abruptly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/funimation-dvds-included-forever-available-digital-copies-forever-ends-april-2/\">ripped away from viewers</a>, physical media owners don't have to worry about a corporation ruining their Friday night movie plans. At least, that's what <em>we thought.</em></p>\n<p>It turns out that if your DVD collection includes titles distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, the home movie distribution arm of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), you may one day open up the box to find a case of DVD rot.</p>\n<p>Recently, Chris Bumbray, editor-in-chief of movie news and reviews site <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/warner-bros-dvds-dont-work/\">JoBlo</a>, detailed what would be a harrowing experience for any film collector. He said he recently tried to play his <em>Passage to Marseille </em>DVD, but “after about an hour, the disc simply stopped working.” He said “the same thing happened” with <em>Across the Pacific</em>. Bumbray bought a new DVD player but still wasn’t able to play his <em>Desperate Journey</em> disc. The latter case was especially alarming because, like a lot of classic films and shows, the title isn’t available as a digital copy.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/they-curdle-like-milk-wb-dvds-from-2006-2008-are-rotting-away-in-their-cases/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/they-curdle-like-milk-wb-dvds-from-2006-2008-are-rotting-away-in-their-cases/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f9ce80b380ac4af8b267575c506e6ae7c06e159808806ff30bda9da8093c7ca","category":"Tech"}
