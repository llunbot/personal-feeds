The doorbell would likely work with third-party HomeKit locks, but Apple could also partner with another brand to offer an all-in-one solution, he said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's doorbell would compete with Amazon's line of Ring doorbells, but Gurman did not say if Apple's solution would capture video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple would almost certainly tout the privacy and security benefits of its own smart home doorbell. If the product is ever released, Gurman expects that it will be equipped with Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/\">rumored Wi-Fi chip</a>, which is said to have a Secure Enclave to protect user data. And if the doorbell does end up offering video capture, Apple already has a HomeKit Secure Video service with end-to-end encryption for storing footage in iCloud.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman believes Apple's doorbell is unlikely to launch until 2026 at the earliest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple seemingly has plans to make a bigger push into the smart home space over the next few years. In addition to this doorbell, the company is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/21/homepod-with-7-inch-display-report/\">launch a smart home hub next year</a>, and it is also rumored to be planning its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">own HomeKit-enabled indoor security camera</a> that would compete with products like Logitech's Circle View.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-doorbell-with-face-id-rumor/\">Apple Rumored to Launch Smart Home Doorbell With Face ID and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rumored-to-launch-smart-home-doorbell-with-face-id-and-more.2445921/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c9242cf5416b7b4614e026d7fe303124b2757f264cc4a2e07739c3620f1b35e1","category":"Apple"}
