Among the new features coming to Macs are changes to Widgets, a new Game Mode, the ability to easily turn web pages into web apps, and fun additions to video conferencing apps. Read on for the lowdown on all the new features and improvements coming later in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final version of macOS 14 will be released to the general public in the fall. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships. Here are the release dates for the previous five versions of macOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>macOS 13 Ventura:</strong> October 24, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 12 Monterey:</strong> October 25, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 11 Big Sur:</strong> November 12, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 10.15 Catalina:</strong> October 7, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>macOS 10.14 Mojave:</strong> September 24, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On that basis, we predict that macOS Sonoma will arrive on October 23, 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma: Beta release date and latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is currently testing a developer version and a public version of the beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest developer beta of Sonoma is version 6, which arrived on August 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest public beta of Sonoma is version 3, which arrived on August 9. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>June 5:</strong> macOS 14 is revealed and the developer beta is released.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>J<strong>une 21: </strong>Apple releases second developer beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 5: </strong>Apple releases third developer beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 12:</strong> Apple released the first public beta.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 25</strong>: Apple released the fourth developer beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 31</strong>: Apple releases its second public beta and a revised version of the fourth developer beta (following prior installation difficulties).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>August 8</strong>: Developer beta 5 is released. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>August 9</strong>: Public beta 3 is released. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>June to September/October:</strong> This is the beta testing period. Apple will release several beta updates during this time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>September/October:</strong> macOS 14 is released to the general public.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma: How to install the beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple changed the beta process in macOS 13.4, so the way to install the macOS 14 beta is different from what it was previously. Instead of downloading the Beta Access Utility for every device, you’ll only need to register your Apple ID for the beta program to install betas on every Apple device that is signed into that account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then when you go to Software Update, you’ll see a new tab for <em>Beta Updates</em>, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. For example, if you want to install the public beta, select <em>macOS 14 Public Beta</em>. If you want to stay in Ventura, select <em>Off</em>. To install the official version, you need to wait for Apple to start shipping it in the fall. Then, you’ll be able to use Software Update in System Settings, or you can download it from the App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: betas are not as stable as the official version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install the beta, follow our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">macOS beta installation guide</a>. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove macOS Sonoma beta</a>.

Some new features may also require Apple chips and not run on Intel-based Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out which version of macOS older Macs can run take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/782634/macos-ventura-compatibility.html\">compatibility list</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma new features: What coming to the Mac this fall?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has revealed some of the new features coming in macOS 14. Here’s what to expect.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-14-widgets.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"macOS Sonoma Widgets\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-14-widgets.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-14-widgets.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-14-widgets.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-14-widgets.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Read our comparison of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://macOS%20Sonoma%20and%20macOS%20Ventura.&amp;xcust=1-1-1670742-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">macOS Sonoma and macOS Ventura</a> for more details about what’s changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Widgets </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be able to add more Widgets from the Widget Gallery and place them anywhere on the screen. Apple has gone to lengths to make sure they aren’t distracting–they should be “glanceable without feeling intrusive” according to the company. You will also be able to add Widgets from an iPhone using Continuity.; the iPhone just needs to be nearby, on or same Wi-Fi network.

It will, Apple says, make gaming on Mac “more immersive.” There are also changes that should reduce latency with controllers and improve in-game responsiveness. These sound like improvements that could help improve gaming on the Mac, but it may just be too little too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced that there are more Mac games coming, and demonstrated “Death Stranding: Directors Cut” (which is unfortunately not a new game). Apple also explained how it will help game developers bring their games to the Mac with a new Game Porting kit that includes tools that devs can use to quickly port their games to the Mac, significantly reducing the game development time. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1945978/game-porting-toolkit-gaming-mac-valve-proton.html\">Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit is the first real step to fixing Mac gaming.</a> We also explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1993906/how-to-game-mode-macos-14-sonoma.html\">How to use Game Mode to boost performance.</a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"macOS Sonoma Meeting presentation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption>You will appear in front of your presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Video Conferencing features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple described how when you share your screen during a presentation your presence can get lost. To fix this issue Apple has devised a new video effect called Presenter Overlay which will overlay your face over the presentation, separating you from the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features include the ability to add a reaction to your video to show how you feel about something. For example, if you show two thumbs up a fireworks animation will play. These features can also be used as video effects with other video conferencing apps, so it’s not tied to FaceTime. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More updates are coming to WebKit, including new typography. Private browsing will get a new feature that will block private browsing windows when you aren’t using them. It will be possible to share Passkeys and Passwords with family members, This will be end-to-end encrypted via iCloud Keychain. You will be able to create Safari Profiles so you can separate accounts between work and home/school profiles, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2010954/how-to-create-profile-safari-17.html\">How to create a new profile in Safari 17</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Web Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be easy to make a website you use a lot into a Web App. Just add a webpage to the Dock as an icon and open it to get an app-like appearance for that web page.  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1984619/macos-sonoma-how-to-web-apps.html\">Learn how to make and manage Web Apps in macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Web Apps in macOS Sonoma\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cb5570e4787baa4d1a71519ac07931982e4cc3fc71d849cf5162317f4e5cb682","category":"Apple"}
