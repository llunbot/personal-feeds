It began in mid-1980 as QDOS, or \"Quick and Dirty Operating System,\" the work of developer Tim Paterson at a company called Seattle Computer Products (SCP). It was later renamed 86-DOS, after the Intel 8086 processor, and this was the version that Microsoft licensed and eventually purchased.</p>\n<p>Last week, Internet Archive user <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/@f15sim\">f15sim</a> discovered and uploaded a new-old version of 86-DOS to the Internet Archive. Version 0.1-C of 86-DOS is <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/86-dos-version-0.1-c-serial-11-original-disk\">available for download here</a> and can be run using the SIMH emulator; before this, the earliest extant version of 86-DOS was <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/86-dos-version-0.34-c-serial-221-original-disk\">version 0.34</a>, also uploaded by f15sim.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993233#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993233&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7f1b34de48d65f6d460b610535fee8c8eddfd98b9fa0cde9043a3b41dee8c766","category":"Tech"}
