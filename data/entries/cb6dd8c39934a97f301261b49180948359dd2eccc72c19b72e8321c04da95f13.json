The midlife update for model-year 2024 was notable because Porsche has put some buttons and other physical controls back where they belong, after the all-touchscreen dalliance that is the Taycan electric car. This evening, the German automaker showed off the rest of the 2024 Cayenne and released some technical details, including what sounds like a decent upgrade to the plug-in hybrid version.</p>\n<p>As is normally the case with a midlife update, there's new styling for the Cayenne front end that in this case includes new headlight clusters as well as a new front bumper and hood. The taillights and rear fascia are also new, and Porsche has added three new colors, including a pair of metallic blues.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-Porsche-Cayenne-2-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"There are new taillights. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-Porsche-Cayenne-2-980x654.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-Porsche-Cayenne-2-scaled.jpg\">There are new taillights. </a> (credit: Porsche )</p></div>\n<p>There have been some more significant changes under the skin of the Cayenne E-Hybrid, the plug-in variant that for 2024 will start at $91,700.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932367#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932367&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
