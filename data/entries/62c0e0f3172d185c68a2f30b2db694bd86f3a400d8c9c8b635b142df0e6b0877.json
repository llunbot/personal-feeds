{"title":"In the works – New Availability Zone in Maryland for US East (Northern Virginia) Region","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-new-availability-zone-in-maryland-for-us-east-n-virginia-region/","date":1745530821000,"content":"<p>The US East (Northern Virginia) Region was the first <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html\">Region</a> launched by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, and it has seen tremendous growth and customer adoption over the past several years. Now hosting active customers ranging from startups to large enterprises, AWS has steadily expanded the US East (Northern Virginia) Region infrastructure and capacity. The US East (Northern Virginia) Region consists of six <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-availability-zones.html\">Availability Zones</a>, providing customers with enhanced redundancy and the ability to architect highly available applications.</p> \n<p>Today, we’re announcing that a new Availability Zone located in Maryland will be added to the US East (Northern Virginia) Region, which is expected to open in 2026. This new Availability Zone will be connected to other Availability Zones by high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections over dedicated, fully redundant fiber. The upcoming Availability Zone in Maryland will also be instrumental in supporting the rapid growth of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/\">generative AI</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ac.html\">advanced computing workloads</a> in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region.</p> \n<p>All Availability Zones are physically separated in a Region by a meaningful distance, many kilometers (km) from any other Availability Zone, although all are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other. The network performance is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication between Availability Zones in Maryland and Virginia within the US East (Northern Virginia) Region. If your application is partitioned across multiple Availability Zones, your workloads are better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and more.</p> \n<p>With this announcement, AWS now has four new Regions in the works—<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-new-zealand/\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/3/aws-to-launch-an-infrastructure-region-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia\">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-taiwan/\">Taiwan</a>, and the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-european-sovereign-cloud/\">AWS European Sovereign Cloud</a>—and 13 upcoming new Availability Zones.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Geographic information for the new Availability Zone</u></strong><br /> In March, we provided more granular visibility into the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-geography-information-for-all-aws-regions-and-availability-zones/\">geographic location information</a> of all AWS Regions and Availability Zones. We have updated the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-availability-zones.html\">AWS Regions and Availability Zones</a> page to reflect the new geographic information for this upcoming Availability Zone in Maryland. As shown in the following screenshot, the infrastructure for the upcoming Availability Zone will be located in <strong>Maryland</strong>,<strong> United States of America</strong>, for the US East (Northern Virginia) <code>us-east-1</code> Region.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/23/2025-in-the-works-new-az-in-us-east-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1952\" height=\"1144\" /></p> \n<p>You can continue to use this geographic information to choose Availability Zones that align with your regulatory, compliance, and operational requirements.</p> \n<p>After the new Availability Zone is launched, it will be available along with other Availability Zones in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region through the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com\">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/\">AWS SDKs</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Stay tuned<br /> </u></strong>We plan to make this new Availability Zone in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region generally available in 2026.
