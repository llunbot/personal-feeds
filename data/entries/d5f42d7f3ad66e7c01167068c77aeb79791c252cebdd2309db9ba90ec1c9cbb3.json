{"title":"iOS 18: Create Dark Mode Icons for Apps That Won't Go Dark","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-18-create-a-dark-mode-icon-for-almost-any-app/","date":1729588520000,"content":"Have you tried making your iPhone's Home Screen app icons dark using the new customization options in iOS 18? If so, you may have run up against the issue that, despite all efforts, some app icons simply refuse to turn dark. Well, we may have a solution for you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/dark-mode-icons-custom.jpg\" alt=\"dark mode icons\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nIt's been over two months since Apple released iOS 18, but not all app developers have updated their apps to include equivalent dark mode icons (we're looking at you, Amazon). And while iOS 18 tries to automatically generate dark icons when developers haven't provided them, it doesn't always work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf that leaves one or two light icons spoiling your otherwise carefully crafted dark-themed Home Screen, don't despair. The following steps describe a relatively simple method you can use that will give most stubborn app icons a passable dark appearance.

The icon will be saved in your photo library.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/get-app-icon-shortcut.jpg\" alt=\"shortcuts\" width=\"4377\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Next, save the following dark-background image to your photo library (long press ‚ûù <strong>Save to Photos</strong>): [<a href=\"https://ibb.co/6r5kkmn\">Image Link</a>]</li>\r<br />\n<li>Visit Remove.bg's <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/t/change-background\">\"change background\" web tool</a>, then tap the blue <strong>Upload Image</strong> button and choose the app icon that's saved in your photos.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Under \"Background Image,\" tap <strong>Select File</strong>, then choose the dark background image that's also saved in your photos.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Press and hold the resulting image on the remove.bg webpage, then tap <strong>Save to Photos</strong> in the contextual menu.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/custom-dark-mode-app-icon.jpg\" alt=\"twitch\" width=\"4377\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Now, open Shortcuts and tap the <strong>+</strong> button at the top to create a new Shortcut, then select the <strong>Open App</strong> action.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap the blue \"App\" text in the \"Open App\" action, then choose the app whose icon you want to make dark.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap the chevron at the top of the screen, select <strong>Add to Home Screen</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Label the shortcut as the app's name and choose your custom dark icon for the photo, then tap <strong>Add</strong> to finish.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/home-screen-shortcut-dark-app-icon.jpg\" alt=\"custom dark icon\" width=\"4377\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\n</li></ol>With a bit of luck, your custom dark mode icon will look the part on your personalized Home Screen. Note: If you have several app icons that you want to create dark mode equivalents for, make sure to create a new \"Open App\" shortcut for each one as you go. If you don't, you may end up accidentally creating several icon shortcuts that refer back to the same app.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-18-create-a-dark-mode-icon-for-almost-any-app/\">iOS 18: Create Dark Mode Icons for Apps That Won't Go Dark</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-create-dark-mode-icons-for-apps-that-wont-go-dark.2440668/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d5f42d7f3ad66e7c01167068c77aeb79791c252cebdd2309db9ba90ec1c9cbb3","category":"Apple"}
