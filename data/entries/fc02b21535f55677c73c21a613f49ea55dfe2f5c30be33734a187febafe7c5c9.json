We now have a full trailer, unveiled at SXSW after the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-last-of-us-has-its-final-season-2-trailer-leaked-and-everyones-hyped/\">footage leaked</a> over the weekend, chock-full of Easter eggs for gaming fans of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/meet-the-real-zombifying-fungus-behind-the-fictional-last-of-us-outbreak/\">The series takes place</a> in the 20-year aftermath of a deadly outbreak of mutant fungus (<em>Cordyceps</em>) that turns humans into monstrous zombie-like creatures (the Infected, or Clickers). The world has become a series of separate totalitarian quarantine zones and independent settlements, with a thriving black market and a rebel militia known as the Fireflies making life complicated for the survivors. Joel (Pedro Pascal) is a hardened smuggler tasked with escorting the teenage Ellie (Bella Ramsay) across the devastated US, battling hostile forces and hordes of zombies, to a Fireflies unit outside the quarantine zone. Ellie is special: She is immune to the deadly fungus, and the hope is that her immunity holds the key to beating the disease.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/last-of-us-s2-trailer-features-wintry-war-with-the-zombies/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/last-of-us-s2-trailer-features-wintry-war-with-the-zombies/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc02b21535f55677c73c21a613f49ea55dfe2f5c30be33734a187febafe7c5c9","category":"Tech"}
