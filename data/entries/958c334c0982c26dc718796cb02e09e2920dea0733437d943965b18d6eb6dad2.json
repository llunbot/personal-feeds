Gurman said the chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, so that could end up being a key upgrade for both devices. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current Apple TV from October 2022 supports Wi-Fi 6, and the upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E seems likely. It is unclear if the Wi-Fi 6E capability will be enabled in the next HomePod mini, however, as Apple has generally kept its HomePod speakers on older Wi-Fi versions. For example, the current HomePod mini supports outdated Wi-Fi 4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, the next Apple TV is also expected to be equipped with a newer A-series chip for faster performance. The current Apple TV is equipped with the A15 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 13 models in 2021. Apple has released several newer A-series chips since then, including the A16 Bionic, A17 Pro, A18, and A18 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe next Apple TV could have lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/\">could have a sub-$100 starting price</a>. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for $129 and $149, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/\">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/\">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the HomePod mini, likely upgrades for the next model include a newer \"S\" chip, improved sound quality, a newer Ultra Wideband chip for a lower-latency Handoff experience, and fresh color options. The current HomePod mini was released in November 2020 and uses the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to a new HomePod mini, Apple reportedly plans to release an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">all-new smart home hub</a> at some point this year. The hub is expected to feature around a six-inch display that can be mounted on a wall, or attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, so the device could be similar to the HomePod mini in some ways.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-common-feature/\">New Apple TV and HomePod Mini Launching This Year With One Thing in Common</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-launching-this-year-with-one-thing-in-common.2446966/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"958c334c0982c26dc718796cb02e09e2920dea0733437d943965b18d6eb6dad2","category":"Apple"}
