As with any feature in testing, the report cautions that Apple could choose not to release it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the report:<blockquote>Apple products have already detected more than 10 million suspected vehicle impacts, of which more than 50,000 included a call to 911.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been using the 911 call data to improve the accuracy of its crash-detection algorithm, since an emergency call associated with a suspected impact gives Apple more confidence that it is indeed a car crash, according to the documents.</blockquote>The feature sounds similar to Fall Detection on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer, which can detect if the wearer has experienced a hard fall and automatically call emergency services unless they indicate that they are okay.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle already <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7055029?hl=en#zippy=%2Cturn-on-car-crash-detection\">offers a car crash detection feature</a> on some recent Pixel smartphone models.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/apple-car-crash-detection-feature-report/\">iPhones and Apple Watches Could Detect a Car Crash and Auto-Dial 911 Starting Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphones-and-apple-watches-could-detect-a-car-crash-and-auto-dial-911-starting-next-year.2321112/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=01oJKLJK28Y:xbLmIyR6McY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=01oJKLJK28Y:xbLmIyR6McY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/01oJKLJK28Y\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"80a0260993370b07cda0899480fb76c3eb44556646cda6dcc6e5d1052d370115","category":"Apple"}
