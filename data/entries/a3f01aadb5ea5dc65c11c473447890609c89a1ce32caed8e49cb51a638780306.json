But Synopsys’ tool, called DSO.ai, may prove the most far-reaching because Synopsys works with dozens of companies. The tool has the potential to accelerate semiconductor development and unlock novel chip designs, according to industry watchers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787115#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787115&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a3f01aadb5ea5dc65c11c473447890609c89a1ce32caed8e49cb51a638780306","category":"Tech"}
