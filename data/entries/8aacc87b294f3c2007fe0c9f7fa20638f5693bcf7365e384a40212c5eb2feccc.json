We've highlighted everything new in the second ‌iOS 18‌ beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone Mirroring</h2>\r<br />\nWhen paired with a Mac running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> beta 2, ‌iOS 18‌ beta 2 supports the Mac-based <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> Mirroring feature. With ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring, you can control your ‌iPhone‌ using your Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n‌iPhone‌ Mirroring can be enabled by clicking on the new ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring icon on a Mac and following the instructions. It lets you open and use apps, manage notifications, and more, all while your ‌iPhone‌ is locked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>RCS Toggle</h2>\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ beta 2 adds a toggle for the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a> messaging protocol that will replace SMS and MMS, but ‌RCS‌ is not yet functional. Right now, the ‌RCS‌ toggle only shows up for U.S. ‌iPhone‌ users who have a carrier that supports ‌RCS‌, which includes T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-beta-2-rcs-toggle.jpg\" width=\"2174\" height=\"1223\" />\r<br />\n‌RCS‌ will improve text messaging conversations with Android users, allowing for higher-quality images and videos, read receipts, typing indicators, Tapback support, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Home Screen</h2>\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> icon on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> now has a dark mode, which changes the background color of the app. There's also a wallpaper tinting toggle that can be used in automatic mode, something that wasn't an option before. The toggle makes the wallpaper you've chosen darker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/app-store-dark-mode-icon.jpg\" width=\"1460\" height=\"821\" />\r<br />\nFor some icons, the second beta improves the contrast of the tint feature by adding more dark areas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that tinting and icon color changes seem to be quite buggy in beta 2, and sometimes tints won't deactivate until the ‌iPhone‌ is restarted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Widgets</h2>\r<br />\nThere's a new Connected Card Wallet widget app, but it does not appear to be functional as of yet. Connected Cards integrate with the Wallet app to display total card balance and transaction history. In the United States, this feature only works with Discover at the current time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-wallet-app-connected-cards.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Passwords App</h2>\r<br />\nThere's a \"+\" button in the main view of the Passwords app when you open it, so you can add a new item without having to tap the \"All\" icon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-passwords-app.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Control Center</h2>\r<br />\nThe power button in the Control Center has a more pronounced haptic feel when pressing it, and it only triggers with a press rather than just a tap. The change will prevent the power button from accidentally being activated when using Control Center.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>EU App Ecosystem Changes</h2>\r<br />\nIn the European Union, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/ipados-18-beta-2-includes-eu-changes/\">iPadOS 18 beta adds support</a> for alternative app marketplaces and downloading apps from websites. These are the same changes that Apple made to the ‌iPhone‌ in iOS 17.4, with the updates now extended to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> as required by the European Commission.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<h2>More New Changes</h2>\r<br />\nKnow of a new feature in beta 2 that we left out?
