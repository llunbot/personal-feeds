That helps ensure 100 percent compatibility with the entire N64 cartridge library across all regions, Analogue promises, and should avoid the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/rp8nbp/why_is_it_often_said_that_n64_is_harder_to/\">long-standing accuracy and lag issues</a> inherent to most software-based emulation of the N64.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n                        <div>\n            <div>\n              <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-1440x960.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-scaled.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-980x653.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/analogue2-1440x960.jpg 1440w\" />\n              </a>\n              <div>\n                White and black hardware shells will be available for the Analogue 3D.\n                                  <div>\n                    Credit:\n                                          Analogue\n                                      </div>\n                              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n                  </div>\n      </figure>\n\n<p>To get that level of fidelity, the Analogue team spent four years programming an Altera Cyclone FPGA with a full 220,000 logic elements. That's a big step up from previous Analogue devicesâ€”the Analogue Pocket's main FPGA board featured just 49,000 logic elements three years ago. But the Analogue Pocket also included a second, 15,000-logic-element FPGA, which allowed it to run <a href=\"https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/\">an expanding list</a> of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/analogue-pocket-gets-future-minded-fpga-cores-update-with-mister-in-its-sights/\">openFPGA cores</a> to support games from other classic consoles.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"225f043ce4170d918fd10b9e037b3285cc0db716258cfa6110562aae224b90ae","category":"Tech"}
