The initial plans started in 1956, with the first in a series of studies commissioned by the British Ministry of Supply, which set about exploring the idea of a supersonic transport plane—then, as now, the sole preserve of military jets.</p>\n<p>A parallel effort was also underway across the Channel in France, with both countries coming up with fairly similar designs. At some point, bean counters on both sides of <em>la manche</em> realized that the cost of developing such an extreme aircraft was perhaps better shared than borne alone, and in 1962 the two projects—one headed by the British Aircraft Corporation, the other by Sud-Aviation combined—were merged.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992236#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992236&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
