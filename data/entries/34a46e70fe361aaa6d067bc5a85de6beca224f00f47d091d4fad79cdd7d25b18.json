They\ngenerate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the\nsponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of\nthe DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and\nhopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’\nperspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many\nsponsors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the\nresults.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of\ninterest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality\nand good design, <a href=\"mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship\">get in touch</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is now true, once again for next week. And just like in March, <a href=\"http://neat.fm/\">sponsorship spots for The Talk Show</a> are open for the summer months as well.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/27/sponsors-summer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"34a46e70fe361aaa6d067bc5a85de6beca224f00f47d091d4fad79cdd7d25b18","category":"Tech"}
