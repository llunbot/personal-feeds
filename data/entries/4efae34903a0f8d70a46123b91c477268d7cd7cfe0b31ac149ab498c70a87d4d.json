Even toeing the edge is enough to have one longing for the unsettling warmth of a kiddie pool. But the brave souls at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have done it, wading into 25 years' worth of records on gastrointestinal outbreaks linked to the wellsprings of fecal pathogens. And they unsurprisingly found enough retch-inducing results to make any modern-day <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Snow-British-physician\">John Snows</a> want to start removing some water handles.</p>\n<p>Between 1997 and 2022, splash pads across the country were linked to at least 60 outbreaks, with the largest sickening over 2,000 water frolickers in one go. In all, the outbreaks led to at least 10,611 illnesses, 152 hospitalizations, and 99 emergency department visits. People, mostly children, were sickened with pathogens including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/hard-to-kill-poop-parasites-that-lurk-in-swimming-pools-on-the-rise-cdc-warns/\"><em>Cryptosporidium</em></a>,<em> Camplyobacter jejuni, Giardia duodenalis, Salmonella, Shigella, </em>and norovirus, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/ss/ss7308a1.htm?s_cid=ss7308a1_w\">the analysis, published Tuesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</a>. The tallies of outbreaks and illnesses are likely undercounts, given reporting delays and missed connections.</p>\n<p>Though previous <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/fecal-fountains-cdc-warns-of-diarrheal-outbreaks-linked-to-poopy-splash-pads/\">outbreak-based studies</a> have provided bursts of data, the new analysis is the first to provide a comprehensive catalog of all the documented outbreaks since splash pads erupted in the 1990s. Together, they provide a clear, stomach-churning explanation of how the outbreaks keep happening. Basically, small children go into the watery playgrounds while they're sick and spread their germs.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/from-diapers-to-mouths-of-babes-how-splash-pads-sickened-over-10k/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/from-diapers-to-mouths-of-babes-how-splash-pads-sickened-over-10k/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4efae34903a0f8d70a46123b91c477268d7cd7cfe0b31ac149ab498c70a87d4d","category":"Tech"}
