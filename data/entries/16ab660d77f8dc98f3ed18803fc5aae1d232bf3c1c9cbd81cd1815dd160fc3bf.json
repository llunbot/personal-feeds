You can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/?th=1\">get the 11-inch model for $549 right now at Amazon</a>, a savings of $50 off Apple’s MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again — this is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2595313/ipad-air-2025-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">pretty much the same iPad Air</a> as the previous model, with the only upgrade being the new chip. Admittedly, the M3 is faster than the M2, so if you’re looking for a speedier tablet that can quickly load your apps and games, and run Apple Intelligence, the new iPad Air is a solid pick for the same price as before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tablet’s gorgeous Liquid Retina Display may be the same as the one we saw in the M1 and M2 iPad Air, but it’s still an amazing screen that will deliver billions of colors, vivid images, deep contrast, and an overall fantastic experience. The 12MB Center Stage camera (which is on the landscape edge) will deliver excellent quality for your video calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want the fastest iPad Air around, you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/?th=1\">get it for $549 right now over at Amazon</a>.
