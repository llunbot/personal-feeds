We expected the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">iOS 18 beta</a> to continue through the summer until its release in September, followed immediately by the iOS 18.1 beta. Then, iOS 18.1 would be released in October, and 18.2 beta testing would begin, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year is very different. More than a month ahead of the expected iOS 18 release, Apple began an iOS 18.1 beta test. It was made available for developers on July 29, but only for devices that are compatible with Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 16-series and M-series iPads – M-series Macs get the equivalent version of Seqioia). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wide release is scheduled for October 28.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about the new iPhone update in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18 superguide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated October 21:</strong> The release candidate of iOS 18.1 has been released, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2495890/apple-confirms-ios-18-1-is-coming-next-week.html\">wide release is scheduled for next week</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.1 release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s biggest iOS 18 feature is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>, a suite of AI tools and Siri enhancements that will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as later iPhones.

Beginning with iOS 17, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered developers can choose to get the iOS 18.1 beta instead by going to the Settings app, then <em>General &gt; Software Update,</em> and selecting <em>iOS Developer Beta</em> in the Beta Updates tab. When you return to the main Software Update screen, you’ll Upgrade to iOS 18 at the bottom of the screen under the Also Available heading. Tap that and it’ll take you to the iOS 18.1 beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, remember to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">back up your iPhone</a> before you install the beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to run the public beta, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Head to <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/\">beta.apple.com</a> and register your Apple ID for the beta.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> &gt; <em>Beta Updates</em> and select the beta you wish to install.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the beta.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ac6e1e70ef55cb96ad87d333fafda4b4d6012445e671c69b5a6c986db9766b87","category":"Apple"}
