{"title":"Wahoo Fitness CEO On Future Wahoo Products, Past Mistakes","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/12/wahoo-fitness-ceo-interview-products-mistakes.html","date":1703165656000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>Last week while visiting Wahoo Fitness, I sat down with the founder and current co-CEO of the company, Chip Hawkins, for a wide-ranging interview discussing everything from past Wahoo initiatives (and failures), to the status of current products, as well as what the future brings. We covered a lot of ground, and rather than try and slice it down to a smaller size, I’ve just left the whole thing as one big interview. I’ve YouTube-chaptered the various portions linked below, though I think you’ll find a lot of it fascinating.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we covered, noting that you can easily just listen to it podcast style in the background:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=0s\">0:00</a> Quick Intro &amp; Wahoo Company Size/Employees<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=40s\">0:40</a> Wahoo Docks vs Wahoo Fitness<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=112s\">1:52</a> Which Wahoo product is his true favorite<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=160s\">2:40</a> Future of Wahoo Rival watch?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=226s\">3:46</a> Why are Wahoo products so expensive?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=324s\">5:24</a> Why hasn’t Wahoo trainers changed design?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=390s\">6:30</a> Why did the RGT acquisition fail?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=466s\">7:46</a> Why did you drop lawsuit with Zwift?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=542s\">9:02</a> What happens next with Zwift partnership?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=597s\">9:57</a> What about how that impacts competitors?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=656s\">10:56</a> Are open standards dead?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=750s\">12:30</a> Why hasn’t the KICKR Desk been updated?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=788s\">13:08</a> Plans for Wahoo CLIMB, Headwind Fan, etc…<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=813s\">13:33</a> Single favorite run/ride route in world?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=915s\">15:15</a> Do you worry about fitness industry consolidation?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=958s\">15:58</a> Where does AI work in fitness best today?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1010s\">16:50</a> Why did you close Boulder sport performance center?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1068s\">17:48</a> How is Wahoo structured geographically?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1155s\">19:15</a> What’s Wahoo’s biggest market?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1175s\">19:35</a> Is the indoor cycling industry recovering?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1260s\">21:00</a> Are you hiring employees again?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1310s\">21:50</a> How did Wahoo buy itself back from banks?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1462s\">24:22</a> Is Wahoo financially sound now?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1500s\">25:00</a> Why isn’t SYSTM on Apple TV?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1562s\">26:02</a> Is the ELEMNT Bike GPS still competitive?<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfYi8jU4ss&amp;t=1650s\">27:30</a> What’s coming in 2024?</p>\n<p>Again, I think you’ll find a slate of nuggets throughout this interview. Obviously, there are some pretty big hints at the future in there on a lot of products – both in terms of new products, but also ones going away. Give it a listen, and again, there’s very little that requires foreground attention, so it’s perfect to just set in the background and listen through.</p>\n<p>At some point I’ll edit together a post with the actual behind-the-scenes tour of their HQ, testing labs, museum of sorts, and plenty more. But for now, go forth and enjoy the interview.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for watching!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"bb7832a4ddc852e95ffe0bfe215353114cf1797b2d7d06709017c5b5f493d72d","category":"Cycling"}
