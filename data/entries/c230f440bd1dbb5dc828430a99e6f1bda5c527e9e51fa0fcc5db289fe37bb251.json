Last year, the American luxury automaker started building the Lyriq, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/\">a rather competent midsize electric SUV</a>. Last month, it revealed plans for an entry-level electric crossover called the Optiq, which goes on sale next year. And today, it tells us there's another new SUV due in model year 2026, called the Vistiq.</p>\n<p>Size-wize, the Vistiq slots between the Lyriq and the ginormous <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/cadillac-reveals-the-2025-escalade-iq-one-excessive-ev/\">Escalade IQ</a> due for model year 2025â€”the brand recognition on that name is far too good to Q-icize it directly. Although we have no details other than the model year and the name right now, there's a fairly good chance the Vistiq will be an electric analogue to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-2020-cadillac-xt6-better-than-an-escalade-in-every-way/\">Cadillac XT6</a>.</p>\n<p>(Similarly we have no further details on the Optiq yet other than that it will share the same smaller crossover architecture as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/chevrolet-readies-a-30000-equinox-ev-crossover-for-2023/\">forthcoming Chevrolet Equinox</a> and will arrive in 2024.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991048#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991048&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
