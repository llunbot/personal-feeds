Your phone lies flat and horizontally in the holder. Pushing down the paddles tilts your phone screen, which steers your RGT avatar.</p>\n<p>Wahoo says you can’t crash, but will be held up behind another virtual rider for a couple of seconds if you fail to steer around them.</p>\n<p>The technology brings RGT Cycling up to speed with the competition. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/zwift-steering/\">Zwift steering</a> was launched in 2020.</p>\n<p>For some, the introduction of a skill-based element to training and racing on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rgt-cycling-guide/\">RGT Cycling</a> will add to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/indoor-vs-outdoor-cycle-training/\">benefits of indoor cycling</a>.

It measures 370mm long and 110mm high, weighing 100g, according to Brooks.</p>\n<p>However, the British brand claims the bag’s Hypalon Velcro straps and buckle straps will keep it in place over off-road bumps if more relaxed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a> is your cup of trailside-brewed, single-origin coffee.</p>\n<p>The Scape Top Tube Bag Long comes in black as pictured and a more gravelly shade of moss green.</p>\n<p>Other features include a reflective side Brooks logo and a front TPU cable hole through which you can connect your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> to a power pack. Or you can run a charging cable from your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-dynamos/\">bike dynamo</a> to your mobile phone in the bag.</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, the two sliders on the full-length, coated zip enable you to access the contents of the bag on the go with one hand.</p>\n<ul><li>£59.99</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Styrkr energy products</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Styrkr’s endurance fuel contains more carbs than many rival brands.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Styrkr says its sport nutrition products help you ride harder for longer, thanks to their scientifically formulated, high-carb content.</p>\n<p>All of the brand’s energy products contain both maltodextrin and fructose. Nutritionists have found this ‘dual-carb’ mix enables athletes to absorb 90 to 120g of carbohydrate an hour, compared to 30 to 60g from a single type of sugar.</p>\n<p>Such a large carb intake can help you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-avoid-bonking-on-a-bike-ride/\">avoid bonking on a bike ride</a>, for instance during <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/ultra-distance-cycling/\">ultra-endurance cycling events</a>. At the top level, dual-carb fuelling turbo-charged Chris Froome’s astonishing breakaway on stage 19 of the 2018 Giro d’Italia.</p>\n<p>Styrkr’s Mix90 energy drink powder packs a similar punch to Froomey’s fuel during his solo attack. It contains 90g of carbs in the ideal 1:08 ratio of maltodextrin:fructose, 2g of electrolytes to ward off cramps and 3g of L-Glutamine, which is claimed to help prevent fatigue.</p>\n<p>Styrkr recently released a rice energy bar, its first piece of solid on-the-bike food. The Bar50 delivers 50g of carbs in 250kcal and comes in three flavours: dark chocolate chip; date, almond and sea salt; and apple, cinnamon, caramel and sultana.</p>\n<p>All products can be bought separately or in bundles.</p>\n<ul><li>Styrkr taster kit £11.99</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>Attaquer x Egle Zvirblyte Psychedelic jersey</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><p>Car headlights won’t be the only dazzling thing on the road once deputy editor Jack Luke is out and about in this jazzy jersey.</p>\n<p>Following on from Felix Smith’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/felix-smiths-gear-of-the-year-2022/\">Alé Kenya jersey</a>, all-over print jerseys are officially the hottest thing to have at BikeRadar HQ.</p>\n<p>Truthfully, we’re now unsure who’s loudest on the road and the biggest attention seeker of the two.</p>\n<p>Attaquer’s latest jersey was produced in collaboration with Egle Zvirblyte.</p>\n<p>In the words of Attaquer, Zvirblyte produces “playful, psychedelic, character-driven illustrative work [that] explores identity, spirituality, body image and relationships with an unwavering inclusive energy”.</p>\n<p>That’s all well and good but, let’s be real – we know it was the funky frog design that revved Jack’s engine.</p>\n<p>The jersey has a racy aero fit and is available in men’s or women’s cuts.</p>\n<ul><li>£124.95 / $140 / €144.95</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://attaquercycling.com/products/atq-ez-psychedelics-jersey\">Buy the ATQ x Egle Zvirblyte Psychedelic jersey direct from Attaquer</a></li>\n</ul><h2></h2>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"13f99cedbc755000a7f932527a052072c9facea6e030c28398800b069d60074c","category":"Cycling"}
