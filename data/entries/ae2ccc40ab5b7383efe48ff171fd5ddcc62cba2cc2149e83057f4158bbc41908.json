Project321 has trimmed back the number of pawls inside the hub, which slows down the engagement slightly but makes it quieter and infinitesimally reduces drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-5-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"internal ratchet ring and pawl details on prototype gravel hubs from project 321\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-5-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-5-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-5.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The big difference between the mountain bike hubs, which have eight pawls working in pairs of two, is the halving of of the pawls to four. This increases the engagement from 1.25º for the MTB hubs to 2.55º for gravel, with an effective 144 points of engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two pawls remain engaged at all time, with the other two phased by half a step to engage next. That’s still really quick, especially for gravel (or road) where you’re maintaining a constant cadence. The pawls are magnetically pulled into engagement, so there are no small springs that can pop out during servicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-3-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype gravel hubs from project 321\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-3.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubs place two double-row bearings at the edges of the freehub body, typically the point experiencing the highest torque and sheer forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-7-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"brake rotor mounting adapters for prototype gravel hubs from project 321\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-7-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-7-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC24-prototype-Project321-gravel-bike-hubs-7.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They use their same 6-Lock rotor rings, letting you run 6-bolt or Center Lock rotors on the same hub. They’re natively Center Lock, but use a lock-ring style attachment to fix 6-bolt rotors to them.
