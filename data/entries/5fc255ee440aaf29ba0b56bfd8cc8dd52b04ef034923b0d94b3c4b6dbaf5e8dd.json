All of the M4 Macs aren’t being released at the same time, however, and since Apple doesn’t really stick to a set schedule like the iPhone or Apple Watch, it can be confusing to figure out when each Mac is coming and what kind of upgrades will be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the rumors are correct, every Mac in Apple’s lineup will get an update within the next 12 months. Here’s a guide for when each model will get the M4 chip, and what else to expect from each upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>M4 MacBook Air</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-front-angle-left.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"15 inch MacBook Air 2024\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The MacBook Air will wait until 2025 for its M4 upgrade.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"15 inch MacBook Air 2024\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The MacBook Air will wait until 2025 for its M4 upgrade.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"15 inch MacBook Air 2024\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The MacBook Air will wait until 2025 for its M4 upgrade.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Release date</strong>: The M4 upgrade for the MacBook Air looks like an opportunity for Apple to set a regular release period for the company’s most popular Mac. The M4 MacBook Air is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2025, about a year after Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Air was released in November 2020; the M2 Air in July 2022; the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air was released in June 2023. The M4 Air release is a chance to establish a spring cycle for the MacBook Air that Apple could make a regular event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: Apple won’t change anything about the MacBook Air design. The current design was introduced in 2022 and it won’t change for several more years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chip</strong>: The 2025 MacBook Air will have a base M4 chip, similar to that used in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">iPad Pro</a>. Benchmark results show that the M4 offers a 20 percent improvement over the M3 it will replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong>: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Liquid Retina display, change the port configuration (MagSafe 3, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the <a href=\"https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-certified-7\">standard official</a> at the beginning of January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">Find out the latest about the M4 MacBook Air</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>M4 MacBook Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"space black macbook pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The MacBook Pro will get its M4 upgrade this fall.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"space black macbook pro\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The MacBook Pro will get its M4 upgrade this fall.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"space black macbook pro\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The MacBook Pro will get its M4 upgrade this fall.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Release date</strong>: The fall timeframe seems to be what Apple has settled on for MacBook Pro releases. Apple will likely release the M4 series of MacBook Pro this fall, in October or November. That would be about a year after Apple released the M3 MacBook Pro lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: Apple won’t change anything about the MacBook Pro design. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro design was introduced in 2021. This design will be in place for a few more years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chip</strong>: Apple releases the MacBook Pro with three versions of its M-series chip: A base chip, a Pro chip, and a Max chip. The M4 Pro and M4 Max will be variants of the base M4, implementing more CPU and GPU cores and more unified memory. The M4 chips will offer a 20 percent improvement over the M3 chips they replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong>: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Liquid Retina XDR display, change the port configuration (MagSafe 3, two or three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, HDMI, an SDXC Card slot, and a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers.

The current 24-inch iMac design was introduced in May 2021, and it will almost certainly remain in place for a few more years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chip</strong>: The 24-inch iMac features base M-series chips, so the new iMac will have the base M4. Benchmarks have shown that the M4 offers a 20 percent improvement over the M3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong>: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Retina display, change the port configuration (two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports (two additional USB-3 ports, and gigabit ethernet on the mid-and high-end models), and a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers.<a> </a>Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the <a href=\"https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-certified-7\">standard official</a> at the beginning of January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Rumors</a> say Apple could release a new iMac with a display as large as 32 inches and a higher-end M4 chip. It’s unlikely that such an iMac is ready for this fall, though Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2427403/apple-might-release-a-larger-imac-this-year.html\">recently reported</a> that “it’s unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2423527/m4-imac-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">Find out the latest about the M4 iMac</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>M4 Mac mini</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/m1-mac-mini-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac mini M1\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The M4 Mac mini may have a new, smaller design than the current M2 Mac mini (above).</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"Mac mini M1\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The M4 Mac mini may have a new, smaller design than the current M2 Mac mini (above).</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"Mac mini M1\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The M4 Mac mini may have a new, smaller design than the current M2 Mac mini (above).</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Release date</strong>: Reports indicate that Apple will release the M4 Mac mini this fall. It will replace the M2 Mac mini, which was released in January 2023. And the M1 Mac mini was released in November 2020. Apple could be taking this opportunity to establish a fall release cycle for the Mac mini, but based on the history of the product, the company doesn’t seem to believe that a regular release cycle is necessary for this product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2422215/the-mac-mini-is-getting-even-smaller-with-first-redesign-in-15-years.html\">Mac mini will undergo a drastic change</a>, according to Gurman. It will get even smaller, with a footprint about the size of the Apple TV. This would make the Mac mini more of a competitor to the Raspberry Pi, a small PC that’s often used in special setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chip</strong>: Apple currently offers the Mac mini with a base or Pro M-series chip, and this will continue with the new design. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Mac mini with a base M4 chip will ship “immediately,” while the M4 Pro model won’t be available until late October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong>: The smaller design could mean that the Mac mini doesn’t offer some of the ports the current Mac mini offers. Gurman reported that Apple has tested three models that have at least three USB-C ports, a power connector, and an HDMI port. And while Gurman didn’t say so, the USB-C ports are probably also Thunderbolt ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current M2 Mac mini has a gigabit ethernet port, USB-A ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The latest rumors don’t say whether the alignment will change. While the ethernet and audio jack are likely to stay, It’s possible that Apple will drop the USB-A ports.

The current Mac Studio was released in June 2023 at WWDC, while the first Mac Studio was released in March 2022. So, it appears that the M4 Mac Studio won’t arrive until spring 2025 or at WWDC 2025 in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: The Mac Studio’s design will be only three years old by the time it is updated to the M4, so it won’t change and will maintain its design for several more years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chip</strong>: Apple outfits the Mac Studio with Max and Ultra M-series chips. So, the 2025 Mac Studio will likely have M4 Max or M4 Ultra chips. The current Mac Studio features M2 Max and Ultra chips, so the jump in performance should be impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong>: Apple probably won’t change anything about the ports. On the back, the Mac Studio has four Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, two USB-A ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm audio jack. On the front of the Mac Studio is an SDXC Card slot; the Mac Studio Max has two USB 3 ports, while the Mac Studio Ultra has two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports.

The current Mac Pro was released in June 2023 at WWDC. The M4 Mac Pro won’t arrive until late 2025 or at the earliest, WWDC 2025 in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: Though the design of the Mac Pro is 11 years old, no reports of a redesign have been made. The Mac Pro is made to accommodate internal expansion cards, so if a redesign is in the work, it will keep the tower form factor, which separates it from the Mac Studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chip</strong>: Apple uses Ultra versions of its M-series chip for the Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro has a M2 Ultra; the upgrade in 2025 will be a M4 Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong>: No reports have been made about the Mac Pro’s features, and, likely, Apple won’t change anything about the slots, ports, or chassis.
