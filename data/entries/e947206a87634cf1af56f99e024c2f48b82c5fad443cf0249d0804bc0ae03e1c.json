The standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are expected to have an A16 Bionic chip.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Titanium frame:</strong> Like the Apple Watch Ultra, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/iphone-15-pro-titanium-gurman/\">have a titanium frame</a> instead of stainless steel.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Ultra-thin curved bezels:</strong> Similar to recent Apple Watch models, the iPhone 15 Pro will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/iphone-15-pro-front-glass-leak/\">ultra-thin curved bezels around the display</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Faster USB-C port:</strong> iPhone 15 Pro models will feature a USB-C port with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/\">support for at least USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3</a>, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, which would result in the devices having significantly faster data transfer speeds with a cable compared to existing iPhones with Lightning. Kuo said the USB-C port on standard iPhone 15 models will remain limited to USB 2.0 speeds like Lightning.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Wi-Fi 6E:</strong> Like the latest Macs and iPad Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro will support Wi-Fi 6E for faster wireless speeds, according to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/wifi-6e-iphone-15-pro-models/\">leaked schematic</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Increased RAM:</strong> iPhone 15 Pro models will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/iphone-15-pro-8gb-ram-rumor/\">equipped with an increased 8GB of RAM</a>, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce, while the standard models will likely continue to have 6GB of RAM as they do currently.
