For those that like to go off-roading and take their mountain bikes with them, new <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/2-super-duty\" target=\"_blank\">2″ Super Duty</a> is perfectly suited to the task. It was built for extreme off-roading from the drawing board, and it has some new features that are worth checking out. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-Haro-mounted.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-Haro-mounted.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack Haro mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-Haro-mounted.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-Haro-mounted-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-Haro-mounted-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-Haro-mounted-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack beefed up load arms\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefed-up-load-arms-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate impression when I saw the Super Duty up close was that it was very beefy. But, it’s rated for “extreme off-roading”, so naturally, it is beefed up where it needs to be. I don’t rock crawl in my Jeep, but the way the Super Duty is built, it looks like it could take it without a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rack is constructed from corrosion-resistant aluminum, which is used for the entirety of the build. I didn’t see any plastic being used. As usual, the rack supports bicycles without any contact with the frame or fork, using the load arms on the bike tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Super Duty has an adjustable tray length for bikes with a wheelbase up to 58″. It also has more spacing between the trays which adds extra room for wide downtubes and flat pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Neat New Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack wheel chock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Optional <strong>Wheel Chock</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my pet peeves with some tray-style racks is the continuous movement of the front wheel through the steerer tube, even when the bike is “locked and loaded”. This phenomenon worsens as the bike gets heavier or the road gets rougher. These instances are where the <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/wheel-chock\" target=\"_blank\">Wheel Chock</a> comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack ratchets for the wheel chock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-ratchets-for-the-wheel-chock-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Glide for the Wheel Chock</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wheel Chock was designed to reduce the amount of steerer tube rotation you get making the bike more stable while on the rack. 1UP states that the wheel chocks are required for bikes over 75lbs, or intense off-roading. However, anyone can use them under any circumstance if they’d prefer a more stable bike connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two different sizes of the Wheel Chock, Standard (fits tires up to 3″ wide) and Fat Tire (fits tires from 3″ to 5″). They are all aluminum and are sold separately for $110 each. That means if you have a two bike rack and wanted Wheel Chocks on both, it would be $220. Also, the Chocks are specific to wheel size so if you want to run both standard and fat bikes on the same rack with Chocks, you’d need to buy two sets. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>True One-Handed Operation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack release button close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-close-up-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Press the button to operate the load arms</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A welcome addition to the 2024 SD Rack is the addition of true one-handed operation of the rack. there are two ways to actuate the arms of the rack. If you want to use two hands to open the rack, just press the red button, lift the arm, load the bike, and adjust it to familiar ratcheting as you close the arms onto your tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack release button one handed mode\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-one-handed-mode-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Button housing up = One handed operation</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack release button ratchet mode\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-release-button-ratchet-mode-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Button housing down = ready to ratchet</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to use one hand on the rack and one to hold your bike, simply press the red button while lifting the button housing.

And some integrated locks are better than others. I would say that the 1Up USA <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/wheel-lock-1-4-turn\" target=\"_blank\">Wheel Lock 1/4 Turn</a> (long), is more of a deterrent than a full-blown lock. I like that it doesn’t come in contact with the bike in any way – if you have a bike rack with an integrated cable lock, it’s not a good idea to drive with it locked since it can rub through the paint on your bikes (or worse).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack wheel lock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-lock-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, when I stop for longer periods with my bike on the Jeep, I usually have it in sight. So, I’m very comfortable with this level of defense. 1UP USA states that most users run one lock per bike, though in higher crime areas, two isn’t a bad idea. The locks are $24 each, but if you buy more than one, you’ll get a 15% discount. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For additional protection, 1UP USA does offer higher levels of security with the <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/chain-lock\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Lock</a> and <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/cable-lock\" target=\"_blank\">Cable Lock</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The assembly of the rack was very easy, and straightforward. It can be done without even reading the directions, although complete and easy-to-follow directions are included.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-on-the-swing.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-on-the-swing.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack on the swing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-on-the-swing.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-on-the-swing-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-on-the-swing-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-on-the-swing-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a Jeep Wrangler and I need a swing adapter of some sort to be able to access the rear of the vehicle.

It comes with two proprietary security wrenches, one I keep in my shop, and one in the Jeep.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-mounted-e1718402640269.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-mounted-e1718402640269.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-mounted-e1718402640269.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-mounted-e1718402640269-297x115.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-mounted-e1718402640269-120x46.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-mounted-e1718402640269-768x296.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the actual hitch bar has a 3″ long slot machined into the side of it. This means that you have up to three inches of fore and aft adjustability when using the included hitch bar lock. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As tested, the 1UP USA Super Duty two-bike rack with all the accessories would run $1,259.80 with free ground shipping – the rack starts at $900 for the two-bike version. This is a premium rack, with a price to match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been up and down the mountain with it since installing the Super Duty two weeks ago. It’s easy to use, and the new features are a very welcome addition to the rack. I have yet to take it off-road but will be doing so soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When driving with a bike on the rack, even in strong wind, the bike didn’t move. The Wheel Chock makes a huge and very noticeable difference to the front wheel movement. When using the chock, front wheel movement was not even noticeable from the driver seat. It’s just unfortunate that it’s a $220 option for a two-bike rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-hero.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-hero.jpeg\" alt=\"2024 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-hero.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-hero-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-hero-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-hero-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, mountain bikes load on and off with ease, and the Wheel Chock is the perfect size to hold 2.6″ tires. I will be mounting the Salsa Moraine eMTB for a trip. That bike weighs in the neighborhood of 53lbs. But, with the Super Duty’s tray weight capacity at 100 lbs per tray, this shouldn’t be an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking forward to reporting back in a few months with my opinion after putting some serious mileage on the rack. Stay tuned here for the details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1up-USA.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-new-improved-1up-usa-2024-super-duty-double-hitch-bike-rack/\">First Look: New and Improved 1UP USA 2024 Super Duty Double Hitch Rack</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5672b0a9fae449eb5f0d844b16622001dcc875e77b27f2fd3e34bc1449105847","category":"Cycling"}
