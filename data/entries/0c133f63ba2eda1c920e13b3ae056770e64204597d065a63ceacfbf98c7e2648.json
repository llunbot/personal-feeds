Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>Concorde, NC—On Wednesday, Ford Performance held an official launch event for the 2024 season. The new GT3 version of the Mustang makes its competition debut at next weekend's Rolex 24 at Daytona, marking the start of a new approach to racing for the Blue Oval, one that involves selling customer race cars as a business line, not just a factory team. While we were there, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/ford-pushes-the-off-road-button-with-f-150-lightning-switchgear/\">we also rode in a new electric racing truck demonstrator</a>, but the main reason I got on the short flight down to Charlotte was to check out one of the most delightfully weird race cars of the past few years, the Ford Transit Supervan 4.2.</p>\n<p>It's the latest in a line of wild demonstrator vehicles based on the venerable Transit van, Ford's commercial workhorse in Europe and, increasingly, the US. Ford started making an electric version of the Transit a couple of years ago, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/weve-driven-fords-other-electric-workhorse-the-2022-e-transit/\">when we drove that electric van</a>, I might have driven a couple of the engineers and PR people to tears by repeatedly asking them, \"So, are you going to make a Supervan version of this, too?\"</p>\n<p>The first Supervan dates back to 1970 (or maybe 1971), when someone had the bright idea to stick a Transit body shell on a Ford GT40 race car chassis as a way to promote the new van. The 1980s and 1990s saw two new Supervans, this time using Formula 1 engines. Now that EVs are the new hotness, the appeal of an electric Supervan probably seemed obvious.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997403#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997403&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
