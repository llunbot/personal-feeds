That is despite the fact that the chips have been deliberately hobbled for the Chinese market to limit their capabilities, making them less effective than products available elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>The result has been soaring Chinese orders for the latest advanced US processors. China’s leading Internet companies have placed orders for $5 billion worth of chips from Nvidia, whose graphical processing units have become the workhorse for training large AI models.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962036#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962036&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d0b45ac08ab0af73702859748ede93212af7570abac40c92b0f93a28e790365f","category":"Tech"}
