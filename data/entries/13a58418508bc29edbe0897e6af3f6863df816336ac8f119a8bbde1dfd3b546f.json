The Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 feature Apple's third-generation optical heart rate sensor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Apple Watches will also feature an all-new \"U2\" ultra wideband chip, the first generational iteration of the component since the U1 chip's 2019 introduction in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 11 Pro. The new chip will improve the Apple Watch's location capabilities, allowing people and devices to be tracked more precisely in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> App. It is apparently set to come to all of the next versions of Apple's major products, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ will be manufactured with more recycled materials, as well as come in a black color option for the first time. As <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-3d-printing-device-components/\">previously reported</a>, the stainless steel ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ will feature a 3D-printed casing. Apple plans to start manufacturing the ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ with the technology starting next year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis year's main Apple Watch upgrade will be a new processor, which has to date effectively not been changed throughout three successive generations of the device. Apple apparently plans to \"heavily tout major gains in processing speed\" during its \"Wonderlust\" event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Apple Watch models will otherwise be largely unchanged compared to their predecessors. The company also plans to shift away from some of its leather watch bands, and there are signs that Apple may finally update or discontinue the Link Bracelet introduced alongside the original Apple Watch.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/\">Gurman: Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 to Feature New Heart Rate Monitor, More Accurate Sensors, U2 Chip, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-new-heart-rate-monitor-more-accurate-sensors-u2-chip-and-more.2400803/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"13a58418508bc29edbe0897e6af3f6863df816336ac8f119a8bbde1dfd3b546f","category":"Apple"}
