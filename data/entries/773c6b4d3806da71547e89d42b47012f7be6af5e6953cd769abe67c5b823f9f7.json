But on those occasions when we need to cart a laptop into the office, pack it in a suitcase, or add it to carry-on luggage, the need to protect it from bumps and scrapes should be paramount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too many times I’ve wrapped my laptop in a towel inside a suitcase, or dropped it into a rucksack and risked it not being protected. Sure, I could buy a bag designed for laptops, but they are often huge, bulky and heavy. So I end up slotting it in my usual bag and jumping on a train. What’s the worst that can happen…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the amount of money we spend on our Macs this approach is crazy. So when I had the opportunity to try out the <a href=\"https://www.manuel-dreesmann.com/collections/macbook-sleeves\" target=\"_blank\">Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesmann</a> just before going on vacation it seemed like a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take a look at our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229086/best-laptop-bags-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">best cases and bags for MacBook</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman isn’t cheap at $197/£153/€175, but you get luxury MacBook protection. It’s a slim leather sleeve that the MacBook slots into. I tried the 13-inch MacBook Air version, but there’s a sleeve for every current MacBook size, and the company says they can make a sleeve for any laptop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuel Dreesman is an independent atelier of handcrafted leather products, based in Barcelona, Spain. It ships all over the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sliding it in at first was a bit tight, but it got easier over time, leather being one of those materials that gets softer with use. Of course, the fit does need to be on the tight side as you wouldn’t want the MacBook to fall out or move around inside. Mine is one of the older style MacBook Air with a tapered edge, the newer 13-inch MacBook Air would probably not be as tough to slide into the case.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Leather Sleeve Manuel Dreesman\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1361w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Leather Sleeve Manuel Dreesman\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1361w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Leather Sleeve Manuel Dreesman\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1361w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Leather-Sleeve-Manuel-Dreesman.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The sleeve comes in a range vegetable-tanned leather colors. We tested the tan version, but there’s also black, cream, red, green, blue, orange, light blue and light green on offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leather is a good choice for a case like this, but it’s an expensive choice. You could opt for a cheaper fabric case, but leather is more durable and waterproof than fabric. It won’t suffer from wear and tear. Another option is silicon, which can be durable but can also wear and degrade over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, leather can be a problematic choice too, and obviously not one for vegans. Manuel Dreesmann claims that it sources the leather locally and that it is fine grain, which means it’s top quality. it makes the cases in its workshop in Barcelona using traditional techniques. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only criticism would be that the gaps at the bottom of the case, which probably make it easier to slide it in and out, stop it from being as waterproof or as protective as it might otherwise be. But that’s just a quirk of this design, the company makes other models that don’t share that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve mentioned that a leather case is an expensive choice, and it certainly is. But when you consider that leather cases can retail for a lot more, and even a cheaper silicon case can have a high price despite the materials being a lot cheaper, it’s probably a fair price for this kind of quality product. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Leather Sleeve Manuel Dreesman\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 900w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Leather Sleeve Manuel Dreesman\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 900w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Leather Sleeve Manuel Dreesman\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 900w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Macbook-Sleeve-16-Inch-Leather-Brown-Luxury-Case-Artisan-Vegetable-Tanned-Leather-Minimalist-Design-By-Manuel-Dreesman-Atelier-Madre-Barcelona-Spain.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leather sleeve is a good luxury option for those who habitually put their laptop unprotected in a bag or case.
