The policy applies to salespeople worldwide and is aimed at helping “grow skills,” per the note.</p>\n<p>Like the rest of Dell's workforce, Dell's salespeople have previously been allowed to work remotely two days per week. A memo, which a Reddit user claims to have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1fq5nu4/dell_is_now_100_rto_at_least_sales_and_sales/\">posted online</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/26/dell_sales_staff_full_rto/\">The Register</a> reported that the post “mirrors” one that it viewed separately), says that field sellers aren’t required to go into an office but “should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners.” The policy doesn’t apply to “remote sales team members,” but Dell said to expect additional unspecified communications regarding remote workers “in the coming weeks.” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-26/dell-dell-orders-salespeople-back-to-offices-5-days-a-week\">Bloomberg</a> reported that top sales executives Bill Scannell, Dell’s president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, president of sales and global regions at Dell Tech Select, signed the memo, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>… our data showed that sales teams are more productive when onsite.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dell is viewing mandatory on-site work as a way to maintain its sales team’s culture and drive growth, according to the memo, which mentions things like “real-time feedback” and “dynamic\" office energy. Moving forward, remote work will be permitted as an exception, Dell said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053090#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053090&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1550c51e861be4a741eb6e7bef4731ff4a7072a1ba1497aa8d38e68316cabc52","category":"Tech"}
