He said the idea was \"just for fun,\" but with his influential profile in the field, the idea may inspire others in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Karpathy's <a href=\"https://karpathy.ai/\">bona fides</a> in AI almost speak for themselves, receiving a PhD from Stanford under computer scientist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li\">Dr. Fei-Fei Li</a> in 2015. He then became one of the founding members of OpenAI as a research scientist, then served as senior director of AI at Tesla between 2017 and 2022. In 2023, Karpathy rejoined OpenAI for a year, leaving this past February. He's posted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy/videos\">several highly regarded tutorials</a> covering AI concepts on YouTube, and whenever he talks about AI, people listen.</p>\n<p>Most recently, Karpathy has been working on a project called \"<a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c\">llm.c</a>\" that implements the training process for OpenAI's 2019 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/once-too-scary-to-release-gpt-2-gets-squeezed-into-an-excel-spreadsheet/\">GPT-2</a> LLM in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)\">pure C</a>, dramatically speeding up the process and demonstrating that working with LLMs doesn't necessarily require complex development environments. The project's streamlined approach and concise codebase sparked Karpathy's imagination.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021482#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"72733f65d6ab3ba16bd3cd452c90a892d3dba733cca3954000a7e0b8159211f3","category":"Tech"}
