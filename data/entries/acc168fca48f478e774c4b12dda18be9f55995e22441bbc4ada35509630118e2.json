As we have now passed the watershed opening to the transfer market on 1st August, moves can start to be revealed publicly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means teams and riders can finally put us out of our misery and share the news of who’s gone where for 2025, though the rumours will keep on circling until all rosters are filled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the men, Simon Yates, Julian Alaphilippe and Ben O’Connor have made some of the biggest moves in the transfer market this year. There are also plenty of rumours brewing around riders cutting ties early, notably Tom Pidcock and Remco Evenepoel. On the women’s side, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> champion Demi Vollering is expected to move away from SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike are signing MTB World and Olympic champ Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, and Elisa Longo Borghini is on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Lidl-Trek sweep up some big names</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T170651.792.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek </a>have been very active in the women’s transfer window. With Elisa Longo Borghini leaving, the team have picked up some new recruits in the form of Emma Norsgaard, Niamh Fisher-Black and Anna Henderson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma Norsgaard, a stage winner at the Tour de France Femmes last year, is a strong Classics rider and time-triallist with a sprint kick to her. She’s previously won Le Samyn and the Festival Elsy Jacobs stage race. Along with Norsgaard, Niamh Fisher-Black will move to Lidl-Trek from SD Worx. Still just 24 years old, Fisher-Black is a promising GC talent. She recently finished in the top ten of GC at the Giro and Vuelta and has won a Grand Tour stage at the 2024 Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival of Brit Anna Henderson was announced earlier in the transfer window. The Olympic silver medalist will ride for the American team until 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These incomers will join 29-year-old Riejanne Markus, who has announced that she will leave<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\"> Visma-Lease a Bike</a> for Lidl-Trek. Markus finished the Vuelta Femenina as runner-up earlier this year.

The Tuscan has won eight stages of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>, from 2011 to 2020, as well as two Tours of Slovenia and the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal. For the statisticians out there, Diego Ulissi is the only rider to have won a pro race every year since 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘With strong results in both one-day races and week-long stage races, this is exactly what our team needs,’ says Alexander Vinokourov, the director of the Kazakh team. ‘I am confident that Diego will strengthen Astana Qazaqstan Team, becoming a leader in many races, while also being able to support his teammates when needed.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This news comes just a week after Wout Poels was announced to be joining the team. Astana continue to set their eyes on more transfers to help <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">solidify their WorldTour status</a>, with rumours circulating about the possible signing of Australian Caleb Ewan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Julian Alaphilippe and Marc Hirshi sign for Tudor Pro Cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"julian alaphilippe marc hirschi tudor pro cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Rafa Gomez - Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of speculation, Alaphilippe has finally settled on his new home for 2025. This will end a turbulent decade with the Belgian squad led by Patrick Lefevre. Their relationship soured over the past two years and it became clear earlier in the year that Alaphilippe, a double world champion, would be heading elsewhere. After confirming his departure from the Belgian team at the Klassikoa at the beginning of August, he has gone on to sign a contract with Swiss team Tudor Pro Cycling through to 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I liked the Tudor Pro Cycling project from the beginning,’ Alaphilippe explains. ‘I saw the team arrive and develop, and I also know a few of the riders and staff members. What better way to mark a turning point in my career than with a new and ambitious project?’ The Swiss team headed by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/fabian-cancellara-on-life-in-retirement-i-m-busier-now-than-when-i-raced\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Cancellara</a> has been growing in the past few seasons, courtesy of some big-name transfers such as Alberto Dainese, Arvid de Kleijn, Michael Storer and Matteo Trentin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh from a WorldTour victory at the Klasikoa, Marc Hirschi has also confirmed his transfer to Tudor Pro Cycling. This transfer brings to an end Hirschi’s four-year-long partnership with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>. He signed for the team at the beginning of 2021 after <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/marc-hirschi-and-team-dsm-part-ways-with-immediate-effect\" target=\"_blank\">an abrupt divorce with Team DSM</a>. Since then, Hirschi has scored some solid one-day victories, but he only made two Grand Tour appearances during his four seasons at the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Hirschi and Alaphilippe, Tudor Pro Cycling have brought in Swiss Fabian Lienhard and Austrian Marco Haller. The latter finished inside the top ten in the Olympics road race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Juliette Labous moves to FDJ-Suez</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"juliette labous\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Tornanti_cc-20240709-141736-GIRO-WMN-ST03-8515E-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Eloise Mavian/Tornati CC</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Juliette Labous, an eternal fixture in the top five of women’s Grand Tour GCs, has announced her departure from<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\"> DSM-Firmenich PostNL</a>. After riding for the German team since 2017, when Labous was just 17 years old, the French rider will move across to FDJ-Suez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labous has signed a three-year contract, which will see her through until her 29th birthday. Labous will join Demi Vollering at FDJ-Suez if we are to believe the rumours. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/evita-muzic-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Évita Muzic</a> will also provide another key card for FDJ-Suez next year. With these signings, FDJ-Suez is quickly becoming a super-team within the women’s peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘French champion and top five in the last two Tours de France [2022 and 2023], Juliette is a remarkable athlete and undeniably one of the best climbers in the professional peloton,’ says FDJ-Suez’s team’s general manager Stephen Delcourt. ‘We are also honoured by Juliette’s confidence in our project and our vision.

With this, it has been confirmed that Alberto Bettiol has received a strong offer from Astana Qazaqstan, soon to be rebranded to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/chinese-company-invests-in-astana-qazaqstan\" target=\"_blank\">XDS following the change of sponsors</a>. <em>Gazzetta Dello Sport</em> correctly reported that Bettiol would move as soon as mid-August 2024. This means he is now contracted with Astana until 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasons for this transfer seem unknown. Bettiol has been with EF on and off since the beginning of his career. He has been given leadership roles and a chance to flourish in one-day races and stage races alike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Italian jersey on his back, Astana will be glad to welcome back the <em>tricolore </em>jersey. Astana are in desperate need of some UCI points. The squad look poised for relegation if they don’t improve on their results in the next year. If this continues, the squad’s relegation would come into effect in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Cofidis reinforced with Alex Aranburu and Emu Buchmann</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"alex aranburu\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/DP2_6664.jpg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Baloise Tour of Belgium</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cofidis are in the fight for WorldTour survival as well. They are close to the relegation zone and need to change their strategy after a lacklustre season. In the quest for UCI points, the French team have enlisted Spanish sprinter Alex Aranburu and German climber Emanuel Buchmann.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aranburu’s departure from Movistar was widely reported. While at Movistar over the past three seasons, Aranburu’s results have been mixed. With this deal secured with Cofidis, he will become a core rider in the team. The Spanish rider is a great signing for gathering UCI points. Aranburu can get over small climbs and he can time-trial well.

The British rider has penned a contract with the team until 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite previous interest from Israel-Premier Tech, Dutch squad <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> won the hunt for Yates’s signature. Much like his brother <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/adam-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Adam</a> at UAE, Simon will be hoping to star in a powerful mountain train at future Tours de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike director Grischa Niermann said that Yates would provide ‘a significant boost for the general classification squad. Simon will have the opportunity to go for his own results with us, but he will also be a valuable asset for the team in the mountains.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After ten years spent at Jayco-AlUla, this will mark the end of one of cycling’s longest-running partnerships, which saw Yates claim a Vuelta a España victory and a Giro d’Italia podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Yates gone, Jayco-AlUla have announced that they will bring in Perth-born Ben O’Connor. High in confidence from a fourth-place finish at the Giro in May, O’Connor will lead Jayco-AlUla’s Tour de France hopes for at least the next two seasons. Despite his Australian nationality, O’Connor has never ridden for<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jayco-alula\" target=\"_blank\"> the GreenEdge project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with O’Connor, Paul Double, Koen Bouwman and Patrick Gamper will join the squad. All three of these riders are strong climbers. Bouwman won the <em>maglia azzurra</em> at the Giro d’Italia in 2022 while Paul Double finished in third place overall at the Tour of Turkey. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Alexey Lutsenko and Jan Hirt to Israel-Premier Tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-970x647.png\" alt=\"alexey lutsenko astana\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-14T110348.730.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A frontman for Astana Qazaqstan, Alexey Lutsenko will leave the Kazakh squad after 12 years spent with the team.

The plot has thickened to some extent. Ralf Denk’s squad is still targeting Evenepoel’s signature in 2025. However, they are against the clock to get the move done in time. It’s also believed that Specialized – who sponsor both Soudal-QuickStep and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe – could be a key stakeholder in this deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with Evenepoel, we take these rumours with a pinch of salt. QuickStep have built a team around him and team boss Patrick Lefevere seems to be supportive of Evenepoel’s grand ambitions. He would also need to sever his current contract with Soudal-QuickStep in order to move over to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe. That said, the German team has increased funds, and a much bigger budget than Evenepoel’s current squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: Caleb Ewan and Sergio Higuita to Astana</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-970x647.png\" alt=\"caleb ewan\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-30T171209.238.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Oman Cycling Association/Pauline Ballet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Astana Qazastan have been one of the more active teams in this year’s transfer market. Maybe this isn’t so surprising given the cash injection from the aforementioned Chinese investment secured by XDS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the hunt for a new blue ribbon sprinter, Astana are setting their sights on signing Caleb Ewan. The Australian is currently signed onto a Jayco-AlUla contract through to the end of 2025. Astana would, therefore, need to buy him out of the contract if he were to move to the Kazakh team. All parties – Astana, Jayco and Ewan himself – would also need to come to an agreement on the matter. If the deal does go through, this will provide some legacy for Mark Cavendish’s old sprint train.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the crosshairs for Astana is Sergio Higuita. This is considered a ‘done deal’ and we await official confirmation from Astana in the days to come. The Colombian will join a strong climbing set-up at Vinokourov’s team. In closing this deal, Higuita will wave goodbye to Bora after three seasons spent with the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: Demi Vollering and Elisa Longo Borghini expecting moves</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-970x647.png\" alt=\"demi vollering tour de france femmes 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of the top riders in women’s cycling look set for big transfers at the end of this season.

Guercilena also confirmed that Lidl-Trek tried to extend the contract of the Italian national champion, but she has decided that her future lies elsewhere. The destination has emerged to be UAE Team ADQ, although this news awaits official confirmation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March, news broke that Demi Vollering will be leaving SD Worx-Protime at the end of 2024. After a partnership that has resulted in Classics victories and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\" target=\"_blank\">a Tour de France Femmes</a> title, the Dutch champion will go elsewhere for 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s perhaps not a surprise given the increasing powers of Lotte Kopecky and return of Anna van der Breggen next season, Vollering is the biggest name in the women’s market this year and there is a fierce and exclusive battle for her signature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours were that Vollering’s agent was in serious talks with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> up until the Tour of Flanders when the American team pulled back their interest in support of their current roster’s future objectives.

For Eenkhoorn, this will mark the end of a short stint at Lotto-Dstny, and Hayter will carry the British national champion’s jersey to the Belgian team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other women’s rumours</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the women, Lotte Kopecky and Lorena Wiebes have penned hefty contract extensions until 2028. They are no longer available for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are big changes expected at Canyon-SRAM. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cecilie-uttrup-ludwig-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig</a> looks set to make the jump from FDJ-Suez to Canyon-SRAM for 2025. The potential arrival of Demi Vollering and the current rise of French climber <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/evita-muzic-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Évita Muzic</a> threaten Uttrup Ludwig’s niche within the team. Chiara Consonni, already a stage winner at the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-women-route-live-coverage-prize-money-teams\" target=\"_blank\"> Giro d’Italia Women</a>, is also linked to Canyon-SRAM. This means that Consonni will exit UAE Team ADQ before the rumoured signing of Elisa Longo Borghini comes into effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingvild Gåskjenn, a breakout star from the spring Classics, has penned a contract with Uno-X Mobility. Former world champion Amelie Dideriksen, however, is on her way out of UnoX. She will move to Cofidis in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Curious where the money for these big contracts comes from?
