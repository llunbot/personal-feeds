But a lot of people gloss over these critical elements until they encounter a noticeable problem. Even when that happens, many riders resort to guesswork, trying tons of products with different widths, shapes, and sizes until they arrive at a Goldilocks moment, or at least get close to one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SQlab, a leading industry purveyor of all things ergonomic including saddles, grips, handlebars, bar ends, pedals, and more, has worked for years to give riders the information they need to find the perfect-fitting equipment to make riding as comfortable as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2002, SQlab designed a system to measure a rider’s sit bones, which are the key contact points with the saddle, that they can use to find a saddle with the correct width. While that system used to require folks to travel to a local SQlab retailer, the brand now offers an <a href=\"https://sqlab-usa.com/collections/accessories/products/free-measure-at-home-kit?gclid=CjwKCAjwtuOlBhBREiwA7agf1m1_eCPXpNpxKOZHXP0RUo6m51zIDsKQpURmearKidqHNMAqaFajQBoCqB0QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">at-home measurement kit that can help riders measure all of their contact points with the bike, including the sit bones, hands, and feet.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-800x533.png\" alt=\"A man sitting on a chair to measure his sit bones with the SQlab home measurement kit.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93180-720x480.png 720w\" /></a><figcaption>SQlab offers its home measurement kit for free in North America and the European Union; (Photo/SQlab)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The kit includes everything a rider needs to measure each contact point. First, for the sit bone measurement, SQlab uses a piece of corrugated cardboard that riders place on a flat surface and sit on. After that, they can measure the distance between the imprint left by their sit bones to find their perfect saddle width.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the right saddle is essential for tackling longer rides. A saddle that doesn’t fit right can lead to a host of issues including back pain, knee pain, and numbness. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-800x533.png\" alt=\"A man measuring his sit bone width on a piece of cardboard provided in the SQlab home measurement kit.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93149-720x480.png 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Sit bone width is a key factor in determining the right saddle fit; (Photo/SQlab)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The measuring kit can help with common misconceptions such as a softer saddle fixing comfort issues. SQlab states extremely soft bike saddles are only recommended for rides up to 30 minutes, as they cannot offer support and damping for the sit bones. Instead, the sit bones sink into the soft material, which irritates deeper-lying, sensitive tissue, such as muscle and tendon attachments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with a good idea of your measurements can help riders avoid nagging issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-800x533.png\" alt=\"A man measuring his hand with the SQlab home measurement kit.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93099-720x480.png 720w\" /></a><figcaption>SQlab grips come in a variety of sizes to fit people with different size hands; (Photo/SQlab)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To measure the hands for the right grip, SQlab gives riders a sheet they can use to measure the distance from the tip of the middle finger to the crook of the thumb, which informs which diameter, length, and shape of grip will best suit a rider. SQlab grips come in up to four different sizes, all of which vary in length, shape, and diameter. Finding the right fit can make long rides far more comfortable, and reduce the risk of injury from being in the wrong position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-800x533.png\" alt=\"An image of SQlab's home measurement kit foot measurement sheet.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93238-720x480.png 720w\" /></a><figcaption>SQlab’s foot measurements help riders find insoles for added support and stability; (Photo/SQlab)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, SQlab includes another sheet that helps riders measure the shape of their foot, leg axis, and foot length. This measurement helps riders identify the best insole to fit the unique profile of their foot. For a sport considered by most to be “low-impact,” a rider’s feet are subjected to a ton of pressure, shock, and vibration. A reliable, stable platform at the feet tends to translate to increased comfort throughout the rest of the body, while the same is true for an unreliable and unstable platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-800x533.png\" alt=\"A man draws a line around his foot using the SQlab home measurement kit.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-2048x1366.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sqlab.vermiss.mich_.set_.2023.byRupertFowler.93201-720x480.png 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Ill-fitting saddles, shoes, and grips can lead to a wide variety of issues on the bike, including numbness and discomfort; (Photo/SQlab)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The best news about the SQlab system is that it’s free throughout North America and the European Union.
