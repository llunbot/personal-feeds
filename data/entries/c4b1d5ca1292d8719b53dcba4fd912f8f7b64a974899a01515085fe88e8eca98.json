It’ll carry up to 240lbs, or 120lbs per tray, and pops off the hitch mount in just a few seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tray sits on articulating arms with a gear shaft to raise and lower it. You can connect an electric drill to make it quick, or crank it by hand. It’ll come all the way down to the ground, so you can simply roll your bikes (or motos) onto it, then raise it for driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1467\" height=\"2033\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3.jpg\" alt=\"suweeka hitch rack with lowering tray\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3.jpg 1467w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3-216x300.jpg 216w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3-800x1109.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3-87x120.jpg 87w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3-768x1064.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-3-1108x1536.jpg 1108w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the bikes are on, a moveable arm with quick-pull straps clamps onto the frame to keep the bike secure and stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1471\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"suweeka hitch rack with lowering tray\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-297x171.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-800x460.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-120x69.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-768x441.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-1536x883.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/suweeka-hitch-bike-rack-with-lowering-tray-2-2048x1177.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also folds up when not in use, or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tray and hinge are one big unit, and the entire thing detaches without having to slide it out of your trailer hitch.
