But what happens when you install a font and Pages (or Numbers or Keynote) insists it’s not there, even if you quit the app and relaunch it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS has had strong font management for many years, due in part to Apple’s adoption of the PostScript-centric NeXT operating system as the basis of OS X. But there are still hiccups. Some internal cache that lists available fonts doesn’t seem to get the message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll know this situation when it happens:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select some text in Pages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the Format Inspector at the right edge of your document isn’t displayed, click the <em>Format</em> button (if visible) on the toolbar or choose <em>View &gt; Inspector &gt; Format</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose the <em>Font</em> menu and look for your typeface. Is it missing?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-fonts-palette-bordered.png\" alt=\"Pages Fonts\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-fonts-palette-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 894w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-fonts-palette-bordered.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-fonts-palette-bordered.png?resize=768%2C472&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"894\" height=\"550\" /><figcaption><p>Use the Fonts palette to gain access to typefaces that you’ve installed but don’t yet appear in Pages or other apps.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there’s an easy bypass built into Pages and other Apple and third-party software that lets you display the Fonts palette, such as <em>Format &gt; Font &gt; Show Fonts</em> in Pages. In the Fonts palette, you see a list of all installed typefaces for your logged-in user or all users on the Mac under the Typeface list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to select a font you don’t see in Pages:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the Fonts palette isn’t showing, press Command-T or choose <em>Format &gt; Font &gt; Show Fonts</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Under the Typeface list, select the typeface you desire.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check that in Pages, the Fonts menu in the Format Inspector shows the typeface you selected.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
