That’s when she saw it: a fossil lying there, exposed on the surface. Most people would not have recognized it for what it was: It wasn’t a skull, a leg bone, or even a partial jaw. It was just a chunk of bone.</p>\n<p>Shepherd immediately notified a park ranger. That ranger then notified the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Her actions ultimately led to the discovery of what scientists say is not only a new species, but an entirely new genus of mosasaur, a giant marine predator from Late Cretaceous seas. Bite marks preserved on the fossil also suggest that it met its end at the hands—or rather teeth—of another mosasaur.</p>\n<h2>Meet Jorgie the mosasaur</h2>\n<p>The new mosasaur <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.amnh.org/items/ed0b57e3-8134-4a1a-a0b9-02c7a8c19bfd\">was described</a> Monday in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History. <i>Jǫrmungandr walhallaensis</i>, or \"Jorgie\" for short, is the name suggested by co-author Clint Boyd, and it’s steeped in Norse mythology. Jǫrmungandr is the name of a sea serpent who circles the world with its body, clasping its tail in its jaws.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979840#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979840&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeanne Timmons","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f710a4c5d64e328ad5a7aafb9d53ab54ccf64efa7b1d5d8bbf22292c1c7e28b8","category":"Tech"}
