Still, Zuckerberg's short review included its fair share of fair points, alongside some careful turns of phrase that obscure the Quest's relative deficiencies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3TkhmivNzt/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003724#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003724&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb6d9282b7288c3271e198745701ed57388250c9388e1a6540eeec417ba16e59","category":"Tech"}
