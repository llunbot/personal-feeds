{"title":"The Vice President Should Not Be Using Bluetooth Headphones","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822431/kamala-harris-bluetooth-security-hacking-headphones","date":1639100171000,"content":"\n<p>Corin Faife, writing for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But in certain cases this can be skirted, as with one exploit that\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-devices-vulnerable-short-range-bluetooth-exploit\">impersonates a trusted Bluetooth device</a> already known to the\nuser in order to connect to the phone, at which point the attacker\ncan request or send data via Bluetooth. (The complexity of this\nattack makes it unlikely to affect regular people, but for a\nfigure like the VP — who is undeniably a high-value target for\nforeign surveillance attempts — there’s a non-zero chance of\nfalling victim. It also affects both Android and Apple devices,\nthe latter of which Harris appears to use.) [...]</p>\n\n<p>In total, the CVE Program, which tracks cybersecurity\nvulnerabilities, lists <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=bluetooth\">459 current and historic vulnerabilities\nthat mention Bluetooth</a>, suggesting that Kamala Harris is\nright to be wary. There’s a simple way to mitigate all of these\nattacks — disabling Bluetooth, sticking to wired headphones — but doing so means swimming against the technological current, and\nmaybe looking like you can’t afford AirPods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Put another way, if Kamala Harris used wireless headphones, there is a chance — almost certainly a very small chance, but, we don’t know — that it could be taken advantage of by an adversary. If she uses wired headphones (and, presumably, disables Bluetooth on her iPhone), there’s <em>no chance</em> her phone can be exploited by a Bluetooth vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlennF/status/1468642611141382148\">Glenn Fleishman, on Twitter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>@gruber Your note on the Harris/Bluetooth thing: most zero-days\nare now held closely by government and criminals. So there may be\nBluetooth zero-days that are used very sparingly and haven’t yet\nbeen discovered. Harris’s time on the Senate Intelligence\nCommittee might be a clue!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What we don’t know, she might.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/09/verge-harris-bluetooth\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc96329a6b37b9432cc776f6becf58de665f287b58eadddff36052d14ce81534","category":"Tech"}
