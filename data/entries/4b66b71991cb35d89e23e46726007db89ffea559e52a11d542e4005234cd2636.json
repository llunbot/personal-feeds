{"title":"VisionOS 2.2 brings long-awaited Mac Virtual Display upgrade","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2553840/visionos-2-2-brings-long-awaited-mac-virtual-display-upgrade.html","date":1733949898000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest visionOS 2.2 update doesn’t add much. Compared to iOS/iPadOS 18.2 with its numerous Apple Intelligence features, the updates in visionOS 2.2 seem positively threadbare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you have one, you should upgrade right away, as there is one new feature we’ve been waiting for since it was first announced: Support for wide and ultrawide resolutions when using Mac Virtual Display. Since Mac Virtual Display <em>replaces</em> your Mac’s output with the floating display in VR space, the feature in its original form didn’t offer much benefit other than being larger than your Mac’s original display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With support for wide and ultrawide formats, however, the feature can now actually add significant new screen real estate compared to the built-in display on your Macbook or standard monitor hooked up to a desktop Mac. As Apple says, it’s like working on two 5K monitors side by side.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>VisionOS 2.2: Release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are Apple’s release notes for visionOS 2.2:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mac Virtual Display</strong><br />– Use Mac apps and games with a new aspect ratio: wide (21:9) and ultrawide (32:9) – the equivalent of two 5K monitors side by side<br />– Route audio from your Mac to Apple Vision Pro</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple TV</strong><br />– Watch up to five MLS and MLB games at once with Multiview<br />– Watch live sporting events together with SharePlay</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safari</strong><br />– Tap to view spatial photos and videos embedded on web pages</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>visionOS 2.2: How to update your Apple Vision Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If an update is available, tap <em>Download and Install</em> or <em>Install Now</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the update is ready to install, an alert asks you to take off your Apple Vision Pro.
