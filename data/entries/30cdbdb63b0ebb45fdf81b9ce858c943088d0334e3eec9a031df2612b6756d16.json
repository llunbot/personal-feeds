And you’d be right. But that didn’t stop Litespeed from seeking out a way to build a lighter, higher performing, more durable frame. They claim that nothing was off the table, from 3D printing, to different assembly techniques. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they found was… nothing. Nothing that would deliver a marked improvement on their existing strength-to-weight ratios, durability, or performance of their current proprietary processes. According to Litespeed, their tubing shaping and CNC machining of small titanium parts still reigns supreme. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"952\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-Large.webp\" alt=\"Coll dels Reis Frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-Large-297x221.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-Large-120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-Large-768x571.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photos/Litespeed)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Coll dels Reis really became a passion project for us,” said Litespeed’s Brad DeVaney. “We are constantly testing every titanium manufacturing method, even 3D printing. Interestingly, we found new technology and techniques didn’t always guarantee strength-to-weight improvements. With no room to compromise on weight, we carefully evaluated every piece of this bike for strength and function, and chose proprietary methods that we’ve developed over years to produce the lightest weights and most reliable results.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that didn’t stop them from taking their production to the next level. With their sights set on the title of the “world’s lightest production titanium road frame,” they set out to create their newest model – the Coll dels Reis. Named for the legendary climb in Mallorca, the Coll dels Reis is a climbing bike at heart, but still has clearance for 35mm tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-10.28.01 AM.png\"><img width=\"809\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-10.28.01 AM.png\" alt=\"Litespeed Coll dels Reis weights\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-10.28.01 AM.png 809w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-10.28.01 AM-297x261.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-10.28.01 AM-120x106.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-10.28.01 AM-768x676.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large.webp\" alt=\"Coll dels Reis Frame DT-ST-BB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Frame-DT-ST-BB-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large.webp\" alt=\"Coll dels Reis TopTube-HeadTube Detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-TopTube-HeadTube-Detail-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just how light is it? When built with a BSA threaded bottom bracket, Litespeed SL Ti dropouts, and an anodized head tube graphic, the frame comes in at 948g for a medium. According to the competitor numbers provided by Litespeed, the closest competition comes from the 1,180g Seven Cycles Axiom XX. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer a more modern build, you can add a T47i threaded bottom bracket and a UDH dropout which then tips the scales at 1,049g. Still plenty light. Heavier riders should take note, the Coll dels Reis does have an 85 kg/187 lb rider weight limit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Showcase-Profile-White-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"890\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Showcase-Profile-White-Large.webp\" alt=\"Coll dels Reis Showcase Profile White\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Showcase-Profile-White-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Showcase-Profile-White-Large-297x207.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Showcase-Profile-White-Large-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Coll-dels-Reis-Showcase-Profile-White-Large-768x534.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Complete bikes are outfitted with your choice of Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 or SRAM RED AXS, and ENVE SES 2.3, SES 4.5, or Zipp 353 NSW wheelsets.
