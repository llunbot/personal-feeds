The breakthrough rocked confidence in Silicon Valley’s AI leadership, leading Wall Street investors to wipe billions of dollars of value from US Big Tech stocks.</p>\n<p>Through distillation, companies take a large language model—dubbed a “teacher” model—which generates the next likely word in a sentence. The teacher model generates data which then trains a smaller “student” model, helping to quickly transfer knowledge and predictions of the bigger model to the smaller one.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-firms-follow-deepseeks-lead-create-cheaper-models-with-distillation/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-firms-follow-deepseeks-lead-create-cheaper-models-with-distillation/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Cristina Criddle and Melissa Heikkilä, Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c425cb3386bf7b59b7d96e36c6be9872279778e7e2a1ea05a8dc36995cbe21e0","category":"Tech"}
