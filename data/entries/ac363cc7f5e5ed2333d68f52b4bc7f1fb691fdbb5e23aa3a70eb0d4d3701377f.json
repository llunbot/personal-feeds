It also added language support for over 40 languages.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, Bard's new \"double-check button\" has been designed to provide a counter against <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/\">confabulations</a> where Bard produces inaccurate information or makes things up (a concept often called \"hallucinations\" in the AI field). It's a public admission that Bard often lacks accuracy and isn't a dependable factual reference. Here's how Google describes it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Starting today with responses in English, you can use Bard’s “Google it” button to more easily double-check its answers. When you click on the “G” icon, Bard will read the response and evaluate whether there is content across the web to substantiate it. When a statement can be evaluated, you can click the highlighted phrases and learn more about supporting or contradicting information found by Search.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To use the double-check feature, users can click a small \"G\" logo below Bard's results. Bard will search the web and highlight sentences in its output that match affirmatively with a green highlight. Bard statements that contradict Google Search results get a peach-colored highlight. From our experiments, the double-check button reinforced some statements but did not always catch logical flaws in its output.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969226#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969226&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ac363cc7f5e5ed2333d68f52b4bc7f1fb691fdbb5e23aa3a70eb0d4d3701377f","category":"Tech"}
