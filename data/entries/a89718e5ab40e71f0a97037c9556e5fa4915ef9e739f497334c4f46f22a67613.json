The smaller iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max are limited to up to 3x optical zoom.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard iPhone 16 offers up to 2x optical-quality zoom, so the iPhone 17 should too at a minimum. However, zoom specifications for the iPhone 17 Air are still unclear, as the device is rumored to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">only a single 48-megapixel rear camera</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 17 Air rumors have been a mixed bag so far. The device could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/iphone-17-air-could-be-thinnest-iphone-ever/\">become the thinnest iPhone ever</a>, but some of its specifications will seemingly be lacking compared to the Pro models, which will make for a tough purchasing decision. In other words, if you want the cool new iPhone with the thin, new design, there will be tradeoffs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been conflicting rumors about the iPhone 17 Air's design and specifications, but most sources have agreed that it will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">around a 6.6-inch display</a>. In July, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">said</a> he expects the device to have a standard A19 chip, a Dynamic Island, a single rear camera, and an Apple-designed 5G modem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat means the iPhone 17 Air would have quite a large display, but the 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max would still be larger. With an A19 chip, the device would certainly be performant, but the iPhone 17 Pro models will get a superior A19 Pro chip. A single camera would put the device on the same tier as the iPhone SE for photography.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air could be one of the first devices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">with an Apple-designed 5G modem</a>, but it is unclear if it will have any obvious consumer benefits over the Qualcomm modems that are expected to be used for iPhone 17 Pro models. Nevertheless, Apple's cellular future will debut in this device rather than the flagship Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's still early, so we should learn a lot more about the iPhone 17 Air over the coming months.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/iphone-17-and-17-air-said-to-lack-5x-optical-zoom/\">iPhone 17 and 'iPhone 17 Air' Expected to Lack 5x Optical Zoom Lens</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-and-iphone-17-air-expected-to-lack-5x-optical-zoom-lens.2443743/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a89718e5ab40e71f0a97037c9556e5fa4915ef9e739f497334c4f46f22a67613","category":"Apple"}
