{"title":"AltStore Pal Now Free Thanks to 'MegaGrant' From Epic Games","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/altstore-pal-now-free-epic-games/","date":1723726647000,"content":"<a href=\"https://altstore.io/\">AltStore PAL</a>, the open-source app that is designed to distribute apps in the EU from independent developers, is now free thanks to a grant provided by <em>Fortnite</em> developer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/altstore-pal-eu.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe alternative iOS app store had charged a â‚¬1.50 plus tax annual subscription, in order to cover Apple's Core Technology Fee (CTF). Apple's terms for alternative app marketplaces requires developers to pay the CTF for each annual app installation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, AltStore Pal will no longer pass on the cost of this fee after the third-party store received a \"<a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants\">MegaGrant</a>\" from â€ŒEpic Gamesâ€Œ. <a href=\"https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826482046886273\">AltStore said</a> that existing subscribers won't be charged upon their renewal date, and that the AltStore team plans to \"show our appreciation for our existing subscribers in a future update,\" but didn't go into details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDeveloper Riley Testut has been working on AltStore PAL since Apple announced plans to support alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4. It is open to all apps, but Testut says that it makes the most sense for \"smaller, indie apps that otherwise couldn't exist due to â€Œ<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>â€Œ rules.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAltStore PAL is equipped with Patreon integration to allow developers to monetize their apps. Developers can offer their apps to just their patrons, and this method of distribution also allows for a sub-1 million cap on those who can subscribe to use an app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>GOOD NEWS EU ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º For innovation in app distribution, Epic Games has granted us a MegaGrant grant that we plan to use to cover Appleâ€™s Core Technology Fee going forward â€” and we wonâ€™t take it for granted!<br /><br />What does this mean? AltStore PAL is now FREE â€” no subscription necessary ðŸŽ‰ <a href=\"https://t.co/JSJo3FdhBx\">pic.twitter.com/JSJo3FdhBx</a></p>â€” AltStore.io (@altstoreio) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users in the European Union can download AltStore PAL from the AltStore website. Alternative app marketplaces are not available outside of the European Union.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for Epic, it has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/fortnite-epic-game-store-submitted-apple/\">submitted</a> the â€ŒEpic Gamesâ€Œ Store to Apple for notarization under Apple's alternative app marketplace policy in the European Union. The â€Œâ€ŒEpic Gamesâ€Œâ€Œ Store will include <em>Fortnite</em>, which means â€Œâ€ŒiPhoneâ€Œâ€Œ users in the EU will be able to install and play the title without having to use a cloud gaming service. An â€Œ<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>â€Œ version of Fortnite is expected to follow this year.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/altstore-pal-now-free-epic-games/\">AltStore Pal Now Free Thanks to 'MegaGrant' From Epic Games</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/altstore-pal-now-free-thanks-to-megagrant-from-epic-games.2433686/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae0d653e3777449cd7568e444be35b774dd6e6972e4b3b6dbab03b118f8d8f75","category":"Apple"}
