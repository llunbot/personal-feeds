Williamson, a researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. For a long time, neuroscientists thought that the storage of memory in the brain was the job of engrams, ensembles of neurons that activate during a learning event. But it turned out this wasn’t the whole picture.</p>\n<p>Williamson’s research investigated the role astrocytes, non-neuron brain cells, play in the read-and-write operations that go on in our heads. “Over the last 20 years the role of astrocytes has been understood better. We’ve learned that they can activate neurons. The addition we have made to that is showing that there are subsets of astrocytes that are active and involved in storing specific memories,” Williamson says in describing a new study his lab has published.</p>\n<p>One consequence of this finding: Astrocytes could be artificially manipulated to suppress or enhance a specific memory, leaving all other memories intact.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/tweaking-non-neural-brain-cells-can-cause-memories-to-fade/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/tweaking-non-neural-brain-cells-can-cause-memories-to-fade/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5340c7101367f5e9e59175edaab253777e24017071bc6c09b40b3512919ac8d","category":"Tech"}
