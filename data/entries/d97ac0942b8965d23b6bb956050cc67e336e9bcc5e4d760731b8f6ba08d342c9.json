The sensors in the Apple Watch are able to detect the fine movements, registering it as a tap on the display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Double Tap gesture can be used to perform single-tap actions such as answering or ending a phone call, stopping a timer, playing and pausing music, snoozing or turning off an alarm, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause Double Tap is enabled through the S9 chip in the ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ and Apple Watch Ultra, it is a feature that is limited to these models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135\">Apple Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/watchos-10-1-double-tap-support/\">watchOS 10.1 Beta 2 Adds Support for Double Tap</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-2-adds-support-for-double-tap.2406141/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d97ac0942b8965d23b6bb956050cc67e336e9bcc5e4d760731b8f6ba08d342c9","category":"Apple"}
