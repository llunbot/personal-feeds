In the past few months, the creator of the Powershift two-speed hub <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/international/2022/11/30/drivetrain-maker-classified-cycling-raises-24-million\">received $22.9 million</a> from lead investor Active Partners and became part of the setup of choice for Victor Campenaerts’ Ridley Noah road bike on the WorldTour. The brand’s latest move is a partnership with HUNT wheels, and by extension, Mason Cycles. </span></p>\n<p><span>Hunt will start its Classified partnership with two different wheel options: the 48 Limitless Aero Disc wheels and the 40 Carbon Gravel Race wheels. Perhaps tellingly for Classified’s current ambitions, both of these wheels are performance-oriented and optimized to be as quick as possible. Both wheels will maintain the standard HUNT FEA-developed front hubs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Read also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/trailblazer-marianne-martin/\">Trailblazer: Marianne Martin</a></p>\n<p><span>Our previous long-term review proved the </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2021/06/hunt-48-limitless-aero-disc-road-wheelset-review-wide-and-stable/\"><span>HUNT 48 Limitless Aero Disc</span></a><span> wheels offer a ton of speed and stability without a huge asking price.

Expect to pay US $1349 / €1499 / £1149 and US $1199 / €1239 / £949 respectively for the Classified-equipped wheels, or the same as the standard versions of these wheels.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hunt-Bike-Wheels-3353-1340x894.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"HUNT 48 Limitless Aero wheel with Classified hub | CyclingTips\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" /><figcaption><span>A Classified x HUNT 48 Limitless Aero Disc wheel with a two-speed mechanism, Classified cassette, and thru-axle transmitter.

(Photo: HUNT Bike Wheels)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Interestingly, both the 48 Limitless and 40 Carbon Gravel wheels are roughly 100 grams lighter than their traditional hub counterparts. Don’t let that number make you think your Classified-equipped bike will be lighter than a traditional 2x drivetrain, as the remaining Classified hardware adds about 500 grams. Both Classified and HUNT say you are no worse off when calculating your bike’s weight against a double chainring and front derailleur.</span></p>\n<p><span>Long-time HUNT partner Mason Cycles will also get into the action by offering Classified Powershift across its entire range of bikes using the aforementioned HUNT wheels. </span></p>\n<p><span>This latest partnership is part of a slew of </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2022/07/classified-partners-with-leading-wheel-brands-for-its-powershift-hub/\"><span>current partnerships for Classified</span></a><span> with wheels brands like ENVE, FFWD, Reynolds, Boyd, and others. Classified Cycling, established in 2019, anticipates these partnerships — both with wheel manufacturers and bicycle manufacturers alike — will accelerate the acceptance of their Powershift drivetrain system. </span></p>\n<p><span>Like other Classified-equipped wheels, the HUNT rear wheels are built around the unique Classified rear hub shell, which hides a swappable two-speed gearbox designed to replace the front derailleur. Classified claims the system provides the effective gearing of a double chainring setup but maintains the clean lines of a single chainring crankset. These are paired to a Classified thru axle designed as a halfway point of communication between the internal hub and bar-mounted handlebar transmitter. The result is a uniquely slick and innovative system. </span></p>\n<p><span>We’re excited to get out on HUNT wheels with a Classified Powershift system for an in-depth review.

Just above that on the inside of the handlebar is a bump, presumably for the Classified Powershift shifter.
