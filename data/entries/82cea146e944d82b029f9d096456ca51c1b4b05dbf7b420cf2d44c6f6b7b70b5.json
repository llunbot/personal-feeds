There are already multiple iPhone web browsers with AI tools, such as Microsoft Edge with a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/how-to-use-copilot-in-edge-on-your-phone?form=MA13I2\">GPT-4-powered Copilot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/arc-search-iphone-app-ai/\">Arc Search</a>, which can summarize web pages to provide concise information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nÁlvarez also uncovered a so-called \"Encrypted Visual Search\" feature in the backend code on Apple's servers, but no specific details are known. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser last year discovered a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/vision-pro-visual-search-feature/\">new Visual Search feature for Apple's Vision Pro headset</a> in visionOS beta code, which would allow users to copy and paste printed text from the real world into apps and more, but the feature has yet to launch. It is possible that Apple is planning to debut a more secure version of the feature. However, the code could also relate to the iPhone's existing Visual Look Up feature that can identify objects in photos and videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is set to unveil iOS 18 during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/\">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, so we should learn more about these potential new features in a few more months.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/\">iOS 18 May Feature All-New 'Safari Browsing Assistant'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-may-feature-all-new-safari-browsing-assistant.2423930/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82cea146e944d82b029f9d096456ca51c1b4b05dbf7b420cf2d44c6f6b7b70b5","category":"Apple"}
