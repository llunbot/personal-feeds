A real deal\" reads a part of the advertisement that Jobs wrote out. Jobs' signature is included, and the address listed is his parents' house, which is where Apple started out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe handwritten draft matches the original advertisement for the Apple-1, with the first ad published in the July 1976 edition of Interface Magazine. The ad is accompanied by two Polaroid photos of Apple-1 machines taken at The Byte Shop in Mountain View, California. Jobs annotated one of the images, noting that it was \"fuzzy because camera wiggled.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ad copy was put up for sale by a close friend of Steve Jobs that was present during the Apple-1's developmental phase. He was gifted the items as cherished keepsakes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/apple-1-computer-domain.jpg\" alt width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" />\r<br />\nSeparately, an operational Apple-1 Computer signed by Steve Wozniak sold for $223,520, and a 1976 Apple Computer check signed by Jobs and Wozniak sold for $135,261.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-1/\">Apple-1</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/apple-ad-steve-jobs-175k/\">Apple-1 Ad Handwritten by Steve Jobs Sells for Over $175,000</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-1-ad-handwritten-by-steve-jobs-sells-for-over-175-000.2399646/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d074ce193717b8fb1903246101fbead02e88116511766093f7e1ceee5d7832be","category":"Apple"}
