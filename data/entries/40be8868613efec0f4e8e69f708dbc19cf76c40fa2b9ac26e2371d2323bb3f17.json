Critics argue that means that new power plants or factories can be developed in Montana without considering climate impacts.</p>\n<p>A victory for the young plaintiffs could potentially set important legal precedent for how courts can hold states accountable for climate inaction. The trial will take place over the next two weeks, ending on June 23. It will soon be followed by similar challenges by young people in other states, including Oregon and Hawaii.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947549#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947549&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"40be8868613efec0f4e8e69f708dbc19cf76c40fa2b9ac26e2371d2323bb3f17","category":"Tech"}
