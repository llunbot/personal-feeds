Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Google and others have launched gaming services that run from the cloud. That allows support for a wider range of games and creates a \"Netflix for games\"-like experience. Oddly, Apple doesn't allow those rivals to join Apple Arcade on the App Store. The company says that's not because they're competitors, but simply because it doesn't allow all-you-can-eat cloud gaming services on its devices. Despite that, <strong>the company in the past has internally discussed the prospects of launching such a service</strong>, I'm told. I just hope that if Apple does, it then greenlights its rivals' participation too.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThus far, Apple has focused on games that have to be downloaded and run natively, rather than games that stream from the cloud. The company launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>‌‌ in September of 2019 as an ad-free mobile game subscription service with no in-app purchases. ‌‌‌Apple Arcade‌‌‌ is available across the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/\">iPod touch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, and Mac for $4.99 per month, or as part of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a> bundle.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne explanation for why Apple has not moved forward with cloud gaming as far as we know may be because it seems to prefer using powerful local hardware rather than depending on an internet connection to stream games being processed elsewhere. It also seems unlikely that the company would risk an obligation to allow competing cloud gaming services by Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/netflix-mobile-gaming-service/\">Netflix</a> onto the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, which have otherwise <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/11/apple-updates-app-store-review-guidelines/\">been forced</a> to use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/xbox-cloud-gaming-service-ios-launch/\">browser-based solutions</a>. Nevertheless, the company may have been sensitive to the growing interest in cloud gaming from its rivals. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-considered-launching-cloud-gaming-service/\">Apple Considered Launching Cloud Gaming Service</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considered-launching-cloud-gaming-service.2317492/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VWKz4e6Fmdo:otEl5fkGaIc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VWKz4e6Fmdo:otEl5fkGaIc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VWKz4e6Fmdo\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a26becc89b0af5ca47ba4a17cc69b832333c03e19922cff33f639e851fecad43","category":"Apple"}
