The Beats Fit Pro and ‌Powerbeats Pro‌ now feature firmware version 5B66, up from the prior 5B55 firmware that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/08/apple-power-beats-pro-beats-studio-buds-firmware/\">came out in November 2022</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/beats-fit-pro-feb23-open.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple does not offer information on what's included in refreshed firmware updates for the Beats Fit Pro and ‌Powerbeats Pro‌, so we don't know what improvements or bug fixes the firmware brings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's no standard way to upgrade the ‌Beats‌‌ software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the earbuds are connected to an iOS device. Putting the Beats‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting them to a power source, and then pairing them‌‌‌‌‌ to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> should force the update after a short period of time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf we find notable changes after the firmware update is installed, we'll share details, but the software likely includes performance improvements and bug fixes rather than outward-facing changes.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/beats-fit-pro-powerbeats-pro-firmware-update/\">Apple Releases New Firmware for Beats Fit Pro and Powerbeats Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-beats-fit-pro-and-powerbeats-pro.2388467/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"68c53c0b933397784a1ce16727029cd8032fa1b5ec0dd1a9ff89bf54c5cb4ecc","category":"Apple"}
