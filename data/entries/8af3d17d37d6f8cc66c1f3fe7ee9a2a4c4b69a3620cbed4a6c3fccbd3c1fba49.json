The device features an all-new operating system that features a three dimensional interface. Experiences in Vision Pro aren't constrained to the boundaries of a display, users can make apps any scale, and place apps wherever they wish. Environments extend beyond your physical space, and control how immersed you are by turning the digital crown. Apple says that it marks the beginning of \"spatial computing.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA Home view floats in the world in front of you to feel \"truly present\" in your room. Users use a combination of their eyes, hands, and voice to control the device. It uses eye tracking, and finger tapping and flicking to scroll or select. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headset features passthrough video of a wearer's eyes in a feature that Apple calls \"EyeSight,\" showing different feedback to surrounding people about what you are viewing inside the headset. It uses a lenticular OLED display to show the correct perspective to anyone viewing the wearer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro also allows users to connect to their Mac and expand its display in a virtual space, including alongside apps running on Vision Pro itself.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> on Vision Pro can display life-sized individuals over video calls. There is an optimized experience for viewing photos and videos. Vision Pro is also \"Apple's first 3D camera,\" showing depth in video with Spatial Audio. The headset features a cinematic video viewing experience to scale the screen beyond the dimensions of your room. Users can create a Digital Persona to use during video calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney promoted themed experiences for sports, Star Wars, Marvel,  National Geographic, and more with Apple's Reality Pro headset. Disney+ will be available for the headset upon the device's launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe entire front of the headset is made of polished glass that flows into a lightweight aluminum frame. The top of the headset features a button and a Digital Crown. It has a modular system to achieve an optimal fit. The sides of the headset feature audiopods. Those who wear glasses must use magnetic prescription glass inserts. The headset's battery is separate and links via a magnetic connection to the side of the headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headset features a microOLED Apple silicon backplane and has 23 million pixels across two display panels. 4K video can be rendered at full resolution.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro features a new Spatial Audio system provides ambient sound. It can match the sound to an environment using audio ray-tracing. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headset contains the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip paired with a new \"R1\" chip, dedicated toward real-time sensor processing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> apps can run in visionOS to provide a large number of apps upon the device's launch. It will feature a brand new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> to discover apps built for visionOS as well as compatible ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ apps. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOptic ID uses a wearer's iris to authenticate users and unlock the Vision Pro headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's Vision Pro starts at $3,499 and it will be available early next year. It will be available in Apple retail stores in the U.S. only.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-reveals-vision-pro-headset/\">Apple Reveals 'Vision Pro' Headset and visionOS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reveals-vision-pro-headset-and-visionos.2391644/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8af3d17d37d6f8cc66c1f3fe7ee9a2a4c4b69a3620cbed4a6c3fccbd3c1fba49","category":"Apple"}
