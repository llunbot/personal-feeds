Pricing will start at £8,499.</p>\n<h2>Why has Audi made an electric bicycle?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Audi is committed to “sustainable premium mobility”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Audi</i></span></div>\n<p>Like many car brands, Audi is beginning to take the electric car market seriously. It announced last year that, as of 2026, it will launch solely electric cars onto the global market, gradually phasing out combustion models by 2033.</p>\n<p>Audi says it delivered more than 100,000 electric cars to customers in 2022, a 44 per cent increase over the previous 12 months.</p>\n<p>Audi UK director Andrew Doyle frames the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike</a> through the lens of Audi’s commitment to “sustainable premium mobility”.</p>\n<p>“The Audi electric mountain bike [produced] in cooperation with Fantic is another fantastic example of how we can expand our mobility offering to customers that extends beyond the award-winning models they drive,” says Doyle.</p>\n<p>Electric bicycles are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/cycling-environmental-impact/\">arguably the greenest mode of transport</a> and are far greener than electric cars when you take into account the lifecycle emissions and the extracted materials – particularly the lithium used in batteries – required to make and power each type of electric vehicle.</p>\n<h2>Enduro inspiration</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The electric bike has 180mm of suspension travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Audi</i></span></div>\n<p>Audi’s new bike is best categorised as an electric <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro mountain bike</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension</a> comes in the form of an Öhlins shock and fork with 180mm of travel, which lives up to the enduro mountain bike potential.</p>\n<p>However, Audi says the bike is suitable for gravity riding and touring, too.</p>\n<p>Audi says the bike’s geometry is relaxed, though it hasn’t supplied specific figures.</p>\n<h2>Brose motor and Fantic battery</h2>\n<p>The Audi mountain bike features a  Fantic 720Wh battery, which is integrated into the frame. This powers a Brose S-Mag 36 Volt 250 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motor</a> with 90Nm of torque.</p>\n<p>The bike provides four levels of assistance: Eco, Tour, Sport and Boost.</p>\n<p>Audi says Eco is calibrated to deliver maximum efficiency and range, while Tour provides a ‘notable’ boost.</p>\n<p>Sport is calibrated for sport cycling, which presumably means use beyond commuting and leisure riding, while Boost delivers the maximum amount of assistance for hilly routes, according to Audi.</p>\n<p>There is a digital display on the handlebar, which shows data such as speed and battery level.</p>\n\n<h2>SRAM, Renthal and Mavic components</h2>\n<p>Audi has specced its electric mountain bike with a range of components from the likes of SRAM, Renthal and Mavic.</p>\n<p>The bike has a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-gx-eagle-12-speed-drivetrain-review/\">SRAM GX Eagle</a> drivetrain with a 34-tooth front chainring and an 11-51-tooth SunRace cassette.</p>\n<p>It uses a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet wheel setup</a> with tubeless-ready Mavic E-DEEMAX mountain bike wheels. It rolls on a Vittoria e-Mazza front tyre and e-Martello rear tyre.</p>\n<p>There are In.CA.S <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">mountain bike disc brakes</a> with a 220mm front rotor and 203mm rear rotor.</p>\n<p>The 800mm bar and 40mm stem are courtesy of Renthal and the mountain bike grips are from Switch. There is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> with a Selle Italia Novus Boost EVO saddle.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"253a54fc56214c57402f0ed1564ae347c99acc16f006c065266062","category":"Cycling"}
