designed to protect your drivetrain from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-check-your-bikes-chain-for-wear-and-stretch\" target=\"_blank\">wear</a>, decrease friction and reduce the chances of corrosion, but they differ in how easy they are to apply, the conditions in which they work best and the longevity of protection offered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest to apply are drip chain lubes, although they may need more frequent cleaning and reapplication and are easily washed off your chain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking your chain in a bath of wax may offer increased longevity and lower the tendency to attract dirt, but at the expense of more pre-prep and more bits and bobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drip wax lubes promise a middle ground, although you still need to be more careful about preparation than with standard lubes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it all sounds like too much work, you can always buy a pre-treated chain, though that will still require maintenance eventually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for our breakdown of the different types of chain lube available, the pros and cons of each and some suggestions of products to try.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

For summer use, a dry lubricant is traditionally the preferred option. Lighter than a wet lube, it consists of a wax lubricant mixed into a solvent carrier fluid. It’s quick to apply and also stays cleaner for longer. Although applied in liquid form, the idea is that the solvent allows it to penetrate your chain links. It then evaporates to leave the ingredients that do the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside of a dry lube is that it’s easily washed off by wet weather and when you <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/clean-bike-quickly\" target=\"_blank\">clean your bike</a>, so you need to apply it regularly and it doesn’t pass muster once the weather turns bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dry lube options</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>White Lightning Clean Ride </h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"White Lightning Clean Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/While-Lightning-Clean-ride.jpeg 1033w\" /><figcaption>White Lightning </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>White Lightning’s formulation dries to a waxy finish, which doesn’t tend to attract dirt, making it a good option for dusty conditions.

It’s been reformulated to remove the previous PTFE forever chemical component, replacing it with boron nitride and non-stick ceramics.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wet lubes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A wet lube is the poor weather alternative to a dry lube. It’s a good option for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/the-dos-and-donts-of-winter-bike-maintenance\" target=\"_blank\">winter riding</a> and also for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a> that may be ridden somewhere dirty. As an oil, it doesn’t dry out but stays liquid on your chain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will withstand rain and cleaning better than a dry lube, but it’s heavier and will also pick up dirt and become gunky. This means that regular chain cleaning and reapplication are needed to keep your chain running well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more viscous consistency than dry lube also means that there may be a bit more friction in your drivetrain – maybe not such a problem for a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-road-bikes-what-makes-a-good-winter-bike\" target=\"_blank\">winter road bike</a>, but not so good if you’re looking for the best possible performance on your race bike or time trial bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wet lube options</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Muc-Off C3 Wet Weather Ceramic Lube</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-970x695.jpg\" alt=\"Muc-Off C3 Wet Weather Ceramic Lube\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-970x695.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-300x215.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-768x551.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-350x250.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-750x538.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000-190x136.jpg 190w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Wet-Lube-x5_b7e73311-aa68-4536-9e07-57517c88823e_1000x1000.jpg 1000w\" /><figcaption>Muc-Off</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Muc-Off says that its Wet Weather Ceramic Lube’s ceramic particles help to protect your chain in wet and muddy conditions.

You can do this in a slow cooker or sealed in a bag and immersed in hot water. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stir the chain around then fish it out and hang it over the pot to allow the wax to cool. Finally wipe off the excess, if that’s possible, and break the hardened wax layer between the links. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage is that the wax will penetrate deep into your chain’s links, lowering friction and the risk of contamination. The wax coating also tends to be durable and less prone to collecting dirt than oil-based lubes. Formulations include low friction lubricant additives such as molybdenum disulphide, tungsten disulphide, graphene, or ‘secret sauce’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You usually need to start with a new chain and degrease it thoroughly before waxing though, or the wax won’t penetrate and stick to your chain. This adds multiple steps to the process, involves using solvents and may require soaking the chain overnight, although there are more environmentally friendly degreasing options. Some brands advise using an ultrasonic cleaner to help the process, although this may not be essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Enigma chain wax\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/61NzbFj5ljL._SL1080_.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption>Select Cycling Products</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to protect yourself from the hot wax too, to avoid burns, so use tongs or another implement to hold the chain and wear insulated gloves and eye protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to get your wax to the specified temperature for waxing to be effective, so you may need a thermometer. You’re going to have a pan of wax sitting around, so you need somewhere to keep it out of the way between uses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s likely that you’ll need to wax your chain periodically, which means removing it from the bike and redipping it. This should help to keep it clean too, so the degreasing that’s needed with a lubed chain is avoided. You’ll probably need to use a new chain <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-use-chain-quick-links\" target=\"_blank\">quick link</a> each time though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Immersion wax options</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>AbsoluteBlack GraphenLube V2</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/absluteblack-graphenwax-graphene-hot-melt-wax-lubricant-2-970x594.jpg\" alt=\"AbsoluteBlack GraphenLube V2\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/absluteblack-graphenwax-graphene-hot-melt-wax-lubricant-2-970x594.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/absluteblack-graphenwax-graphene-hot-melt-wax-lubricant-2-300x184.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/absluteblack-graphenwax-graphene-hot-melt-wax-lubricant-2-768x470.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/absluteblack-graphenwax-graphene-hot-melt-wax-lubricant-2-750x459.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/absluteblack-graphenwax-graphene-hot-melt-wax-lubricant-2-1140x698.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/absluteblack-graphenwax-graphene-hot-melt-wax-lubricant-2.jpg 1209w\" /><figcaption>AbsoluteBlack</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>AbsoluteBlack’s patented wax includes graphene as a low friction additive.

This is generally a water/wax emulsion that allows chain link penetration before it hardens. It’s usually more expensive than oil-based lubes or immersion waxing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with immersion waxing, your chain needs to be clean and dry before you start, so it’s best carried out on a new chain before use. The need to degrease your chain makes application a bit more time-consuming than with oil-based lubes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to ensure that you’ve applied the drip wax to both the inside and outside links of your chain and to the rollers, making application a bit more fiddly than an oil-based lube. The drip wax also usually needs to be allowed to dry overnight before you ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coating may not be as durable as immersion wax, so you may need to reapply the drip wax more often.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Drip wax options</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Squirt Long Lasting Chain Lube</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/SCP-ChainLubeFamily-Wood-Square1200px-800x800-1.jpg\" alt=\"Squirt Long Lasting Chain Lube\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/SCP-ChainLubeFamily-Wood-Square1200px-800x800-1.jpg 800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/SCP-ChainLubeFamily-Wood-Square1200px-800x800-1-300x240.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/SCP-ChainLubeFamily-Wood-Square1200px-800x800-1-768x615.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/SCP-ChainLubeFamily-Wood-Square1200px-800x800-1-750x601.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>Squirt Lubes</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Squirt’s formulation is a biodegradable emulsion of waxes in water, so it’s easy to apply to a degreased chain.

The manufacturer will have taken a standard chain – there are usually options from all the main brands – removed the factory grease and applied its own low friction treatment to the chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands usually claim ultra-low friction from their pre-treated chains, although they may be prone to contamination or the treatment may wash off in wet or dirty conditions. This may lower the lifetime of the treatment before friction increases, which may already be quite short. You can usually retreat the chain with the brand’s drip lube to restore the low friction qualities though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expensive, a pre-treated chain does give you a low friction coating without the faff of degreasing and waxing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pre-waxed chain options</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>CeramicSpeed UFO Chain</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed UFO chain Shimano 12sp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Ceramicspeed-UFO-chain-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>CeramicSpeed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The CeramicSpeed UFO chain comes pre-treated and ready to install.
