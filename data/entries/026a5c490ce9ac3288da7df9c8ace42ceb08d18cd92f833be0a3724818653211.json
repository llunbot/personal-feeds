The latest reports to support that idea come all the way from India. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/new-ipad-models-bis-india-listing/&amp;xcust=1-1-2289217-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">91mobiles</a> says that two new iPads are been registered in the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bis.gov.in/&amp;xcust=1-1-2289217-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Bureau of Indian Standards</a> website, while <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/new-ipad-a2898-a2899-bis-certification/&amp;xcust=1-1-2289217-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MySmartPrice</a> found another different pair of iPads on BIS, for a total of four new iPads models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new iPads are identified with the following model numbers: A2836, A2837, A2898, and A2899. BIS doesn’t provide more details, so it’s not known which iPads models these numbers correspond to. But the number of numbers match up with the rumors: Apple is expected to update the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro as well as the 10.9-inch iPad Air and introduce a new larger Air at 12.9 inches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, references to a new Battery Health feature were found in the code of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2287331/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-settings-iphone.html\">iPadOS 17.5 beta</a>. The code contained messages that seem to correspond to battery management features that have been in iOS since version 11.3. Apple often introduces new operating system features with new models, bolstering the idea that new iPads are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple will announce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2282952/ipad-pro-ipad-air-launch-shipping-may-2024.html\">new iPad Air and iPad Pro in May</a>. A March/April timeline was the original plan, but the software isn’t ready and production has a few hurdles to overcome.
