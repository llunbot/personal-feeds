For paid users, the information exposed included license keys and the names and email addresses of license key holders. For non-paying users, it was limited to email addresses associated with their accounts. Private code, emails, passwords, usernames, or other personal information were inaccessible.</p>\n<h2>Free-for-all</h2>\n<p>The hacker gained administrative access by obtaining an authentication key a Sourcegraph developer accidentally included in a code published to a public Sourcegraph instance hosted on Sourcegraph.com. After creating a normal user Sourcegraph account, the hacker used the token to elevate the account privileges to those of an administrator. The access token appeared in a pull request posted on July 14, the user account was created on August 28, and the elevation to admin occurred on August 30.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965211#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965211&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"367f83a92a54fb1804666de4639f41b18f2b63dab944f0ff3ef0be60756341b5","category":"Tech"}
