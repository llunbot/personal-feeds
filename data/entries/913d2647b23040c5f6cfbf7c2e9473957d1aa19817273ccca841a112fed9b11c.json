You didn't need a crib sheet to understand the badge, and body styles were mostly just sedans, with a smattering of station wagons, two-door coupes, and convertibles. That was before it helped kickstart the SUV craze; now instead of 3, 5, 7, the series run 2â€“8 and X1 through X7. And don't get me started on individual model names. Like the 2025 430i xDrive Gran Coupe.</p>\n<p>At first glance, if you're middle-aged like the average Ars reader, your brain probably says \"this is a 3 Series sedan.\" After all, it has a pair of doors on either side. But there is no requirement for a coupe to only have two doors: the name is derived from the French \"couper,\" meaning cut. And indeed, the roofline is cut down more than 2 inches lower than the actual 3 Series.</p>\n<p>There's also a hatch at the rear, rather than a trunk lid. So, technically it's a fastback body style, which BMW has decided to call Gran Coupe the way it calls station wagons Tourings. Pedantic pigeonholing of body style will probably take a back seat to discussion of the front grille, though.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-bmw-430i-gran-coupe-is-a-great-everyday-cruiser/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-bmw-430i-gran-coupe-is-a-great-everyday-cruiser/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
