In the event of an impact, the derailleur hanger is designed to bend or break, protecting your rear derailleur and frame.</p>\n<p>For many years, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-straighten-a-bent-mech-hanger/\">derailleur hangers</a> were frame-specific. If you broke one, it would often mean a trip to the bike shop, where the workshop would rummage through drawers of hangers to find a replacement – or they would have to order one in.</p>\n<p>That changed when SRAM launched its Universal Derailleur Hanger (UDH) standard in 2019.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll take you through what exactly SRAM UDH is, how it works, bike compatibility and how to remove and install the hanger.</p>\n<p>We’ll also explain how it differs from Shimano’s direct-mount standard and SRAM’s latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">T-Type Eagle Transmission drivetrains</a>.</p>\n<h2>What is SRAM UDH?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The derailleur hanger is composed of two to three parts (the spacer isn’t always required).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM UDH is designed to unify derailleur hanger standards.</p>\n<p>SRAM says consolidating different hanger designs makes replacing a bent hanger easier and helps optimise shifting because there are fewer variables.</p>\n<p>Like many other hangers, the UDH is made of two parts – the hanger itself and what SRAM refers to as the ‘UDH bolt’, which secures the hanger to the dropout.</p>\n<p>On some frames, you’ll need to use a ‘UDH frame washer’ between the hanger and bolt. It’s worth consulting your frame manufacturer to check if it’s required, although it’s generally used on split-pivot designs from brands such as Devinci, Orbea, Salsa and Trek.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some bikes require the use of a washer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Gary Walker / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>You’ll also need to make sure you use a compatible thru-axle to secure the rear wheel. SRAM specifies thru-axles must use a M12x1.0 thread pitch and a thread length of 12.7mm.</p>\n<p>SRAM has made the UDH’s design an open-standard. After-market brands such as Wheels Manufacturing offer anodised options, with different colour options to match to your bike.</p>\n<p>You’re also not limited to using only SRAM rear derailleurs. The UDH is compatible with other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupset</a> manufacturers, such as Shimano.</p>\n<p>Many brands have adopted the standard on their mountain bikes since UDH was announced. It’s much easier knowing a hanger will almost certainly be readily available at most bike shops, rather than having to trawl through the internet and find your specific derailleur hanger.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Scott’s Solace uses SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM UDH is also beginning to find traction on some <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/berria-belador-allroad-ltd/\">Berria Belador Allroad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/enve-mog-2023/\">ENVE MOG</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/scott-solace-eride-10-first-ride-review/\">Scott Solace</a>. However, it hasn’t fully caught on yet and it’s seldom seen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a>.</p>\n<h2>What happens to SRAM UDH if your chain jams?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It has a hook to re-rail chains if they fall off the bottom of the cassette</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Rather than simply break or bend, SRAM has designed the hanger to pivot backwards in the event of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-chains/\">chain</a> jamming. It can also slip slightly rearwards to help absorb an impact if the hanger is knocked.</p>\n<p>If the hanger pivots backwards, it can be pushed back forward, often without needing to loosen the thru-axle.</p>\n<p>It also sports a hooked lip to push the chain back onto the smallest cassette cog if it slips off. This prevents the chain from jamming between the dropout and cassette.</p>\n<h2>SRAM UDH compatibility: which bikes use SRAM UDH?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger is found on the majority of mountain bikes, and it’ll work with other drivetrain manufacturers too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Only bikes that are designed around SRAM UDH will work with the standard.</p>\n<p>Unlike other standards in the cycling industry, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom brackets</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/\">headsets</a>, the adoption of SRAM’s UDH standard among brands was rapid.

This eventually ported over to the road when the brand released <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-r9100-review/\">Dura-Ace R9100</a> and gravel with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-grx-review/\">GRX</a>.</p>\n<p>The direct-mount was designed to create a stronger connection between the frame and rear derailleur to improve shifting quality. Shimano also claimed it sped up wheel changes.</p>\n<p>Shimano included a ‘B-link’ to connect the rear derailleur to a conventional hanger because the Shadow derailleurs are positioned further to the rear.</p>\n<p>A direct-mount hanger sees the B-link removed and the rear derailleur bolted straight onto the hanger.</p>\n<p>Though a number of aftermarket products are available to fit a variety of bikes, the standard has never really gained traction.</p>\n<p>Shimano appears to be developing a universal derailleur hanger similar to SRAM T-Type, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-derailleur-hanger-patent/\">patent application filed in 2022</a>. The patent shows a hanger that slots on either side of the dropout and is held in place by the axle.</p>\n<h2>SRAM UDH and SRAM T-Type</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The UDH laid the frame design groundwork for T-Type’s novel approach.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In March 2023, SRAM launched its T-Type Eagle Transmission mountain bike drivetrains.</p>\n<p>Eagle Transmission does away with a derailleur hanger altogether, mounting the derailleur hanger directly to the frame.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s T-Type derailleurs bolt directly to the dropout.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While SRAM UDH isn’t needed for these new, hanger-free drivetrains, it did lay the groundwork for them.</p>\n<p>That’s because Eagle Transmission drivetrains are only compatible with bikes designed around the SRAM UDH standard.</p>\n<p>As well as ditching derailleur hangers, the Eagle Transmission drivetrains do away with limit screws and B-gap adjustment on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a>.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ab9bf8ee0616314aaf06c8b632f3acb64ccc4cb4c38793ce2e749301bfce44dc","category":"Cycling"}
