However, rapidly detecting new or unknown CSAM remained a bigger challenge for platforms as new victims continued to be victimized. Now, AI may be ready to change that.</p>\n<p>Today, a prominent child safety organization, Thorn, in partnership with a leading cloud-based AI solutions provider, Hive, announced the release of an AI model designed to flag unknown CSAM at upload. It's the earliest use of AI technology striving to expose unreported CSAM at scale.</p>\n<p>An expansion of Thorn's CSAM detection tool, <a href=\"https://safer.io/how-it-works/#compare\">Safer</a>, the new \"Predict\" feature uses \"advanced machine learning (ML) classification models\" to \"detect new or previously unreported CSAM and child sexual exploitation behavior (CSE), generating a risk score to make human decisions easier and faster.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ai-trained-on-real-child-sex-abuse-images-to-detect-new-csam/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ai-trained-on-real-child-sex-abuse-images-to-detect-new-csam/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7b00b09757ce37dcb58fd51e001859cc1c895f0b3c1d4acb43d448794adaf756","category":"Tech"}
