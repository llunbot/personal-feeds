You can also set app icons to appear larger, without text labels below them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Redesigned Control Center</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-control-center-customization.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nControl Center has been redesigned on iOS 18. Like the Home Screen, it is now more customizable, allowing you to rearrange and resize controls across multiple pages. You can easily add more controls from the all-new controls gallery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iMessage Enhancements</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-1.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\niMessage received a wide range of new features on iOS 18, including the ability to use any emoji as a Tapback reaction, text effects like \"Shake\" and \"Explode,\" formatting options like bold and underline, the ability to schedule messages to be sent later, RCS support for improved messaging with Android devices, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Redesigned Photos App</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-photos-app-select.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple says the Photos app received its biggest redesign ever on iOS 18, with tabs removed in favor of an all-in-one layout. The changes have been controversial, leading Apple to tweak the app's design throughout the iOS 18 beta testing period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Locks Apps Behind Face ID</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-locked-apps.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\niOS 18 introduces the ability to lock any app behind Face ID, Touch ID, or an iPhone's passcode for privacy and security purposes. In addition, you can now hide an app, which moves it to a hidden apps folder that is locked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Passwords App</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-passwords-app.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\niOS 18 includes an all-new Passwords app that surfaces many features previously available through the iCloud Keychain in the Settings app. The app makes it easier to manage passwords, passkeys, two-factor authentication codes, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Distraction Control</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-distraction-control.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1289\" />\r<br />\nBuilt into Safari, the new Distraction Control feature can be used to hide some website elements, such as newsletter sign-up forms and cookie permission prompts. However, Apple says the feature is not designed to be an ad blocker. If you hide an ad banner, it will become visible again if and when the content of the ad refreshes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Game Mode</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/Razer-Kishi-V2-Game-Controller-iPhone.jpeg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"844\" />\r<br />\nFirst introduced on the Mac, Game Mode is now available on the iPhone.
