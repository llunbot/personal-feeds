Its spare USB-C port means it can charge all those devices and one more at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>OneAdaptr OneGo: Updated design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually the second version of the OneGo, but OneAdaptr hasn’t added a 2.0 to mark the upgrade. The first version featured a detachable power bank part that featured a flip-out Apple Watch charger at the top, plus a pull-out kickstand at the bottom and a USB-C port for input and output charging. The 5W Qi AirPods charging pad was located not on the power bank but on the wired charging base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new OneGo really lives up to its name, with everything in a single piece that contains a fold-out Apple Watch charger and an AirPods charging base that doubles as a stand. This makes it a fully portable and compact solution for all your on-the-go charging needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The magnetic phone charger isn’t certified for MagSafe so it charges at 7.5W rather than 15W. This is quite common for magnetic power banks but the latest models—such as the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2277184/anker-maggo-powerbank-10k-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anker MagGo 10K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2487265/anker-maggo-10k-slim-power-bank-review-iphone-magnetic-battery-pack.html\" target=\"_blank\">MagGo 10K Slim</a>—utilize new Qi2 technology that supports 15W wireless charging.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank USB C Charging\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?resize=300%2C288&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?resize=768%2C737&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"983\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank USB C Charging\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?resize=300%2C288&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?resize=768%2C737&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"983\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank USB C Charging\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?resize=300%2C288&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-USB-C-Charging.jpg?resize=768%2C737&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"983\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For the fastest remote charging, you’ll want to carry a USB-C cable around with the OneGo power bank able to wired-charge an iPhone at up to 18W. This would make the power bank less travel-friendly as magnetic wireless charging is more immediate and requires no extra cable, but if you need faster charging (18W vs 7.5W) it’s a good option to have. The OneGo ships with a 1.5m right-angled USB-C cable, as well as a silky travel pouch. The pouch might seem a luxury but it protects the power bank in your bag and makes it easier to find when rummaging around for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneGo’s pop-up Watch charger feels robust when folded up for travel. It’s rated at just 2W, which won’t fast-charge, but if you need juice on the go—before all your activity counts for nothing and notifications get cut off—it will supply enough power to get you and your Watch to the next fixed power socket.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank front and back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank front and back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank front and back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-front-and-back.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Folded up, the OneGo just looks like a slightly chunky 10K power bank, but turn it over and you’ll see the fold-out Watch and AirPods charging points are flush to the back of the power bank. It measures 2.8 x 0.94 x H 4.7 inches (7 x 2.4 x 12cm). The whole package weighs 7.76oz (220g), which is significantly lighter than the original two-part version, which weighed 11.8oz (335g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/lift-4-in-1-magsafe-compatible-wireless-charging-10000mah-power-bank\" target=\"_blank\">Alogic Lift 4-in-1 MagSafe Compatible Wireless Charging 10,000mAh Power Bank</a> ($99.99 / £89.99) is a similar compact solution of a high-capacity power bank, MagSafe-compatible wireless charger and Apple Watch charger. It doesn’t have a base unit and therefore no stand or AirPods charging pad, although it does have two USB ports so you can charge using a cable. The Alogic power bank is a little smaller at 2.7 x 0.95 x 4.3 inches (6.8 x 2.4 x 10.8cm) but a touch heavier at 8oz (228g).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>OneAdaptr OneGo: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The wireless charging speeds are not the fastest (7.5W iPhone, 2W Apple Watch, 5W AirPods) but these are largely compromises based on the portability of the power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10000mAh battery capacity is high, and in our tests, we managed to get nearly two recharges of an iPhone 15 Pro, which is impressive and as high as we’ve seen in our 10K power bank tests. That’s higher than with the similar iPhone/Watch charging Alogic Lift power bank (1.5 charges). That means you can fully charge an iPhone (from 10 percent) nearly twice over using the power bank and probably have enough juice left for a full Watch recharge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get slimmer and lighter 10K power banks but not with built-in Apple Watch and AirPods charging stands. We have tested and reviewed 10K battery packs that offer greater charging power: the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2125585/baseus-magnetic-power-bank-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Baseus Magnetic 10K Power Bank</a> (187%) and Anker MagGo 10K Slim (188%) both offer better performance but of course, lack the integrated Apple Watch and AirPods modules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read our full roundups of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\">best MagSafe chargers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html\">best MagSafe power banks</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank Side Profiles\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank Side Profiles\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"OneAdaptr OneGo Magnetic Wireless Power Bank Side Profiles\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OneAdaptr-OneGo-Magnetic-Wireless-Power-Bank-Side-Profiles.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>OneAdaptr OneGo: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneAdaptr OneGo is $99/£70/CA$139/AU$150/€83,95 direct from OneAdaptr. For a multi-device charger, this is an attractive price for such a set of fixed and portable charging solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closest alternative solution, the Alogic Lift 4-in-1 MagSafe Power Bank, costs $99.99/£89.99/CA$129.99/AU$99.99/€109,99 but lacks the AirPods charging stand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>OneAdaptr OneGo: Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneAdaptr OneGo is either a power bank that transforms into a desk-based charging stand or a desk-based charging stand that can be carried as a portable power bank. The power bank’s ability to charge not just an iPhone but also the Apple Watch is also seen in a few other chargers, but none at this price point and none with a stand that can also charge your AirPods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OneGo is an impressive multifunctional Apple device charger that is reasonably priced and performs well. It’s not the fastest but the power bank is high capacity and the USB-C port enables speedy wired charging on top of the convenient wireless functions.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5f48f3c36c61c0eac55e2f67a744cac1d7cdbc42b9dfda93a4cf0b369e1d24d2","category":"Apple"}
