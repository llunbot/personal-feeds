The plaintiff argued its compensation committee intended to award just $77.5 million each year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe alleged error was attributed by the pension fund's lawyers to the committee's improper calculation of the restricted stock unit's \"fair values\" at the time of the grants, and said it misled shareholders who would be casting advisory votes on executive compensation, known as \"say-on-pay.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nU.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon disagreed, however,  saying Apple described its pay methods in detailed compensation tables in its 2023 proxy statement \"precisely,\" as securities laws and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Manhattan judge also found no proof that Apple's board of directors acted improperly in awarding pay, and said the plaintiff did not give the board enough time to consider its objections before suing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple proxy filings show Cook's compensation totaled about $99 million in both 2021 and 2022, including more than $82 million of stock awards each year. Cook's total pay declined to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/tim-cook-compensation-2023/\">$63.2 million for 2023</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-defeats-lawsuit-overpaid-tim-cook/\">Apple Defeats Lawsuit Claiming It Overpaid Tim Cook and Other Execs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-defeats-lawsuit-claiming-it-overpaid-tim-cook-and-other-execs.2418880/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ba8cbe344656e87b9b356d805f661d7f4d211dd468ce9b714af480b41c9c7ce","category":"Apple"}
