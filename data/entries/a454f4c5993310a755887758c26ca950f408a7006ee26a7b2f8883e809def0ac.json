With the right accessories, it can tell you where you are when you get lost, how many watts you’re struggling to put out, and even when it’s time to stop for a piece of cake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relying on GPS positioning satellites, the latest bike computers increasingly offer smartphone-style features and extensive ride and performance analysis alongside simple speed and distance data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might include mapping and navigation, previews of upcoming climbs, or even the ability to see the fastest times set by other riders on the stretch you’re currently pedalling along. And for riders searching for these features, the bike computer market has come to be dominated by Wahoo and Garmin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are still smaller brands worth considering. The main thing is to decide why you are buying a computer in the first place. If you want outstanding mapping that can guide you on and off-road, you’ll need to look towards options that boast navigation capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a data junkie, you will need to assess the connectivity of the device. However, if you are solely using the computer to upload your ride to Strava, you may be better served by a more budget option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you’ll find our guide to what we consider the best bike computers on the market, alongside advice on understanding their features and picking the best one for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our pick of the best GPS bike computers in 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Elemnt Roam V2:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Fwahoo-elemnt-roam-gps-cycling-computer%3Fsiteid%3D122609%26variant%3D27866788790355\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RRP £349.99 – Buy now from Condor Cycles for £349.99</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Garmin Edge 840 Solar:</strong><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20283&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fgarmin-edge-830-gps-enabled-computer-varedge830\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> </strong></a><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;campaign=best+gps&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fgarmin-edge-840-solar-cycle-computer%2F_%2FR-p-X8854915%3Fmc%3D8854915\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RRP £519.99 – Buy now from Decathlon for £499.99</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hammerhead Karoo 2:</strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.com%2Fp%2Fhammerhead-karoo-2-gps-bike-computer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1857&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;campaign=best+gps&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.com%2Fp%2Fhammerhead-karoo-2-gps-bike-computer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £359 – Buy now from Wiggle for £235.00</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Garmin Edge 1040 Solar:</strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fp%2Fgarmin-edge-1040-solar-gps-cycle-computer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Fgarmin-edge-1040-solar-head-unit%3Fvariant%3D41877189525654\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £629.99 – Buy now from Condor Cycles for £629.99 </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bryton Rider S800:<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rGxJ8I\" target=\"_blank\"> RRP £340 – Buy now from Amazon for £262.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Garmin Edge 540 Solar:</strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NyvAmu\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1857&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;campaign=best+gps&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.com%2Fp%2Fgarmin-edge-540-solar-bike-computer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £449.99 – Buy now from Wiggle for £399.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wahoo Elemnt Bolt 2.0:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PMPvPs\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £264.99 – Buy now from Amazon for £249.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Garmin Edge 830:</strong><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20283&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fgarmin-edge-830-gps-enabled-computer-varedge830\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;campaign=best+gps&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fgarmin-edge-830-cycling-gps-bike-computer%2F_%2FR-p-X8617927%3F\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £309.99 – Buy now from Decathlon for £299.99 </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Garmin Edge 530:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;campaign=best+gps&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fgarmin-edge-530-cycling-gps-bike-computer%2F_%2FR-p-X8617926%3Fmc%3D8617926\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £259.99 – Buy now from Decathlon for £219.99</a></strong> </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why should you trust our advice? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"giant-propel-14\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Lizzie Crabb</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re riders just like you and our choices are based on our extensive experience reviewing a wide range of cycling computers, as well as riding with them day in and day out when testing and reviewing other cycling gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our tech coverage is led by <em>Cyclist</em> tech editor and bike nerd <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/authors/sam-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Challis</a>, with input from a team of expert testers including website editor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/authors/matthew-loveridge\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Loveridge</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Wahoo Elemnt Roam V2: Easy to use</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/wahoo-elemnt-roam-review-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"wahoo-elemnt-roam-review-3\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>£349.99 | <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Fwahoo-elemnt-roam-gps-cycling-computer%3Fsiteid%3D122609%26variant%3D27866788790355\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy to configure and use</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>32GB storage</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Excellent app integration</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The big boss of Wahoo’s GPS cycling computer range, the Roam had an upgrade in October 2022 and the V2 includes multi-band GNSS satellite fixes for improved accuracy, a 64-colour screen and 32GB of memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the original, it boasts onboard rerouting and on-demand route generation that partners with existing functions such as routing you to a pre-downloaded course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Roam has also received climbing profiles – or Summit Segments as Wahoo calls them. Much like the higher end Garmins and the Hammerhead Karoo 2, climbs are colour-graded according to steepness and pop up when approaching an ascent on both pre-mapped and unmapped routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On GPS setup, you are prompted to download the Elemnt app which acts as the central hub for all the necessary information and data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app integration is seamless and makes up for what the computer lacks in touch-screen technology. Screen profiles, options and data fields can be changed easily through the app and sync automatically when both devices are turned on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take mapping, for example. After creating my route on a third-party app such as Strava or Ride With GPS, the route automatically synced to my pre-downloaded Elemnt Roam App and then onto the computer through Bluetooth in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo says that the new dual-band GPS is more precise and good for riding under dense tree cover or around tall buildings. The navigation system works well, but lacks heatmaps, so can lead you out onto busier roads to get you from A to B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roam has a respectable battery life of 17 hours, even at full functionality, despite the added storage capacity. A top-drawer product, but if you’re happy with a smaller screen the Bolt 2.0 still does pretty much the same job for £100 less.

That includes solar charging, with a brown surround to the 2.6in colour touchscreen and a thinner, transparent coating on the screen itself collecting the sun’s rays to boost the unit’s run time, in the case of the Edge 840 Solar to a claimed 32 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a non-solar option that shaves £70 off the list price, which we’d suggest might be a better purchase for UK riders and those not into epic adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features include multi-band GNSS for a more accurate location fix, a switch to the ‘Glances’-based home screen, which gives you a customisable choice of key summary stats, and on-the-fly climb profiles. There’s the same responsive touchscreen interface as the previous model Edge 830, augmented by an array of seven buttons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Routes are transferred seamlessly to the Edge 840 from the Garmin Connect phone app, which also allows you to customise your cycling computer. The phone connectivity also drives live tracking, group tracking and incident detection.

Hammerhead Karoo 2: Phone-like functionality</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/07101259/hammerhead-karoo-216-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"hammerhead-karoo-216\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>£235.00 (RRP £359) | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1857&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;campaign=best+gps&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.com%2Fp%2Fhammerhead-karoo-2-gps-bike-computer\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Works like a smartphone</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hill climb profiles on the fly</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumping straight from OS paper maps to a cycling GPS for navigation would have been fine, if it weren’t for smartphones having arrived in the meantime. As it is, switching from mapping on your phone to that on a cycling computer is like going from an iMac to an Amstrad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the Android operating system, with 32GB of storage, and including free access to worldwide mapping, the Karoo aims to bridge the gap between the two experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering turn-by-turn navigation both on and off-road, the Karoo’s base map offers a significant level of detail, with nearby points of interest from cafes to toilets all flagged. Hit a climb and it will bring up the oncoming elevation, while it’s also possible to drop a pin and have the unit quickly create a route to it. Unlike other units, searching and sorting routes and locations is easy, partly thanks to the unit’s in-built QWERTY keyboard. If you aren’t riding a preplanned route, you still get climb profiles on the fly, although that’s functionality now matched by all the major competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy to ping notifications from your phone, the Karoo also stands out thanks to its GSM cellular SIM card slot. With 3G and 4G capability sitting alongside more standard Bluetooth, ANT+ and Wi-Fi connectivity, you’re able to get on the internet without a smartphone, and can import routes directly from your favourite app, while also pulling in real-time data including Strava segments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very much positioning itself as a tech firm rather than a hardware maker, Hammerhead (now owned by SRAM) promises to provide fortnightly updates to the unit’s firmware and functionality. That means the Karoo 2’s capabilities are likely to grow in the future, and as such the Hammerhead Karoo 2 has the making of a capable rival to more established brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 3.2in; <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 14 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> GSM cellular, Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 167g; <strong>Other features:</strong> High-res screen</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Hammerhead Karoo 2 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>4.

The solar screen is slightly difficult to read though, due to its internal coating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes with multi-band GNSS satellite tracking, which ups the accuracy of its GPS trace (something that’s included in the latest version of the Wahoo Elemnt Roam and the lower priced Edge x40 models too).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin’s touchscreen works really well wet or dry, with or without gloves and the large 3.5-inch diagonal means that you can see plenty of data fields. The maps have lots of detail and it’s very quick to upload a course to follow. Popularity-based routing means that you’ll be kept to cycle-friendly routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Edge 1040 gives you loads of ride stats, including Stamina, which keeps tabs on your energy expenditure as your ride and tells you how much you’ve got left in the tank. It automatically switches to a climb profile when you hit a hill and shows your progress as you tackle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the standard GPS computer functions you’d expect are included too, along with access to Garmin’s extensive Connect ecosystem.

Its main boast is an extremely long battery life – up to 36 hours – coming close to rivalling the Garmin Edge 1040 Solar at a much lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get around 50% charge in an hour which, combined with the battery life, make it a good option for long days out on the bike or multi-day trips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rider S800 features a decent sized colour touchscreen, which is easy to read and use whilst riding.

As with the Edge 840 and 1040, there’s a solar charging option which boosts the price as well as the run time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Functionality is the same as for the Edge 840 and includes much of that offered by the premium Edge 1040, including the customisable Glances-based user interface, ClimbPro and rapid USB-C charging. It also links up to Garmin’s Varia rearview radars to alert you to approaching traffic and uses Garmin’s cycling-specific popularity routing to keep you off high traffic routes in the first place. It will alert you to a high traffic road ahead and even to sharp bends and steep descents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most functions work well without the touchscreen, although a few such as panning around maps are fiddly. It’s also quite easy to press a button accidentally while using the Edge 540 when riding. As with the Edge 840, in our review we questioned the usefulness of solar charging, at least in the UK. That led us to suggest that the non-solar 840 was a better purchase at the same list price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 2.6in; <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 32 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> Multi-band GNSS, GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 86g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Solar charging option, button operation only</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-edge-540-solar-review\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin Edge 540 Solar review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Garmin Edge 540 deals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Garmin Edge 540 Solar deals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>7.

Similar to its bigger brother the Roam, the Bolt offers turn-by-turn navigation, seamless route syncing from the companion app, as well as on-board and on-demand navigation through its impressive mapping system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gives live text and call alerts, relays Strava Live data and fully links to all Wahoo accessories. There is the capability to sync the LED lights across the top of the unit to act as a visual reference for things such as speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bolt 2.0 now benefits from a 64-colour display and ever so slightly rejigged ergonomics. It also now has a large 16GB of internal storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of features, this update has also improved its functionality to the point that it’s much more like a miniature version of the firm’s Roam halo model than the former version. This means you now get additions like live tracking and rerouting, plus on device route planning. It’ll even act as a remote for your Wahoo brand turbo trainer. Despite these upgrades, the smaller and more aerodynamic shape remains, which should keep racers happy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 2.2in; <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 15 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 68g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Colour screen</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-colour-screen-bigger-memory-better-gps-computer\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Elemnt Bolt 2.0 review</a> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>8.

In fact, it’s really just a smaller version of the Edge 1030 Plus. It contains live segments via third-party app Strava, live tracking, on-board route planning, rerouting capabilities alongside safety features like Incident Detection and even a pin-locked bike alarm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unit will tell you when you need to eat and drink and also sync to your Shimano Di2 groupset to let you toggle through the computer’s screens from the levers of your bike.

However, if you can manage without that and Garmin’s newest tech, the Edge 530 is something of a bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 2.6in; <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 20 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 76g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Non-touchscreen</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Garmin Edge 530 deals</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best bike computers: What features should I look for?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maps and navigation: </strong>Most cycling computers will offer some form of on-screen mapping or, at the very least, turn-by-turn navigation. Most will also allow you to preload routes to follow and many will even allow you to renavigate on the fly, although compared to using your phone the search function can often feel a bit clunky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart notifications: </strong>Smart notifications are when you sync the computer to your phone and receive notifications on the go. Most will send through messages and call alerts allowing you to keep tabs on what’s going on without having to reach for your back pocket. Many will also transmit data back to your phone, letting your contacts follow your ride and alerting them if something is wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Battery life: </strong>If you plan to spend long days in the saddle exploring then you will need to look at options with healthy battery life. Most cycling computers will last up to 18 hours albeit when used conservatively, many much longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sensor compatibility: </strong>This could be an external power meter, heart rate monitor or cadence sensor. If you want to use any of these, you should check the computer’s ability to connect to sensors and devices. Some only allow connection to one at a time but most allow multiple connections using ANT+ and/or Bluetooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>In the mood for shopping?
