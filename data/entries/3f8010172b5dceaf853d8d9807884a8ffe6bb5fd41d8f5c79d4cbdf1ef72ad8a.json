Availability will, of course, depend on location, as will COVID-19 safety procedures at a given Apple Store.</p>\n<p>Apple's website offers multiple ways to find out if your nearest retail location has the battery pack in stock. For example, if you're in the US, the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/1305166/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C1305166%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;subid1=ArsMagSafeBattery\" target=\"_blank\">online store page for the product</a> attempts to automatically detect your ZIP code, or you can enter your ZIP code manually. The product page will then say whether the battery pack is available at the closest location.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781710#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781710&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3f8010172b5dceaf853d8d9807884a8ffe6bb5fd41d8f5c79d4cbdf1ef72ad8a","category":"Tech"}
