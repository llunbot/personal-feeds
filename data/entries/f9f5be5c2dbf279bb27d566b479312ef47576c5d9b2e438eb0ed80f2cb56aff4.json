The spirit, technology, and even software of PLATO live on in modern retrocomputing re-creations. In today's article, we'll look at two of these services and demonstrate how almost any computer can be a modern-day PLATO terminal, too.</p>\n<h2>Sign in and turn on</h2>\n<p>Although other resurrected PLATO instances are around, today we'll be looking at two that specifically cater to the curious public, <a href=\"https://irata.online/\">IRATA.ONLINE</a> (yes, Atari spelled backwards, just like in M.U.L.E.) and <a href=\"https://www.cyber1.org/\">Cyber1</a>. Both sites operate a server running an emulated PLATO environment with many of the same software components, but the specific mix of lessons (i.e., PLATO applications, more or less) and their front-ends differ somewhat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962768#p3\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962768&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f9f5be5c2dbf279bb27d566b479312ef47576c5d9b2e438eb0ed80f2cb56aff4","category":"Tech"}
