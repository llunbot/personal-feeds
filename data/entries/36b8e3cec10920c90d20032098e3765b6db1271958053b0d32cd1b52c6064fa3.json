{"title":"Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, Interviewed in the Financial Times","link":"https://www.ft.com/content/7f0a45b0-a3cc-4e1c-be71-1b7b42958d4d","date":1748970693000,"content":"\n<p>Matthew Garrahan, in the Financial Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sir Jony Ive remembers the day in 1997 when he first met Laurene\nPowell Jobs, outside the house she shared with her late husband,\nSteve. [...]</p>\n\n<p>“I was often at the house,” Ive says. “Certainly on the weekends,”\nsays Powell Jobs, sitting across from him on a long table. Ive\nnods. “It feels to me like we grew up together,” he says. “We’ve\ngone through hard things and happy things...”</p>\n\n<p>“... family and children and work,” says Powell Jobs.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s that Freud quote,” Ive says. “All there is, is work and\nlove. Love and work.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the device(s) Ive is <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/21/sam-and-jony-io\">spearheading development of at io</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ive deftly dodges my attempts to get him to tell me what it is but\nhints he was motivated by a disillusionment with how our\nrelationship with devices has evolved. “Many of us would say we\nhave an uneasy relationship with technology at the moment,” he\nsays. I’m guessing this includes screen addiction and the harms\ncaused by social media. Whatever the device is, driving its design\nis “a sense of: we deserve better. Humanity deserves better.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On Powell Jobs as the owner, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/26/the-atlantic-has-an-owner-committed-to-the-cause\">committed to the cause</a>, of a major US news publication:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Signalgate story prompted a furious response from the US\npresident, who called Goldberg a “sleazebag” before inviting him\nin for an interview weeks later. “It’s very important to emphasise\nthat, despite having the majority ownership stake in The Atlantic,\nI’m involved in the business side and not the editorial side,”\nPowell Jobs says. “We feel very strongly that freedom of the press\nmeans they are free to write the truth as they find it, and follow\na story as they find it. It’s not up to us to approve or\ndisapprove.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the years after Steve Jobs’s death, while Ive still worked at Apple, I observed that at keynote events, Powell Jobs and Ive always sat next to each. Always. The media seats are never all that close to the VIP seats in the first two rows, but both of them are rather easily identified by the backs of their heads. I observed, a few times, that the two generally only chatted with each other in those anxious moments of prelude before a show. I know those first few post-Steve keynotes were emotional for Ive. But I can’t even imagine what they were like for Powell Jobs.</p>\n\n<p>It always moved me to observe that they went through them together, almost literally leaning on each other in their seats.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/03/ive-powell-jobs-interview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"36b8e3cec10920c90d20032098e3765b6db1271958053b0d32cd1b52c6064fa3","category":"Tech"}
