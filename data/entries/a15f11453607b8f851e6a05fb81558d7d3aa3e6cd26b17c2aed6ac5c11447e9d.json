He was going to drink coffee in \nhipster cafes and chat into the night over glasses of beer. </p>\n\n<p>It was the start of his stolen year. </p>\n\n<p>Russian authorities <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich-detained-russia-cd03b0f3\">detained Evan</a> in Yekaterinburg on March 29, \n2023, and threw him into a jail cell in Moscow. He was a fully \naccredited journalist on a reporting trip and was detained on an \nallegation of espionage, which he, his employer and the U.S. \ngovernment vociferously deny. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kudos to the Journal for putting together a huge package to raise awareness of Gershkovich’s unjust incarceration. Tons of coverage online, but man, sometimes print design can do things that otherwise can’t be expressed. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1773644279711207464\">What a statement today’s front page makes</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/gershkovich\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a15f11453607b8f851e6a05fb81558d7d3aa3e6cd26b17c2aed6ac5c11447e9d","category":"Tech"}
