Eli Iserbyt and Lucinda Brand, both coming off of victories at this past weekend’s Besançon race, lead the series.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/antwerp-world-cup-round-cancelled/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f59d94768ec21fc126b67bafd50074e9b62e08fc32a8cb8577d81b43f1b5f805","category":"Cycling"}
