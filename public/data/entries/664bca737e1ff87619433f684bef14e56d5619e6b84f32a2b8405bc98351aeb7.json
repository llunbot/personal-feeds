The seams are sealed and the hems bonded rather than sewn, but there’s no additional patch in the seat and the fabric doesn’t stretch.</p>\n<p>We found the fit a little tight, although the legs are long and they’re comfortable to pedal in.</p>\n<p>There are two waterproof zipped hand pockets on the sides of the legs, where we felt their contents could be vulnerable in a crash. The fly isn’t waterproof and we found our crotch ended up damp.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/mountain-bike-shorts/pearl-izumi-summit-wxb-shell-shorts-review/\">Read our full Pearl Izumi Summit WxB Shell shorts </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/mountain-bike-shorts/pearl-izumi-summit-wxb-shell-shorts-review/\">review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Buyer’s guide to what to look for in waterproof mountain bike shorts</h2>\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the key features to look for when buying waterproof mountain bike shorts.</p>\n<h3>Waterproofing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gore-Tex material is rarely used on waterproof shorts but is a top performer when it is.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Waterproofness is rated in millimetres of water head. Look out for shorts made of fabric with at least 10,000mm head, more if possible.</p>\n<p>There’s no point in having a waterproof fabric if rain and mud can find their way in through the seams, so look for internal seam sealing to help keep the weather out.</p>\n<h3>Breathability</h3>\n<p>Along with waterproofing, you also want enough breathability to stop sweat from wetting you from the inside.</p>\n<p>Again, there’s an objective measurement of this – grams of water vapour transmitted per metre squared per 24 hours. A good level is 10,000g/m²/24h, but the best breathable waterproof fabrics can improve significantly on this.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth looking for zipped vents in the thighs that can be opened up in warmer conditions to up the airflow.</p>\n<h3>Fabric thickness</h3>\n<p>A thinner fabric is likely to be more breathable than a thicker waterproof one.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, too thin and it may not be so durable or as comfortable to ride in. So there’s a compromise here.</p>\n<p>Many of the best waterproof shorts we’ve tested are most comfortable when worn with a quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/mountain-bike-shorts/undershorts-and-short-liners/\">liner short</a>.</p>\n<h3>Stretch</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A stretch material will enable you to fit knee pads under the shorts without restricting movement.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A good fit will be augmented by enough stretch to accommodate pedalling movements.</p>\n<p>A fabric with a little stretch from elastane content will be more comfortable on your bottom half than a hardshell fabric.</p>\n<h3>Pockets</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A zipped pocket is the best way to ensure your valuables don’t disappear when descending.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you want to carry gear in your shorts, a range of pockets is essential.</p>\n<p>Often, waterproof mountain biking shorts are designed more as overshorts though, so you may find they’re a bit lacking.</p>\n<p>We found in testing that many waterproof shorts had pockets on the outside of the edge.</p>\n<p>That’s potentially risky because any contents could be damaged (or damage you) in an off.</p>\n<h3>Waterproof zips</h3>\n<p>Look out for waterproof zips too, which will up protection for anything you carry in your pockets. A waterproof fly (or no fly at all) will ensure water doesn’t find its way in during a deluge.</p>\n<h3>Leg length</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Closing the gap between the knee pad and the shorts means there’s less chance of water intruding from the bottom of the short.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You want enough leg length to reach your knee pads and ideally cover them, without interfering with them. There’s no point in wearing waterproof shorts if rain and surface water just runs up your legs.</p>\n<h3>Adjustability</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Waistline adjustability will make sure your shorts don’t slip down while you are riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You need enough adjustability for a comfortable fit.</p>\n<p>Many brands make their waterproof mountain bike shorts in a good range of sizes, so assuming you’ve got your sizing right to start with, this may not be too much of an issue, but it’s good to be able to fine-tune the fit.</p>\n<p>Also look out for silicone grippers in the waistband, which will help keep wet shorts from slipping down as you ride.</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"664bca737e1ff87619433f684bef14e56d5619e6b84f32a2b8405bc98351aeb7","category":"Cycling"}
