[...]</p>\n\n<p>LetMeSpy was an Android phone monitoring app that was purposefully\ndesigned to stay hidden on a victim’s phone home screen, making\nthe app difficult to detect and remove. When planted on a person’s\nphone — often by someone with knowledge of their phone passcode — apps like LetMeSpy continually steal that person’s messages,\ncall logs and real-time location data.</p>\n\n<p>A copy of the database was obtained by nonprofit transparency\ncollective DDoSecrets, which indexes leaked datasets in the public\ninterest, and shared with TechCrunch for analysis. The data showed\nthat LetMeSpy, until recently, had been used to steal data from\nmore than 13,000 compromised Android devices worldwide, though\nLetMeSpy’s website claimed prior to the breach that it controlled\nmore than 236,000 devices.</p>\n\n<p>The database also contained information that shows the spyware was\ndeveloped by a Krakow-based tech company called Radeal, whose\nchief executive Rafal Lidwin did not respond to a request for\ncomment. LetMeSpy is the latest spyware operation to shut down in\nthe past year in the wake of a security incident that exposed\nvictims’ data, but also the identities of its real-world\noperators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like cockroaches scurrying when the lights come on.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/05/letmespy\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2ee8b1d3975b97c66f6b4e483391a8cadaf546ebf96994b6211390ed7d19c6aa","category":"Tech"}
