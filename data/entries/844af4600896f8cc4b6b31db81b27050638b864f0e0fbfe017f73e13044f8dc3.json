Multiple posts can be scheduled per day, up to 75 days in advance, but it's not possible to schedule replies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo use the feature, create a post, select the three-dot menu in the top-left corner, and select \"Schedule.\" Once a time and date for posting has been selected, you can view, delete, or edit the post from the drafts folder. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnnouncing the feature on <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DFLhrwRT8pC\">Thursday</a>, Instagram head Adam Mosseri added that Threads is also adding a way to \"markup\" re-shared posts by drawing over, highlighting, or adding arrows to the existing post. The feature is rolling out to a \"few countries with more to come soon,\" said Mosseri. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThreads recently announced a handful of new features, including performance analytics for content creators, and support for writing and saving multiple drafts via Threads for web. Threads is also introducing X-style Community Notes, as part of Meta's broader shift away from fact-checking moderation.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/\">Threads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/threads-now-lets-you-schedule-posts/\">Threads Now Lets You Schedule Posts Up to 75 Days in Advance</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-now-lets-you-schedule-posts-up-to-75-days-in-advance.2448023/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"844af4600896f8cc4b6b31db81b27050638b864f0e0fbfe017f73e13044f8dc3","category":"Apple"}
