Developers and public beta testers enrolled in Apple's respective programs can toggle on beta updates directly from System Settings on the Mac, and the Software Update section in the Watch app on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/beta-updates-watchos-9-5.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1984\" />\r<br />\nApple's new beta installation method replaces the profiles that have previously been used for installing both developer and public watchOS and macOS updates. On the developer side, enabling betas now requires an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> enrolled in the Apple Developer Program.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing a developer profile without an associated developer account is no longer a possibility, so only registered developers will be able to get access to the developer beta going forward. The same goes for the public betas, though access to the public beta program is free and open to anyone, unlike the developer program, which costs $99 per year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor minor beta updates, the changes won't have a big impact, but when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, and macOS 14 are announced, the ‌Apple ID‌ requirement will prevent those who do not have a developer account from being able to install the developer betas. In past years, non-developers have been able to use shared developer profiles to get early access to new software.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-9/\">watchOS 9</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239\">macOS Ventura</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-mac-tvos-watchos-programming.135\">iOS, Mac, tvOS, watchOS Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/macos-ventura-watchos-beta-installation-change/\">Simplified iOS 16.4 Beta Installation Method Expands to Latest macOS Ventura 13.4 and watchOS 9.5 Betas</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/simplified-ios-16-4-beta-installation-method-expands-to-latest-macos-ventura-13-4-and-watchos-9-5-betas.2386557/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bab5d9db245c5c743226893841e6a502eda4f7443fb9fccd5a00f43435282d3e","category":"Apple"}
