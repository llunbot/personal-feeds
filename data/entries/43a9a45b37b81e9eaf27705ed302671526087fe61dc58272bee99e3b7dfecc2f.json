I feel like I’ve been caught in a tornado of events this year and wanted to give y’all a brief update about what’s been going on behind the scenes at The Radavist over the past few months. Read on for a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bazaar\" target=\"_blank\">Rad Bazaar</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/membership/join\" target=\"_blank\">Radavist Membership</a> update!</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Hope-Tech-Petor-Georgallou-19-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Hope-Tech-Petor-Georgallou-19-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Hope-Tech-Petor-Georgallou-19-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Hope-Tech-Petor-Georgallou-19-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dear_susan_/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Petor Georgallou</a></em></p>\n<p>We’ve been working with our web developer to streamline the website, and that includes finally refreshing our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/membership/join\" target=\"_blank\">Membership</a> program. It has been a heroic effort, and Ian has been killing it. Think of it like relocating a house. It’s resting on a new foundation, and all the back-end infrastructure has been replaced, and it’s all running under one roof.</p>\n<p>Because my time is spent in a tug-of-war between back-of-house/business direction and front-facing content production, I’ve been working 12 to 14-hour days since November. If things feel like they’ve fallen off priority, it’s because the team here and Cari and I have been hammering hard like Dwarves in Khazad-dûm, and yes, we’ve <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6J7CvdRNWWk?si=wIoW_qlyLPnNBCok&amp;t=42\" target=\"_blank\">startled the Balrog</a>. But… <em>It’s not that bad</em>! The Balrog is just really into <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CjO1FMO-0bI?si=2vjVUExlv2R7Qui5&amp;t=1174\" target=\"_blank\">second-wave Finnish funeral doom metal</a>. It’s just a misunderstood entity.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let’s go over some of the changes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/1984-Ritchey-Annapurna-Competition-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/1984-Ritchey-Annapurna-Competition-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/1984-Ritchey-Annapurna-Competition-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/1984-Ritchey-Annapurna-Competition-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>By the way, the <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/1984-ritchey-annapurna/\" target=\"_blank\">24″ Annapurna</a> is going up for sale once I’m home at the end of the month. Any takers? $1800 shipped…</em></p>\n<h3>Rad Bazaar</h3>\n<p>The cycling world’s first membership-supported used gear marketplace was a great idea. I spoke about it back in 2015 here on the site, and then our buddy Kyle Klain prodded us to make a prototype in 2022, which was then scrapped by the corporation that owned us for a few years. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-radavist-is-an-independent-website/\" target=\"_blank\">Once we got the website back</a>, we immediately launched the Rad Bazaar, only to have other cycling websites take note and copy it directly. <em>We’ll take it as a compliment…</em></p>\n<p>Our Rad Bazaar is now under the URL of <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bazaar\" target=\"_blank\">theradavist.com/bazaar</a>. We’ll have an auto-direct from the old URL set up soon. And yes, right now it’s “up,” but the front marketplace hasn’t been updating. It’s on our list and we’re working on it!</p>\n<p>We’re also implementing a system to ban the scammers. In the meantime, be sure to <strong>post photos of your product with a piece of paper showing your name and date</strong>, please!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/membership/join\" target=\"_blank\">Radavist Membership Radavist Membership Radavist Membership!</a></h3>\n<h2><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/membership/join\" target=\"_blank\">PLEASE SIGN UP TO SUPPORT US!</a></h2>\n<p>Full stop. This is the future of The Radavist. And without a Member-supported core, The Radavist will wither.</p>\n<p>Media is a hot mess right now, and bike media is super hot and messy. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we’re still 100% paywall-free. The ad revenue ain’t what it used to be and while we love the brands that are helping us out, we need our readership to step it up, big time.</p>\n<p>We don’t have annoying pop-ups driving you to sign up (except for that one for our Newsletter), and I really don’t like begging for money – but I will ;-) – so we planted the Membership sign-up on the front of the website, just below the fold. You can’t miss it. You can even use Apple Pay. It’s so simple!</p>\n<p><em>We’re working on a profile for the Membership that will tie in directly to The Radavist’s content. More on that to come…</em></p>\n<p>I’m in Los Angeles right now, and I just got a coffee at a swanky shop yesterday. It was $7. Surely we’re worth more than a cup of coffee? A Washed Gesha even.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/2025-LA-Invitational-Cover-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/2025-LA-Invitational-Cover-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/2025-LA-Invitational-Cover-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/2025-LA-Invitational-Cover-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-33.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-33.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025-LA-Invitational-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>We need 4x our current numbers to be stable</strong>. I don’t want the site to get any bigger. I just want to pay our staff more. <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/the-bike-industry-is-broken/\" target=\"_blank\">Growth for the sake of it is why the industry is in the shitter right now</a>. I think we’re in a great spot, but we’re running very lean. Let’s throw some fucking gas on this fire! Boooooom!</p>\n<p><strong>YOUR</strong> money goes to paying super-talented people like Hailey, Travis, Spencer, Nick, Miguel, Petor, Ryan, Taylor (in no particular order), and all the contributors who send in stories around the world. Supporting us means we’ll be less beholden to these uncertain macroeconomic fluctuations.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting us means you are literally saving this website. You!</strong></p>\n<p>Supporting us stokes the Balrog out. Big time.</p>\n<p>Our content is the best on the web. Full stop. We do it all from the heart. No <em>poseurs</em> here. We’ve been covering framebuilders, social rides, profiling bike shops, bicycle touring, and more since the early aughts before mainstream bike media realized it was a rich source of content. There are a lot of people out there who do this for SEO, but we do it from our hearts. It’s our soul over here. You can’t fake the funk.</p>\n<p>This was the big one. Let’s talk about some of the ancillary features now…</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/membership/join\" target=\"_blank\">PLEASE SIGN UP TO SUPPORT US!</a></h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/The-Radavist-Realm-Camera-Bag-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/The-Radavist-Realm-Camera-Bag-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/The-Radavist-Realm-Camera-Bag-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/The-Radavist-Realm-Camera-Bag-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Give-Aways</h3>\n<p>I’ve been slacking on these.

It’s free. It helps us market our content. And allows you a weekly recap of what we’ve been doing.</p>\n<p>We’re also working on a <strong>Membership-only email newsletter</strong> that I’ll be writing. Kind of like what <a href=\"https://mountaingazette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mountain Gazette</a> does, and hopefully as good!</p>\n<p>So if you like my ramblings, there’s another reason to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/membership/join\" target=\"_blank\">support our Membership</a>. It’ll preview forthcoming stories and travel logs, showcasing behind-the-scenes looks at what goes into making our content. I’d like to have it up and running by August.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Kenyon-Devore-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Kenyon-Devore-51.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Kenyon-Devore-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/Kenyon-Devore-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Happy Friday</h3>\n<p>Hey, get out on your bike. Shoot some photos of your friends getting rad. Turn off the news. Turn off Instagram. Send that sketchy jump. Be nice, say hi to other riders, and stop to observe that frog or newt and smell that flower.</p>\n<p>We love you all, and I promise we’ll have things running smoother in the near future!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/membership/join\" target=\"_blank\">PLEASE SIGN UP TO SUPPORT US!</a></h2>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/rad-bazaar-radavist-membership/\">Rad Bazaar, Radavist Membership, Radavist Calendar, and Happy Friday!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"43a9a45b37b81e9eaf27705ed302671526087fe61dc58272bee99e3b7dfecc2f","category":"Cycling"}
