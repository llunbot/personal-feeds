With the new limit options, iOS 18 now takes a proactive approach to improving battery longevity by recommending a specific charging limit to users via a notification.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe recommendation also appears in the Settings app under Battery → Charging. The charging limit feature remains exclusive to the iPhone 15 lineup on the first iOS 18 beta, with the option not found on the iPhone 14 Pro or older.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-recommended-charge-limit.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn a related change, anecdotal reports suggest that iOS 18 could be recalibrating some devices' maximum battery capacity percentage. In Settings ➝ Battery ➝ Battery Health, \"Maximum Capacity\" is a measure of battery capacity relative to when the device was new. Lower capacity can result in fewer hours of usage between charges.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-18-developer-beta-iphone/\">How to Get the iOS 18 Developer Beta on Your iPhone</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe first iOS 18 beta is available for Apple Developer Program members, and a public beta will follow in July. After beta testing is complete, the update should be widely released to all users with an iPhone XS or newer in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-charging-limit-recommendations/\">iOS 18 Actively Recommends Charging Limit Based on iPhone 15 Usage</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-actively-recommends-charging-limit-based-on-iphone-15-usage.2429011/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ff7d992cdb7830b670c195e6b264062099c796f2c657c239d3a1c3180c6f6fae","category":"Apple"}
