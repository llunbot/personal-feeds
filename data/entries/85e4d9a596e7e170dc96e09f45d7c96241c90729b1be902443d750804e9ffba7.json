Most people would probably be hard-pressed to tell the new ones from the old ones just by looking at them, but after hands-on sessions with both sizes of both tablets, the small details (especially for the Pros) all add up to a noticeably refined iPad experience.</p>\n<h2>iPad Airs: Bigger is better</h2>\n<p>But let's begin with the new Airs since there's a bit less to talk about. The 11-inch iPad Air (technically the sixth-generation model) is mostly the same as the previous-generation A14 and M1 models, design-wise, with identical physical dimensions and weight. It's still the same slim-bezel design Apple introduced with the 2018 iPad Pro, just with a 60 Hz LCD display panel and Touch ID on the power button rather than Face ID.</p>\n\n<p>So when Apple says the device has been \"redesigned,\" the company is mainly referring to the fact that the webcam is now mounted on the long edge of the tablet rather than the short edge. This makes its positioning more laptop-y when it's docked to the Magic Keyboard or some other keyboard.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022530#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022530&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85e4d9a596e7e170dc96e09f45d7c96241c90729b1be902443d750804e9ffba7","category":"Tech"}
