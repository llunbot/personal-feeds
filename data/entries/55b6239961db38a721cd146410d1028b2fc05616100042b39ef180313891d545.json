If you haven’t updated yet here’s what you need to know about the macOS Ventura system requirements so you can find out whether your Mac is compatible with Ventura and if you are able to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">install Ventura on your Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if your Mac is compatible with Ventura it might be the case that you could just update to Sonoma and we recommend that you do so (read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1984389/macos-sonoma-vs-macos-ventura-should-you-update.html\">macOS Sonoma vs macOS Ventura</a>). However, it’s not the case that all Macs that run Ventura can run Sonoma, so we will include details of those Macs that can update to Ventura – but not Sonoma. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1942421/macos-14-sonoma-compatibility-features.html\">Which Macs can run Sonoma</a> for more information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t possible to install Ventura on every Mac. Every year more Macs miss out on updating to the latest version of macOS, although there are ways to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672461/how-to-install-macos-on-unsupported-mac.html\">install a new macOS on an unsupported Mac</a>, if you feel confident. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system requirements for macOS 13 Ventura are as follows. However, you should remember that just because your Mac can run Ventura, that doesn’t mean that you will get <em>all</em> the features. Some of the Macs supported by Ventura – especially Intel-based models – do not support all the new functions.

Many of the Macs that are not supported by Ventura were still being sold by Apple until quite recently. The 2014 Mac mini was sold until 2018, the ‘trash can’ Mac Pro until 2019, and the 2017 MacBook Air was sold until July 2019. We had thought that Apple wouldn’t remove those Macs from the supported list, since people might have purchased the model such a short time ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bear in mind, however, that these ‘unlucky’ Macs can stay on (or upgrade to) macOS Monterey, and will still be officially supported by Apple for at least two more years. They might not be able to use the latest features, but they’ll keep getting security patches and other ongoing support.

If your Mac is from 2017 (unless it’s an iMac Pro) you will not be able to install anything beyond Ventura. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macs that don’t get all the Ventura features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even some of the ‘supported’ Macs are not able to take advantage of all the features in Ventura. Intel Macs miss out on a number of features including Live Captions, Dictation emoji support, Reference Mode with Sidecar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t new. Many of the features of Monterey, such as Universal Control, Spatial Audio and AirPlay to Mac required either the M1 chip, or one of the more modern Intel-powered Macs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/784171/macos-13-ipados-16-apple-silicon-features.html\">New macOS features that will only work on the newest models</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macs that run Ventura</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering whether the Mac you own will be able to run Ventura? We outline the Macs that are compatible with the new version of the macOS below. Hopefully, you can easily identify your Mac from the descriptions below but if not, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671943/what-mac-do-i-have.html\">Which Mac do I have?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook models from 2017 or later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the line of slimmer and smaller 12in MacBook models with Retina displays that Apple introduced in March 2015–except that the 2015 and 016 models are no longer included, as of Ventura. If you have one of the 2017 MacBooks, available in gold, silver or Space Gray, you should have no problems upgrading to Ventura.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Air models from 2018 or later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018 Apple gave the MacBook Air a new look. If you have the older larger model that only came in silver, it won’t be supported by Ventura. The 2017 model was sold right up until 2019, so it’s likely that quite a few are still in use. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Pro models from 2017 of later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year it was announced that the 2015 and 2016 MacBook Pro models could run macOS Monterey, but this year they’re out! The 2017 models arrived in July 2017 and had Kaby Lake (7th-gen) processors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac mini models from 2018 or later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple didn’t update the Mac mini for a number of years, so chances are there aren’t that many of the 2014 models still in use, but if you have one it won’t be supported by Ventura. If you have one of the Space Gray models from 2018, or the practically identical 2020 models, you will be able to run Ventura. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac models from 2017 or later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Monterey was available on the 2015 iMac, but you’re out of luck if that’s what you have and you want to run Ventura. For Ventura only the mid 2017 (Kaby Lake or 7th gen), 2019 (Coffee Lake or 8th-gen), 2020 (Comet Lake or 10th-gen), and 2021 (M1) models are supported. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac Pro (all models)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iMac Pro was only introduced in 2017, then it was discontinued earlier in 2021. At least it is supported by Ventura.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Pro models from 2019</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Mac Pro model that’s supported is the 2019 ‘cheese grater’ workstation. If you’ve got one of the older aluminum towers or even the black cylinder ‘trash can’ then you won’t be able to run Ventura on it.</p>\n\nMac, MacBook, MacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"55b6239961db38a721cd146410d1028b2fc05616100042b39ef180313891d545","category":"Apple"}
