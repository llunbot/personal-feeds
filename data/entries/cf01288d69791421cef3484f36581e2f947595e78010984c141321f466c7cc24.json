It also allows OpenAI to use Condé content to train future AI language models. The deal covers well-known Condé brands such as Vogue, The New Yorker, GQ, Wired, Ars Technica, and others. Financial details were not disclosed.</p>\n\n<p>One immediate effect of the deal will be that users of ChatGPT or SearchGPT will now be able to see information from Condé Nast publications pulled from those assistants' live views of the web. For example, a user could ask ChatGPT, \"What's the latest Ars Technica article about Space?\" and ChatGPT can browse the web and pull up the result, attribute it, and summarize it for users while also linking to the site.</p>\n<p>In the longer term, the deal also means that OpenAI can openly and officially utilize Condé Nast articles to train future AI language models, which includes successors to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/\">GPT-4o</a>. In this case, \"training\" means feeding content into an AI model's neural network so the AI model can better process conceptual relationships.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044379#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044379&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cf01288d69791421cef3484f36581e2f947595e78010984c141321f466c7cc24","category":"Tech"}
