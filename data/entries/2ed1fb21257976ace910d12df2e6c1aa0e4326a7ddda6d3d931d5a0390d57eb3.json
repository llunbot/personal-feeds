Homer Hilsen a “country bike” because it’s between a too-skinny/ techy modern road bike and a gonzo-bozo techy mountain bike. But if you ride on roads exclusively, dirt or bitumen, it’s a pure road bike, with no compromises. Its ability to fit tires to 43mm with fenders and a rack or two doesn’t detract from its roadiness AT ALL. It is the most versatile, useful road bike Riv makes or can even imagine.  </p>\n<p>Since the first Homers in 2006 (or so) Riv has offered it in Homer Blue, and now alongside, the brand introduces a lovely Mustard Pearl. </p>\n<p>These are in stock and shipping today from <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/homer?mc_cid=fc090b596c&amp;mc_eid=081ebe17bd\" target=\"_blank\">Rivendell</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A6903_1080x.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A6903_1080x.jpg?w=1080&amp;quality=75 1080w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A6903_1080x.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A6903_1080x.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A6903_1080x.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A7124_1080x.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A7124_1080x.jpg?w=1080&amp;quality=75 1080w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A7124_1080x.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A7124_1080x.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/0A6A7124_1080x.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://hmpl.ca/collections/all-products?page=3\" target=\"_blank\">HMPL Basket Bag – Wald 137/139/Pelago Rasket</a> $132/$140/$136</h3>\n<p>Very simple yet oh so effective.

This adapter allows you to mount a post-mount disk brake on a flat-mount fork. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These particular adapters allow you to mount post-mount disc brakes onto flat-mount forks. They come in either 20mm or 0mm sizes. To figure out what size adapter you need, first find out what size rotor the fork was designed for. For instance, if the fork was designed for a 160mm rotor, and that’s the size rotor you’re using, you’ll use the 0mm adapter. If you’d like to bump up to a 180mm rotor on that same fork, you’ll want the 20mm adapter. Bigger rotors=more stopping power, so opt for the bigger rotor if you have the option.</p>\n<p>Opt in at <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/mounting-solutions/disc-adapter/front-post-mount-to-flat-mount-adapter/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Engineering</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://graveladventurefieldguide.com/spc-huerfano-co\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel Adventure Field Guide: Spanish Peaks Country</a></h3>\n<p>Southeastern Colorado is increasingly expanding its notoriety for being an extraordinary gravel bike destination.
