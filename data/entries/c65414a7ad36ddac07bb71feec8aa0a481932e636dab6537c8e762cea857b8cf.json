Very few exhibitors at the show started out making super high-end dream bikes. For the vast majority, there has been significant time spent learning their skill sets—tinkering in the basement, back room of a bike shop, garage, or even a kitchen— making things work and assembling parts against their will to create a personal bike or one for a friend that just works really well. A zero- pressure build that’s just for fun.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-01.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-01.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>BESPOKED is designed to showcase the very best work to a growing international audience. The BESPOKED Apocalypse Build-Off, however, is an invitation to play—to reconnect with a special kind of creativity that thrives within the confines of limitations. A space where, within those limitations, you can be freaks and just have fun.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-05.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-05.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-02.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-02.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For the cost of 10 weekend passes to the show, we’re offering independent bike shops a pre-built, branded plinth and bike stand on the viewing platform of the main hall at Victoria Baths, as well as 10 tickets to the show to give to customers and staff—to come and support you and hang out for a fun weekend that genuinely celebrates makers and cycling culture.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-06.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Bespoked_UK_Apocalypse-Build-Off-06.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://leafcycles.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Leafcycles</a> BESPOKED Dresden 2023, Photographer – Adam Gasson</em></p>\n<p>The Build-Off is also open to exhibitors at the show, who will be offered a plinth and free entry into the competition.
