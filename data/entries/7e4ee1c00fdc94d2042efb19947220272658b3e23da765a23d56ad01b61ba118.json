Its lawyer Timothy Otty earlier this\nmonth said that the market investigation should have been opened\nlast June at the same time the CMA published a report on mobile\necosystems, which found the two tech giants had an “effective\nduopoly.”</p>\n\n<p>The CAT endorsed Apple’s argument, saying that in declining to\ntake action at that time only in the expectation of receiving\nfurther powers it might well be said that the CMA “erred in law”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems like a technicality, but still, in my opinion, the correct result.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/31/apple-uk-mobile-browser\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e4ee1c00fdc94d2042efb19947220272658b3e23da765a23d56ad01b61ba118","category":"Tech"}
