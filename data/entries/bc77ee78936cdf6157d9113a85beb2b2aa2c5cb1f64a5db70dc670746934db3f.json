In return, Google likely offered the cloud providers cash or discounts to join, Alaily alleged.</p>\n<p>The Open Cloud Coalition is just one part of a \"pattern of shadowy campaigns\" that Google has funded, both \"directly and indirectly,\" to muddy the antitrust waters, Alaily alleged. The only other named example that Alaily gives while documenting this supposed pattern is the US-based Coalition for Fair Software Licensing (CFSL), which Alaily said has attacked Microsoft's cloud computing business in the US, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/google-accused-of-shadow-campaigns-redirecting-antitrust-scrutiny-to-microsoft/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/google-accused-of-shadow-campaigns-redirecting-antitrust-scrutiny-to-microsoft/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc77ee78936cdf6157d9113a85beb2b2aa2c5cb1f64a5db70dc670746934db3f","category":"Tech"}
