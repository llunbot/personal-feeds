How do you keep a grass field vibrant in such a hostile growing environment like the Nevada desert?</p>\n<p>The answer: You don’t. By the end of the regular NFL season, paint was used to camouflage the reality that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CadeBuffalow/status/1744132354757767550\">only a few scant patches of grass remained</a> in Allegiant Stadium, home to the Las Vegas Raiders. Immediately after the Raiders’ last game on January 7, 2024, the field crew <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPappas23/status/1744716334200770785\">ripped up the remaining grass</a>, installed <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/football/super-bowl/raiders-ridiculed-field-gets-face-lift-for-super-bowl-2980723/\">California-grown sod</a> over three days, and began the tedious process of keeping the grass alive long enough for the big game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/grass-guides/story-behind-super-bowl-grass/\">Herculean efforts</a> to prepare a vibrant natural grass field for 2024’s Super Bowl LVIII are especially questionable when one realizes that Allegiant Stadium also has an <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/stadium/raiders-natural-grass-field-moves-inside-ahead-of-game-day-2106572/\">artificial turf playing surface available</a> (used by UNLV Football). Why don’t teams in hostile environments switch to more robust artificial turf, which is designed to overcome the many limitations of natural grass fields?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002220#p3\">Read 46 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002220&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00e2e4a8bdad03bf47114aaa1f48c89d0a3ead729225a4d09370de4fc398b66c","category":"Tech"}
