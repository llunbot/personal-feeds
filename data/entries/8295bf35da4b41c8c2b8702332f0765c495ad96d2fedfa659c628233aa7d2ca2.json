And that may be less than ideal for keeping people healthy.</p>\n<h2>Swabbing the space decks</h2>\n<p>Monitoring microbial life on the ISS is an ongoing effort, and studies of this sort have been done before, although at a much smaller scale. “Previous studies used a low number of samples that could not identify all microbial and chemical factors present up there,” said Nina Zhao, a researcher at the UCSD and co-author of the study.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-space-station-is-nearly-as-microbe-free-as-an-isolation-ward/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-space-station-is-nearly-as-microbe-free-as-an-isolation-ward/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8295bf35da4b41c8c2b8702332f0765c495ad96d2fedfa659c628233aa7d2ca2","category":"Tech"}
