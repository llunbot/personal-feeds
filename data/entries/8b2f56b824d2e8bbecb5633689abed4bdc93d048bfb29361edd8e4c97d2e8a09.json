The second edition of the race, which runs from 23<sup>rd</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> July, will depart from Clermont-Ferrand and finish with an individual time-trial in Pau.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eight-stage race is typically only available to view with a paid subscription for those in the UK, but Lifeplus-Wahoo is committed to making watching the Tour de France Femmes more accessible, thereby increasing the exposure of women’s cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want a free pass? <a href=\"https://lifepluswahoo.com/embraceeverymoment\" target=\"_blank\">Head here</a> and don’t hang about, as it’s first come, first served.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free passes come courtesy of the team’s title sponsors, Wahoo and the wellness brand Lifeplus. British riders April Tacey and Natalie Grinczer will be among the Lifeplus-Wahoo line-up on the start line before joining the peloton in covering 956km through southern France and into the Pyrenees, scaling such hallowed ascents as the Col d’Aspin and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-tour-de-france-climbs-col-du-tourmalet\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Tourmalet</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifeplus-Wahoo, then known as Le Col-Wahoo, ran a similar giveaway for last year’s inaugural Tour de France Femmes. The race was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-review\" target=\"_blank\">won by Annemiek van Vleuten</a>, with Le Col-Wahoo rider Maike van der Duin finished sixth on the Stage 1 and fifth on both Stage 2 and Stage 5.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-tour-de-france-femmes\">How to watch the Tour de France Femmes 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/le-col-wahoo-women-s-tour\">Behind the scenes with Le Col-Wahoo at the Women’s Tour</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Tour de France Femmes 2023: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>In announcing the pass giveaway, Lifeplus-Wahoo manager Tom Varney said, ‘We’re so excited to be bringing this campaign back again for the Tour de France Femmes in 2023.
