On its last earnings call in August, Apple said it expected its fourth quarter revenue to grow at a rate similar to its third quarter, which would mean around 5% growth on a year-over-year basis. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/apple-4q-2023-results/\">reported $89.5 billion revenue</a> in the year-ago quarter, so a 5% increase to that would equal around $94 billion, which would be a fourth-quarter record for Apple.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">Earnings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-earnings-on-halloween/\">Trick or Treat?
