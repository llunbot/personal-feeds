A <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-plus-vr-subscription-service-introductory-offer/\">blog post</a> on Meta's website confirmed the details shortly afterward.</p>\n<p>The service, Meta Quest+, will cost $7.99 per month, or $59.99 annually. For that, subscribers can download two curated VR games for free each month. In this first month, the games are <em>Pistol Whip</em>, a critically and commercially successful 2019 shooter from Cloudhead Games, and 2020's <em>Pixel Ripped 1995</em>, a retro-themed experience wherein players relive experiences endemic to the 1990s in low-poly VR.</p>\n<p>Meta is positioning the service as a way to reduce the browsing and guesswork about which games to buy so users can \"browse less\" and \"play more,\" suggesting that the goal here is to curate the very best of what's available on Meta's VR game marketplace.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949971#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949971&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8c9557d6ccdee3d4c5513597f47514f80a199c0be7fe454c759631d740059c0","category":"Tech"}
