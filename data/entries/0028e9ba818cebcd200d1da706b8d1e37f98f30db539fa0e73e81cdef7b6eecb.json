Samsung's Smart Monitor M8 has a design very similar to the new 24-inch iMacs, and it uses USB-C charging connectivity and includes AirPlay support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://howl.me/cjmDFwN7wbh\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$250 OFF</div>Samsung Smart Monitor M8 for $449.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnly the Warm White color is available at this low price, while all others are seeing a $549.99 price tag. Compared to past sales, this is the best price we've seen on the Smart Monitor M8 so far in 2023, and is an overall second-best price when looking at sales from the 2022 holiday season.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M8 houses a 4K UHD flat LCD panel providing 400 nits of brightness, a 60Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and adaptive picture technology that automatically adjusts display brightness and color temperature for viewing comfort. The M8 chassis is 11.4mm thin, which is 0.1mm thinner than Apple's iMac, and it includes a flat back, thin bezels, and a height adjustable stand with tilt functionality. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntegrated into the display is Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2 wireless connectivity, one micro HDMI port, and two USB-C ports one of which offers 65W of charging output for a phone and notebook. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/odyssey-ark-samsung.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBesides the Smart Monitor M8, we've rounded up a few other items you can get on sale during the Discover Samsung event.
