The original HomePod was announced at WWDC on June 5, 2017, but didn’t ship until the following February. However, that’s still eight full years of support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230983/apple-homepod-review.html\">original HomePod</a> was discontinued in March 2021, it’s not all that different from the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1509062/homepod-2023-review.html\">2nd-gen model</a> that arrived in January 2023. The design and sound are very similar despite the older model having two extra tweeters, and they have many of the same features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main difference is the processor. The original model has an A8 from the iPhone 6, while the 2nd-gen model is powered by the S7 chip in the Apple Watch Series 7. Notably, Apple ended support for the iPhone 6 with iOS 12, which was released in 2018. However, HomePod software is much less processor-dependent than iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There haven’t been any rumors about new HomePod features, but Apple is rumored to be working on a new HomePod with a display that acts as a smart home hub. Apple could also bring some Apple Intelligence features to the HomePod speaker when using an iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will announce HomePod Software 26 at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on Monday at 10 a.m. PT.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cc752beba58cfe682241225035694e055d3b5471cd669b8681830a34049c1e03","category":"Apple"}
