The earliest Arc products will be released in \"the first quarter of 2022\" and will be based on a GPU codenamed \"Alchemist,\" a new, more memorable codename for a GPU previously known as \"DG2.\"</p>\n\n<p>The first Arc cards will be a follow-up of sorts to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/intel-releases-dg1-discrete-graphics-cards-to-oems-and-integrators/\">DG1</a>—a card released only to system builders—which performs a lot like the GDDR5 version of Nvidia's aging, low-end GeForce GTX 1030. We don't have spec sheets for any of the Alchemist-based Arc cards yet, but the trailer Intel showed confirmed support for modern GPU features like real-time ray tracing and \"AI Accelerated Super Sampling\" that will compete with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/linux-gamers-to-get-nvidia-dlss-on-some-proton-games/\">Nvidia's DLSS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-fidelityfx\">AMD's FidelityFX</a> upscaling technologies. The trailer also showed Arc silicon running real (if somewhat older) games like <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em>.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate its commitment to the discrete GPU market, Intel announced several more GPU codenames that will succeed Alchemist in the coming years, including \"Battlemage,\" \"Celestial,\" and \"Druid\" (note both the alphabetical order and the high-fantasy theme).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787430#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787430&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4fe703a7f74fa577575ceb45139b0394fc0e8041d1ec18695bf9879ff08d9b07","category":"Tech"}
