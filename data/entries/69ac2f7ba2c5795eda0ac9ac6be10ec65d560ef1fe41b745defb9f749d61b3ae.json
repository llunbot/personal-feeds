{"title":"Devin Coldewey on Amazon Killing DPReview","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/21/amazon-kills-dpreview-the-best-camera-review-site-on-the-web/","date":1679611795000,"content":"\n<p>Devin Coldewey, writing at TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The team’s knowledge, acumen and extensive objective testing\ncontributed to reviews that famously reached near-comical lengths\nat times, but that was because shortcuts simply were not taken:\nYou could be sure that even minor models were getting not just a\nfair shake, but the same treatment a flagship model received. <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/products/cameras/all\">Its\nback catalog of camera reviews and specs</a> is an incredible\nresource that I have consulted hundreds of times. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Somehow Amazon never really found a way to capitalize on this\none-of-a-kind asset, and DPReview has carried on over the years\nmore or less untouched, to the point where it seems possible its\nparent company forgot they owned them. It’s hard not to see the\nopportunities that present themselves when you own one of the\nworld’s leading expert voices on a major category, but perhaps\nunsurprisingly, no one thought to invest in and integrate DPReview\nclosely with Amazon’s other properties. It isn’t the first time\nthe left hand and right hand have been incommunicado at that\ncompany.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite being a very longtime devotee of DPReview, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/22/amazon-layoffs-dpreview\">as I noted yesterday</a>, I actually never noticed (or, perhaps, long ago forgot) that Amazon had acquired them in 2007. That acquisition didn’t change the content or quality of DPReview’s coverage at all — they certainly didn’t turn into a shill, just trying to sell kit available at Amazon.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/23/coldeway-dpreview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"69ac2f7ba2c5795eda0ac9ac6be10ec65d560ef1fe41b745defb9f749d61b3ae","category":"Tech"}
