Thanks to the release of its Black Friday circular recently, now we have a clear picture of all the deals you'll see if you choose to shop Target on Black Friday.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Target's Black Friday Schedule</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nLike other stores, Target's event is more of a week of sales rather than just one day. The retailer kicks things off on Sunday, November 21, and deals will come in and out all the way through Saturday, November 27. This means that you'll be able to get a lot of shopping done ahead of the 26th, but there will be a few deals available only on that day.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li>Sunday, November 21 - Online sales begin</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Thursday, November 25 - Stores closed, online sales continue</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Friday, November 26 - Specific opening hours vary by location</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Target Black Friday - Deals Start 11/21</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThere are quite a few solid deals across numerous product categories at Target this year, although many do overlap with other retailers as well.
