Which is why large team mechanics may want it, too, especially considering Sinter claims the result is not just faster setup, but also better braking performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For shops, getting disc brakes properly bedded in is a great customer service. Doing it in just 10 minutes is a big time savings, and it keeps employees from having to roll a bike out of the shop to do a bed-in procedure in the parking lot…which can take a while. And what if it’s raining?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sinter-smart-bedding-matchine-professional-brake-pad-bedding-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sinter-smart-bedding-matchine-professional-brake-pad-bedding-3-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of control screen on sinter smart bedding machine\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sinter-smart-bedding-matchine-professional-brake-pad-bedding-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sinter-smart-bedding-matchine-professional-brake-pad-bedding-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sinter-smart-bedding-matchine-professional-brake-pad-bedding-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sinter-smart-bedding-matchine-professional-brake-pad-bedding-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sinter-smart-bedding-matchine-professional-brake-pad-bedding-3.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The device spins a bicycle’s wheel at up to 15mph on two aluminum rollers. It fits anything from 20″ to 29″ wheels, and 1″ to 3″ wide tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A guide tells the mechanic which mode to use based on the brake type and rotor size, and then they simply press down on the bike while the machine works. Once it starts, it also guides them on how much pressure to apply to the levers and for how long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It reverses direction based on which tire you’re bedding in, so they’re always rolling in the correct direction. With a minimal footprint, it’s a good addition to any shop’s toolkit, especially one that performs the service on new bike builds. MSRP is $1,750 USD. For North America, Sinter is now available through BTI via Unior USA, and (for consumables, anyway) Trek’s retail network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sinter.si\" target=\"_blank\">Sinter.si</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sinter-smart-bedding-machine-promises-20-better-braking-performance/\">Sinter Smart Bedding Machine Promises 20% Better Braking Performance</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ec064fff6581a37367eedcccf70943af9f88b3b1e65f744846f25d194f713c23","category":"Cycling"}
