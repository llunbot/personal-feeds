McLaren must have been thinking about that question when it came time to give the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/fast-friendly-and-fun-we-test-the-mclaren-720s-spider/\">already rather good 720S</a> a bit of a midlife refresh. The answer is more power, less weight, and a raft of updates here and there that make the new McLaren 750S more useable but also even better on track, if that's your thing.</p>\n<p>Starting from a standard configuration, a 750S weighs 3,062 lbs (1,388 kg), 66 lbs (30 kg) less than the car it's replacing. But if you select the right combination of options, from single-piece carbon fiber racing seats to titanium wheel bolts, you can trim that down even further—McLaren says to as little as 2,815 lbs (1,277 kg), but that's a dry weight.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the all-carbon fiber construction results in a car that's both very stiff and lighter than the competition. And the penalty for switching to a retractable hardtop roof is just 108 lbs (50 kg), although it does bring the car's center of gravity up a smidge.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984019#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984019&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
