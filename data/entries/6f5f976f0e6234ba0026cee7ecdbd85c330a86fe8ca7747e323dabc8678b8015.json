This is her story, cycling through five continents, 28 countries, and 29,000 kilometers by way of Africa, South America, Europe, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>\n<p>A voyage of both the outer and inner worlds, poetic narration is interwoven with stunning landscapes from around our planet and misadventures along the way: dodging a spear in Kenya, being stuck in a military coup in Sudan, narrowly escaping a wild African ambush in Botswana, crossing the Australian outback and the world’s largest salt flats in Bolivia. Entirely and intentionally self-made by the adventurer from script to screen, Cycling The World is a raw and visceral account of what happens when you tackle a big, audacious goal that terrifies you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cyclingtheworldfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cyclingtheworldfilm.com</a></p>\n<p>Filmmaker’s Instagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/mckenziebarney\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/mckenziebarney</a><br />\nFilmmaker’s Website: <a href=\"http://www.mckenziebarneystudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mckenziebarneystudio.com</a></p>\n<p>**Book Coming Soon**</p>\n<p>Thanks to our Film Tour partners: Patagonia, Kona, Rapha, Big Agnes, Tailfin, Bedrock, Ombraz, Oveja Negra, Revelate Designs, Swift Industries, Adventure Cycling Association</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/video-cycling-the-world/\">VIDEO: Cycling the World</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"6f5f976f0e6234ba0026cee7ecdbd85c330a86fe8ca7747e323dabc8678b8015","category":"Cycling"}
