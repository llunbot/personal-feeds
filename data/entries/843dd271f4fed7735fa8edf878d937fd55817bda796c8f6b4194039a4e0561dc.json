The second beta comes two weeks after Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-seeds-first-macos-monterey-public-beta/\">first macOS Monterey public beta</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/macos-monterey-tidbits-feature-copy.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPublic beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">Apple's beta software website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices, and it's now possible to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> directly to a Mac from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari has an updated tab bar and support for Tab Groups to keep tons of tabs organized, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> now features support for spatial audio, Portrait Mode (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs only) and Voice Isolation for cutting out background noise. A SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature lets <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, another new feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and the Shortcuts app is now available on the Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA dedicated Focus mode helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions based on what's going on, and there's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features. With Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected. There are many other new features in ‌‌macOS Monterey‌‌, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">complete overview</a> available in our ‌macOS Monterey‌ roundup. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the developer beta that corresponds to the second public beta, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">changed the default design</a> of the Safari tab bar following multiple usability complaints. There's now a dedicated address bar at the top of the Safari window, with tabs arranged below it, rather than an all-in-one integrated design. Those who preferred the original design can use the View menu to toggle off \"Show Separate Tab Bar.\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/16/apple-releases-macos-monterey-public-beta-2/\">Apple Releases Second Public Beta of macOS 12 Monterey</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-second-public-beta-of-macos-12-monterey.2304470/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=R0n8ey3sEY8:FOuImTZcxyU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=R0n8ey3sEY8:FOuImTZcxyU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/R0n8ey3sEY8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"843dd271f4fed7735fa8edf878d937fd55817bda796c8f6b4194039a4e0561dc","category":"Apple"}
