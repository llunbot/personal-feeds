However, that could change in the not too distant future, as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman this week said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/25/face-id-for-mac-couple-of-years/\">Face ID is coming to the Mac within a \"couple of years.\"</a>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/FaceID-iMac-REREREREMIX.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nGurman believes that Apple's ultimate goal is to shift most of its product lineup to Face ID, including lower-end iPhone models such as the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, both of which currently feature Touch ID.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Tesla CEO Elon Musk Takes Shots at Apple During Earnings Call</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn an earnings call this month, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/elon-musk-apple-sniping-tesla-call/\">Tesla CEO Elon Musk made some pointed comments about Apple's so-called \"walled garden\"</a> and the company's use of the rare-earth element cobalt, which has been associated with human rights issues like forced child labor and environmental concerns near mining sites.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/06/REC_ASA_CODE2016-20160601-205816-2745.1464846118.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLater in the week, Musk came out to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-on-apple-app-store-fees/\">publicly back Epic Games in its dispute with Apple</a>, calling Apple's App Store \"a de facto global tax on the Internet.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn crazier Musk news, a new book about Tesla claims that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-wanting-to-become-apple-ceo/\">Musk demanded he be named Apple CEO</a> in a brief phone discussion with Tim Cook about a potential acquisition of Tesla by Apple.
