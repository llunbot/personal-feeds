Foxconn assembles Apple devices including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and MacBook. The supplier is currently helping Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/new-iphone-starts-production-outside-china/\">shift some iPhone assembly to India</a> as the company looks to diversify its global supply chain.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWilliams last visited Taiwan in 2017 for TSMC's 30th anniversary celebrations. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> has not visited Taiwan since 2008. Williams spearheaded development of the Apple Watch and Apple's various health initiatives. He now oversees many vital areas of the company, including hardware and software design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWilliams is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/11/report-outlines-apple-senior-executive-successors/\">the frontrunner to succeed Cook</a> as Apple's CEO. He is apparently \"seen as the heir apparent\" within the company, having run Apple's global operations under Cook's leadership, a role that Cook previously undertook for Steve Jobs prior to becoming CEO himself.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-williams/\">Jeff Williams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/jeff-williams-visits-taiwan/\">Apple COO Jeff Williams Visits Taiwan to Celebrate 50 Years of Foxconn</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-coo-jeff-williams-visits-taiwan-to-celebrate-50-years-of-foxconn.2419939/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f8399524c54266fe3513c93b64785607275fc340c298a75b0bc8ed7e6bcecbd5","category":"Apple"}
