However, due to a series of problems, including software errors, the lander crashed into the gray and lonely lunar surface during its final descent. This failure hit a sore spot for the country, which takes pride in its burgeoning space program and its growing list of achievements.</p>\n<p>Now, there is a lot of national fervor behind <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/after-russias-failure-india-is-next-in-line-to-attempt-a-moon-landing/\">India's second attempt to land on the Moon</a>, with a spacecraft called Chandrayaan 3. After launching in mid-July, the spacecraft's Vikram lander is due to attempt a soft touchdown at 8:34 am ET (12:34 UTC) on Wednesday. Success is far from guaranteed, especially after Russia's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/russia-seems-to-have-lost-contact-with-its-first-lunar-probe-in-half-a-century/\">Luna 25 spacecraft crashed</a> into the Moon this past weekend.</p>\n<p>It was, therefore, perhaps inadvisable that a well-known Indian actor and politician named Prakash Raj <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prakashraaj/status/1693280942012698805\">took to the social media network</a> formerly known as Twitter this weekend to share an image and comment, \"BREAKING NEWS:- First picture coming from the Moon by #VikramLander Wowww #justasking\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962451#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962451&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eadb42758f1f35452588c9c25b2806a8f53bcac1fb4afac49130191f86af16d0","category":"Tech"}
