These bricks can help mitigate the negative effects of traditional brick manufacturing, an energy-intensive process that requires large-scale clay mining, contributes heavily to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and generates a lot of air pollution.</p>\n<p>According to the RMIT researchers, “Brick kilns worldwide consume 375 million tonnes (~340 million metric tons) of coal in combustion annually, which is equivalent to 675 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emission (~612 million metric tons).” This exceeds the combined annual carbon dioxide emissions of 130 million passenger vehicles in the US.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/these-bricks-are-like-lego-for-full-sized-buildings/\">energy-smart bricks</a> rely on a material called RCF waste. It mostly contains fine pieces of glass (92 percent) left over from the recycling process, along with ceramic materials, plastic, paper, and ash. Most of this <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/11/global-waste-production-to-triple-by-2100-led-by-sub-saharan-africa/\">waste material</a> generally ends up in landfills, where it can cause soil and water degradation. However, the study authors <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061823037492?via%3Dihub\">note</a>, “The utilization of RCF waste in fired-clay bricks offers a potential solution to the increasing global waste crisis and reduces the burden on landfills.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033291#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033291&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"17a9dccb2e3765a28ec8d88cef785eb124b94c639d2d53102804cebdad7d9c43","category":"Tech"}
