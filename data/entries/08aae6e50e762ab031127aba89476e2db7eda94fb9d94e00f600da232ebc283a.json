The server project, which is internally code-named\nProject ACDC — for Apple Chips in Data Center — will bring this\ntalent to bear for the company’s servers, according to people\nfamiliar with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Project ACDC has been in the works for several years and it is\nuncertain when the new chip will be unveiled, if ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another rebuttal to the whole “Apple is behind on AI” discourse. Apple is just doing things their own way, at their own pace, and they’re not going to talk about any of it in advance. Custom chip development is slow, expensive, and indicates an extreme commitment.</p>\n\n<p>As for the “ACDC” codename, if I didn’t know any better, I’d half wonder <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site:https://www.loopinsight.com+ac/dc\">if Jim Dalrymple took a job on Apple’s silicon team</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/08/wsj-apple-acdc\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"08aae6e50e762ab031127aba89476e2db7eda94fb9d94e00f600da232ebc283a","category":"Tech"}
