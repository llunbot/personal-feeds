On Tuesday a jury in California found that Autopilot <a href=\"https://epublic-access.riverside.courts.ca.gov/public-portal/?q=node/385/1605785\">was not to blame</a> for a 2019 crash in Riverside County that killed the driver and left his wife and son severely injured. That marks <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/tesla-beats-autopilot-lawsuit-as-jury-rejects-crash-victims-claim/\">the second time this year</a> a jury has found that Autopilot was not responsible for a serious crash.</p>\n<p>The case was filed by the two survivors of the Riverside crash and alleged that an Autopilot malfunction caused Micah Lee's Tesla Model 3 to veer off a highway at 65 mph (105 km/h) before it struck a tree and burst into flames. Lee died in the crash, and his wife and then-8-year-old son <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-wins-autopilot-trial-involving-fatal-crash-2023-10-31/\">were seriously injured</a>; as a result the plaintiffs asked for $400 million plus punitive damages.</p>\n<p>But Tesla denied Autopilot was defective and claimed that Lee had been drinking alcohol before the crash. Nine members of the jury agreed with Tesla after four days of deliberation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980233#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980233&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
