Today, they’re launching two! First up is the new Gravelier, a saddle for… you guessed it, gravel. Following the trend of shorter saddles, the Gravelier gets a short &amp; wide design with plenty of options and details to keep you comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"WTB Gravelier saddle first impressions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2456-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring 246mm in length, the Gravelier is on the shorter side, but with a wide, padded nose for support when riding on the nose. Only offered in a 140mm width, the saddle is considered medium width and includes three different padding types. The higher end models feature the WTB DNA padding for long miles, while the Stainless Steel rail version gets the DNAx, a light weight polyurethane foam that is a little softer to the touch. The base Chromoly version gets their HLX padding which is the most plush. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That padding is shaped with the help of pressure mapping data from gravel riders and racers to make the most comfortable form. WTB states that gravel riders tend to ride with a forward-leaning posture that puts unwanted pressure on the perineal region. To improve comfort, the Gravelier has a perineal relief cutout, and a tapered nose to eliminate pressure. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Gravelier saddle ti rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-11-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Gravelier saddle carbon rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-4.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Images c.

Fusion Form allows them to “fine-tune the amount of fiber infused into the nylon of each specific saddle model to create a flex profile that balances comfort, support and durability to match the intended use of a saddle.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Gravelier saddle bottom\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-12-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Image c. WTB</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wanting to make sure riders could position the saddle where they need it, the Gravelier has extended flat sections of the rails for an increased clamp range. Underneath, you’ll also find an integrated mount for tools and existing on-bike storage to take advantage of products from brands like PRO. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"WTB Gravelier saddle first impressions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2457-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the Gravelier couldn’t have shown up at a better time. I had a gravel bike in for review that desperately needed a different saddle, and this one was perfect for the task. I generally get along fairly well with WTB saddles, and this one is no different. I was almost instantly at home with minor adjustments. I was able to quickly hop on and knock out my longest ride of the season without any complaints. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m hopping to get more miles on the saddle before rendering a final verdict, but first impressions are <em>very</em> favorable. Also, don’t let the name pigeonhole this saddle for gravel duty – it seems like it would be an excellent road or all-road saddle as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WTB Gravelier Saddle Actual Weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Gravelier saddle carbon actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-3.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Gravelier saddle titanium actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTB-Gravelier-saddle-carbon-titanium-actual-weight-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WTB sent out the carbon and the titanium rail versions, which both weighed in at less than claimed.
