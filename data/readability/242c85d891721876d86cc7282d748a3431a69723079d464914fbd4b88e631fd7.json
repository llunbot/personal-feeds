Now, Specialized has taken much of what they learned from the Jett project and have used it to create a new line of purpose-built mountain bikes called the Riprock.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103240/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103240/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-12.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Riprock kids mountain bike\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103240/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-12.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103240/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-12-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103240/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-12-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103240/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-12-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103240/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-12-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104045/Specialized-Riprock-geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104045/Specialized-Riprock-geometry.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Riprock 2022 geometry\" width=\"674\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104045/Specialized-Riprock-geometry.jpg 674w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104045/Specialized-Riprock-geometry-297x242.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104045/Specialized-Riprock-geometry-120x98.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\"></a></p><p>Meant to be a true first “trail bike”, the Riprock includes many of the features you’ll find on adult bikes—but proportionately sized. That includes what Specialized is calling modern geometry, which for a kid isn’t terribly different. The Head tube angle is a reasonable 68° or slacker 67° with a suspension fork, and seat tube angles are all 74°.</p><p>Sizing is based around the wheel size with a 20″ and two 24″ models. That means there are bikes to fit riders between 4-12 years old, and between 42″ and 56″ in height.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103333/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-26.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103333/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-26.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Riprock 130mm saddle\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103333/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-26.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103333/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-26-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103333/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-26-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103333/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-26-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103333/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-26-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103155/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103155/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-4.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Riprock 1x drivetrain\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103155/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-4.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103155/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103155/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103155/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103155/Specialized-RipRock-kids-mountain-bike-20-24-inch-wheels-suspension-4-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>More importantly, though, component sizing has been influenced by their Retul findings.
