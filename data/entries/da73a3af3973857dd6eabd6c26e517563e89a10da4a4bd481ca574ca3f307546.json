Not small things, but things that Sonos enthusiasts would really notice: sleep timers, local music library access and management, playlist and song queue editing, plus accessibility downgrades.</p>\n<p>In May, a Sonos executive told The Verge that it \"takes courage to rebuild a brand’s core product from the ground up, and to do so knowing it may require taking a few steps back to ultimately leap into the future.\" You might ask if bravery could have been mustered to not release an app before it was feature-complete.</p>\n<p>Now, nearly three months after shipping, Sonos leadership has pivoted from excitement about future innovations to humility, apology, and a detailed roadmap of fixes. CEO Patrick Spence starts his \"Update on the Sonos app from Patrick\" with a personal apology, a note that \"there isn’t an employee at Sonos who isn’t pained by having let you down,\" and a pledge that fixing the app is the No. 1 priority.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039296#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039296&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da73a3af3973857dd6eabd6c26e517563e89a10da4a4bd481ca574ca3f307546","category":"Tech"}
