They appeared in the seas over half a billion years ago and have maintained to the present day the comb-like rows of cilia they used to move around. Their transparent bodies and internal bioluminescence give them looks that rival gaming computers. But there’s something that makes them even weirder.</p>\n<p>When a comb jelly is injured, it can regenerate at an amazing rate. But it can also attach a body part of another injured comb jelly and integrate it near-seamlessly into its own body. (Those who have played <em>Elden Ring</em> can enjoy comparisons to Godrick The Grafted.)</p>\n<p>“I’ve been observing ctenophores for a long time, so it was easy to spot an unusually large specimen. Some of the anatomical features were doubled, so I realized what I’m looking at is actually two individuals that have fused together,” said Kei Jokura, a marine researcher at the University of Exeter and lead author of a recent Current Biology paper on the integration of fused ctenophores.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/injured-comb-jellies-can-fuse-into-a-single-organism/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/injured-comb-jellies-can-fuse-into-a-single-organism/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ddf531cea50b43b91da964bd136631f7a9e6c983222f1872c13b9200c778873c","category":"Tech"}
