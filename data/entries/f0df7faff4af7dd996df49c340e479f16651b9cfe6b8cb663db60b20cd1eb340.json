Sure, there have been a few little announcements from the bling specialists, like a cool <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/updated-wolf-tooth-components-bike-tire-pressure-app-2-0/\" target=\"_blank\">tire pressure </a>app, and some <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-components-universal-derailleur-hanger-udh-replacement-color/\" target=\"_blank\">small finishing parts</a>. But, WTC says that this announcement is the first of four big announcements.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Bottom Brackets first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-first-pic-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Wolf Tooth Components)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These will be showing up and officially launched at Sea Otter on April 10.

All the super popular features that everybody wants in their bottom brackets. They are also machined right there in Minnesota, USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Bottom Brackets spindle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-spindle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They say the weather sealing is the “best-in-class”.

This eliminates metal-on-metal contact and creaking. The new Bottom Brackets are available in multiple BSA and T47 internal sizes for maximum spindle compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Bottom Brackets line-up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Bottom-Brackets-line-up-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Wolf Tooth Components)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also available in several colors to help you get matchy-matchy with all of your other Wolf Tooth anodized bits. The new Bottom Brackets sport adjustable-width shells to allow BSA models to fit either 68mm or 73mm wide bottom bracket shells.
