{"title":"Google Search Is Already in Decline","link":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/googling-is-for-old-people-thats-a-problem-for-google-5188a6ed","date":1733181197000,"content":"\n<p>Christopher Mims, writing for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/A1Dk4WVHSSHqAaXcKL2Z03g\">News+</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The company’s core business is under siege. People are\nincreasingly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/jeff-bezos-bets-on-a-google-challenger-using-ai-to-try-to-upend-internet-search-0859bda6\">getting answers from artificial\nintelligence</a>. Younger generations are using <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-and-metas-advertising-dominance-fades-as-tiktok-netflix-emerge-11672711107\">other\nplatforms to gather information</a>. And the quality of the\nresults delivered by its search engine is deteriorating as the web\nis <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/its-the-end-of-the-web-as-we-know-it-2ab686a2\">flooded with AI-generated content</a>. Taken together,\nthese forces could lead to long-term decline in Google search\ntraffic, and the outsize profits generated from it, which prop up\nits parent company Alphabet’s money-losing bets on things like its\nWaymo self-driving unit.</p>\n\n<p>The first danger facing Google is clear and present: When people\nwant to search for information or go shopping on the internet,\nthey are shifting to Google’s competitors, and advertising dollars\nare following them. In 2025, eMarketer projects, Google’s share of\nthe U.S. search-advertising market <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/online-ad-market-google-tiktok-9599d7e8\">will fall below 50% for the\nfirst time since the company began tracking it</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/12/wsj-us-search-advertising-share.png\">The accompanying chart</a> (“Estimated share of U.S. search advertising revenue”) suggests Google’s decline has been Amazon’s gain. Basically, Google may still dominate the market for general web search, but people more and more are searching using apps and services that aren’t (or aren’t only) general web search engines. And the reason why is that Google web search has gotten worse.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/02/google-search-decline-mims\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5f78e7732f6d44d0c323388789c0d08d959da647afced72ca2de9a8c6d2f6596","category":"Tech"}
