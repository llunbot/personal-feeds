They found evidence of various species the lions had consumed, including humans.</p>\n<p>The British began construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in March 1898, with Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson leading the project. But mere days after Patterson arrived on site, workers started disappearing or being killed. The culprits: two maneless male lions, so emboldened that they often dragged workers from their tents at night to eat them. At their peak, they were killing workers almost daily—including an attack on the district officer, who narrowly escaped with claw lacerations on his back. (His assistant, however, was killed.)</p>\n<p>Patterson finally managed to shoot and kill one of the lions on December 9 and the second 20 days later. The lion pelts decorated Patterson's home as rugs for 25 years before being sold to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History in 1924. The skins were restored and used to reconstruct the lions, which are now on permanent display at the museum, along with their skulls.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/scientists-found-human-hairs-in-teeth-of-19th-century-lions/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/scientists-found-human-hairs-in-teeth-of-19th-century-lions/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"49258e3b699018a37f5e460b8feb837175e83650f27c3f2857456ed7a714323b","category":"Tech"}
