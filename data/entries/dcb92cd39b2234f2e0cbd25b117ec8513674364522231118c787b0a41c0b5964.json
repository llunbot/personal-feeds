The Body Smart can measure Basal Metabolic Rate as well, which is the number of calories that a person burns at rest. The scale also includes health measurements like standing heart rate and metabolic age.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWithings added an \"Eyes Closed Mode\" that hides weight from the scale screen for those who prefer not to look or who want to be discreet when using the scale around others. When activated, the scale will instead offer up encouraging motivating messages or daily information like step counts, air quality, and weather. In this mode, weight is still added to the Withings app so that it can be checked later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUp to eight family members can use the Body Smart, and there are built-in modes like athletic, pregnancy, and baby, so even small children can be monitored. This is Withings' lowest priced scale, and it is sold alongside the $200 Body Comp and the $300 Body Scan. The Body Comp is able to calculate vascular age, while the Body Scan includes vascular age and a 6-Lead ECG.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Body Smart can be <a href=\"https://www.withings.com/us/en/\">purchased from the Withings website</a> for $99.95.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/withings/\">Withings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/withings-body-smart-scale/\">Withings Launches New iPhone-Connected Smart Scale With 'Eyes Closed' Mode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/withings-launches-new-iphone-connected-smart-scale-with-eyes-closed-mode.2387158/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dcb92cd39b2234f2e0cbd25b117ec8513674364522231118c787b0a41c0b5964","category":"Apple"}
