The tower includes a minifig of Sauron himself, plus the <a href=\"https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Mouth_of_Sauron\">Mouth of Sauron</a>, Gollum, and a handful of Orcs.</p>\n<p>The Lego Barad-dûr set <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2024/may/the-new-lego-lego-icons-lord-of-the-rings-barad-d-r-set\">will launch</a> on June 1 for Lego Insiders and June 4 for everybody else. If you buy it between June 1 and June 7, you'll also get the \"Fell Beast\" bonus set, with pose-able wings and a Nazgûl minifig. It doesn't seem as though this bonus set will be sold separately, making it much harder to buy the nine Nazgûl you would need to make your collection story-accurate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024228#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024228&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00cb2480efe1de310489749fc33166c191b4b05f92cb1d8cb3af8bf19fd3ad9d","category":"Tech"}
