Writing in his latest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AS7Hj1mBMGM/mark-gurman\">\"Power On\" newsletter</a>, Gurman explained that a change of strategy during the update's development process has added several new features:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>When Apple set out to develop iOS 17, the initial thinking was to call it a tuneup release — one focused more on fixing bugs and improving performance than adding new features (not unlike the approach the company took with Snow Leopard on Mac OS X back in 2009). The hope was to avoid the problems of iOS 16, an ambitious update that suffered from missed deadlines and a buggy start. But later in the development process, the strategy changed. The iOS 17 release is now expected to boast several \"nice to have\" features, even if it lacks a tentpole improvement like last year's revamped lock screen. The goal of the software, codenamed \"Dawn,\" is to check off several of users' most requested features.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with previous ‌iPhone‌ software updates, ‌iOS 17‌ is expected to be previewed at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June ahead of launching in the fall. The update could offer a range of enhancements and new features, such as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/28/next-generation-carplay-features/\">next-generation CarPlay</a> experience, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/06/gurman-siri-trigger-phrase/\">changes to Siri</a>, support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/13/apple-europe-alternate-app-store-support/\">sideloading and alternate app stores</a>, support for Apple's mixed-reality headset, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/ios-17-to-provide-several-most-requested-features/\">Gurman: iOS 17 to Provide Several 'Most Requested Features'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-ios-17-to-provide-several-most-requested-features.2384828/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"173d777680310628d0908159ade79f805042fbdd04f432155a8a1f4b133cdae4","category":"Apple"}
