But “next week” came and went with no announcements made. Maybe the FT just had a bad source, or maybe there was some sort of unforeseen delay? Or maybe the EC looked at the chaos unleashed by Trump this week and figured these fines could wait another week. Or maybe they’re just recalculating the fines post-trade-war.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/05/no-eu-fines-this-week\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"92dee1394f5df2005377af5636dca262d7fc5ada5b1fdab649cc7e2203ceaf10","category":"Tech"}
