Not only does it improve riding comfort, it can even help keep your undercarriage cleaner, moisturized, and less prone to saddle sores.</p><p>Here are our favorite chamois creams, lotions, and potions for everything from short races to all-day long rides.

And while we like their basic formula, their Chamois Butt’r Coconut is our overall favorite. In addition to the standard ingredients designed to prevent chafe and provide some antiseptic properties to soothe already inflamed skin, this formula adds coconut oil and shea butter to add more moisture while reducing friction even further.</p><p>We appreciate that it easily washes out of kit after even the gnarliest of rides, and it really does make skin feel more supple after use. It even works great as an all-over lotion in a pinch. So, if you’re prone to dry skin or riding in wintery climates where windburn is a factor, this chamois cream may protect your skin better than other options.</p><ul><li>Volume: 8 ounces</li><li>MSRP: $18</li><li>Price per ounce: $2.25</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great for moisturizer, lasts long but washes out easily<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Oily skin types may find it clogs pores more than the traditional formula</p><h3>&nbsp;<span> BEST EURO-STYLE: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011F8WN96/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mad Alchemy EuroPRO Chamois Creme&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5-297x163.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5-800x440.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5-120x66.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5-768x422.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150453/mad-alchemy-euro-style-best-cycling-chamois-cream-5-1536x845.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Mad Alchemy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011F8WN96/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EuroPRO Chamois crème</a> is a “Euro style” option, which simply means that it comes in a jar and is thinner, more watery (think lotion, not cream) compared others.

(Some riders love it, some are a little concerned when their nether regions tingle!)

And the witch hazel and oak bark extract serve as helpful in-ride cleansers, keeping your skin well-protected even in the sweatiest of conditions.

Yep, that’s right: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F38WKRE/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bag Balm</a> is farm equipment that cyclists have been using to keep friction low on long rides.</p><p>If you’re doing an ultra-endurance event, this one will last all day long. The trick is to apply it thick, and directly to your skin. You can then apply any of the other creams here directly to your short’s padding for a slicker feeling.</p><p>There is a major caveat though: Bag Balm’s benefits and the reason it is so long-lasting while you’re riding is because it’s petroleum-based. And in the long term, for both your skin and your cycling shorts, that’s not a good thing. If you’re attempting something like the Leadville 100 or the 200-mile Unbound race, it makes sense, but for everyday riding, stick with something lighter.

Here’s what to consider:</p><p><strong>Application style:</strong> Some people prefer a jar of chamois cream to dip fingers in, others are more squeamish and prefer a squeeze tube to apply to the chamois or directly to the skin. Jar-based options tend to be a bit more watery, which some people like, while tube options are generally a bit thicker.</p><p>Just keep in mind that you won’t want to double dip your fingers into the jar, and sharing with a friend can be kinda weird…tubes are better for that.</p><p><strong>Points of friction:</strong> If you have general chafing in and around your upper thigh and butt area, regular chamois cream is ideal. But if you are a triathlete with chafe spots all over, a stick-based option might be best for you.</p><p><strong>Skin sensitivity</strong>: If you have skin that’s prone to rashes, redness or hives, you will want to skip any chamois creams that promise a tingling sensation. While tea tree oil and menthol can be refreshing and even helpful ingredients for some, for those with sensitive skin, they can be irritants. You may also want to look for unscented options.</p><p><strong>Price</strong>: Even the priciest chamois creams end up being extremely cost-effective on a per-use basis if you use the appropriate amount, so we don’t recommend buying based solely on price. A tube of Chamois Butt’r can easily last for several months if used properly.</p><div id=\"attachment_229141\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-229141\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1619\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large.jpg 1619w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evil-chamois-hagar-grid-3-large-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1619px) 100vw, 1619px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-229141\">Long rides may require chamois cream reapplication.

Evil Bikes)</p></div><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Chamois Cream</h2><p><strong>Do you <em>need</em> chamois cream?</strong><br>Technically, no, but that’s like asking if you <em>need</em> padded bike shorts. Both are pretty darn helpful when you’re doing big hours on the bike, especially if you’re riding long for several days at a time. Chamois cream fights friction between your skin and your shorts/saddle, and can make you more comfortable and less likely to end up with saddle sores or chafing.</p><p>Quick history lesson: Before we invented padding, bike shorts used to have an actual leather chamois in them. It was meant as a sliding layer between our skin and the saddle, the goal to prevent chafing. But, that material (much like a chamois used to dry your car) gets hard and rough when it dries out, so a true chamois cream was used to condition and soften the material and prevent it from chafing your skin.</p><p>Fast forward to today’s high tech, multi-density, foam and gel padding in bike shorts, and we <em>still</em> use chamois creams. Why? Because no matter how good or expensive the material, if you ride long enough, you’ll want something to prevent it from rubbing your skin raw.</p><p><strong>Is there a time I <em>shouldn’t</em> use chamois cream?</strong><br>Generally speaking, if you need to apply chamois cream for even short rides in order to be comfortable, you may need to rethink your shorts, your saddle, or your bike fit. You shouldn’t need chamois cream for rides under 60-90 minutes. So if you’re using it even on your spins around town, it’s time to consider changing something to make your ride more comfortable without lubrication. (Need a new chamois? <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/27/best-womens-bike-shorts/\">We have a list of the best women’s bib shorts right here</a>.)</p><p><strong>How do you use chamois cream?</strong><br>Chamois cream is applied to areas that tend to have friction. Think about where your inner thighs hit the saddle, or where your butt and upper thigh meet. For men, there may be more sensitive chafing spots in and around your groin area.</p><p>To properly apply chamois cream, it’s highly recommended that you use your fingers to apply the cream directly to your skin in the areas that chafe, rather than splashing the cream onto your bib shorts before pulling them on.</p><p>The more targeted approach uses less chamois cream and ensures that it’s in places it should be. Then we just wipe any excess off our hands onto the chamois!</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16140956/chamois-cream-application-guide.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16140956/chamois-cream-application-guide.jpg\" alt=\"how much chamois cream to use\" width=\"1200\" height=\"922\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16140956/chamois-cream-application-guide.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16140956/chamois-cream-application-guide-297x228.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16140956/chamois-cream-application-guide-800x615.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16140956/chamois-cream-application-guide-120x92.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16140956/chamois-cream-application-guide-768x590.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>How much chamois cream should I use?</strong><br>A quarter sized amount is plenty for one application.</p><p><strong>Do I really put it… “there”?</strong><br>Most chamois creams, especially those with essential oils like tea tree or lavender, will advise that you avoid direct contact with “sensitive intimate areas.” That’s another reason you may want to apply chamois cream directly to the skin rather than putting it on your shorts: You can ensure that those sensitive areas don’t end up with a tingle that feels great on skin, but burns on sensitive tissue.</p><p><strong>How often should you reapply chamois cream?</strong><br>It depends on your ride and your skin, and which cream you’re using. Some riders will need to put more on after a couple of hours, especially if it’s rainy out or you’re sweating profusely. Others can last for 10+ hours without needing to reapply.</p><p>But if you’re a regular reapplier, don’t think you can just use a lot at first and it’ll last longer. You still should only use a quarter-sized amount at a time. More is not always better, but maybe a different, thicker cream will work better for you.</p><p><strong>How do you carry chamois cream to reapply?</strong><br>If you’re bikepacking or out all day and know you’ll need to reapply, use a travel-sized spillproof makeup container like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SR4HNGT/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this one</a> to carry a small amount with you so you can reapply as needed.</p><p><strong>Are there any ingredients I should avoid?</strong><br>Avoid petroleum products: These can wreck your chamois by interfering with the antimicrobial properties, and petroleum-based creams on your kit can be difficult to remove. They can also spread and wreck a load of laundry. In fact, some kit manufacturers who typically offer a clothing warranty will void the warranty if you use petroleum-based creams.</p><p>If you have sensitive skin, steer clear of essential oils unless you know that your body tolerates them. Before using a new chamois cream, we recommend doing an allergy test. Use a small amount of the chamois cream on your hand or inner elbow at least 24 hours before using the chamois cream as intended, since some people can react to certain essential oils or other chemicals.</p><p><strong>Does diaper cream work?</strong><br>Think of diaper cream as your post-ride best friend, but generally, not as something that will help you during your ride. It can soothe irritated skin if you do end up with chafing or heat rash, but because it actually contains <em>drying</em> agents—to soothe a wet baby bum—you may find that using it on the bike actually causes more friction after a while, not less.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"965\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1-297x179.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1-800x483.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1-768x463.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12150710/best-cycling-chamois-cream-1-1536x926.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p><strong>What do I do if I have a saddle sore?</strong><br>Saddle sores are an unfortunate side effect of lots of riding. They’re similar to an ingrown hair or a painful pimple, caused by a combination of friction from riding and bacteria growing in that warm, moist environment. If you end up with one, take a day off the bike and let that area breathe! Keep the spot clean and dry, washing gently with a sensitive skin soap, and applying an antibiotic ointment if it opens up. If the saddle sore still hurts, is red, or you develop a fever after a few days, see a doctor: There’s a chance it’s infected.</p><p><strong>How long does chamois cream last?</strong><br>Most chamois creams are pretty good for up to two to three hours, but after that they start to break down. On really sweaty days, sometimes they can simply get washed out from all of the sweat and won’t last as long. The same goes for rainy rides, and that’s where something thicker or more ointment-like is beneficial.</p><p><em>Have more questions?
