The iPhone, iPad and even Watch were all originally conceived under Apple’s co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011.”</p>\n\n<p>I called it a retcon to give Jobs credit for it. Here’s a piece that backs it up, a behind-the-scenes profile by Brad Stone and Adam Satariano for Bloomberg Businessweek back in September 2014, published just after Apple unveiled the Apple Watch at the keynote event for the iPhone 6: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With an Apple Watch wrapped around his hand brass-knuckle style,\nIve reveals that the project was conceived in his lab three years\nago, shortly after Jobs’s death and before “wearables” became a\nbuzzword in Silicon Valley. “It’s probably one of the most\ndifficult projects I have ever worked on,” he says. There are\nnumerous reasons for this — the complexity of the engineering,\nthe need for new physical interactions between the watch and the\nhuman body — but the one most pertinent to Ive is that the Apple\nWatch is the first Apple product that looks more like the past\nthan the future. The company invited a series of watch historians\nto Cupertino to speak, including French author Dominique Fléchon,\nan expert in antique timepieces. Fléchon says only that the\n“discussion included the philosophy of instruments for measuring\ntime” and notes that the Apple Watch may not be as timeless as\nsome classic Swiss watches: “The evolution of the technologies\nwill render very quickly the Apple Watch obsolete,” he says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/27/apple-watch-post-steve-jobs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"01ede3bdfc2429901e8090dc4525cb748e5fa3cc2c5458a9b0ae879e67091e87","category":"Tech"}
