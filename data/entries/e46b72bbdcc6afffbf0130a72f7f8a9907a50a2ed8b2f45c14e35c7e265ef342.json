It’s tempting to rush out and download it. Now that you don’t even need a paid developer account to grab the Developer Beta, there’s nothing but a couple minutes of filling out forms standing between you and an early look at the big iOS update coming this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you may not want to rush out and grab it right away. Running beta operating systems always carries some risk, and early iOS betas especially so. Plus, all the features you may want to try out aren’t in it yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to know to decide whether to try out the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> beta or not, based on the best available current information. We’ll update this article throughout the beta test as the situation changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated August 7: </strong>We’re well into the beta test schedule now, but the iOS 18 beta has been joined by a less-stable <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1 beta</a> for developers.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Current version and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current version of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362001/ios-18-new-features-apple-intelligence-home-screen-control-center-mail-messages.html\">iOS 18</a> beta is: Beta 5, available for developers and public beta testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1 beta</a> available for registered developers who have an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max and meet regional/language requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS 18 beta has a lot of the new features, like the new home screen customization, new Control Center, RCS, Passwords app, new Photos app, and more, but it’s missing some of iOS 18’s most exciting new stuff..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, <em>none</em> of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> features are present, and that includes the new Mail app categorization, Notification summaries, text tools, Image Playground app, and so on. Testing the first round of AI features is what that new iOS 18.1 beta is for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bugs and problems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not uncommon for iOS betas–especially early developer betas–to be full of bugs. That’s the point of beta-testing after all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to some years, these first developer beta releases are actually pretty stable, but that’s not to say they are remotely bug-free. There are occasional crashes when running everyday apps like Apple Music, Control Center’s layout sometimes freaks out, and we’ve seen the typical reports of increased battery drain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest iOS 18 beta is certainly not bug-free, but the general consensus is that most apps work well enough and there aren’t any major showstoppers. Your experience may not be quite as smooth as with a final official release, but beta testers are by-and-large having a relatively smooth experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS 18.1 beta is a little rougher. It’s missing some of the polish of the iOS 18 beta and isn’t always up-to-date with the latest changes. Only a limited set of users can run it anyway (developer accounts with iPhone 15 Pro models) but it’s not recommended for most, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macworld recommends: OK to test iOS 18, WAIT on iOS 18.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We always think it’s a good idea to run any iOS beta release on a secondary device, or at least have a secondary device up-to-date with the latest iOS 17 release and all your apps so you can use it to access anything you may need. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of iOS 18, you don’t really <em>need</em> to run the beta right now unless you’re a developer who really needs to start testing your app or updating it to use new frameworks and APIs. The latest release does offer plenty of new features, but the smarter Siri and new Apple Intelligence stuff is not present at all. If those are the things you are most excited to try, you might as well wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the beta has been smooth sailing with only minor hiccups for most who have tried it, so adventurous users with a fresh backup should feel empowered to jump in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS 18.1 beta is a different story. Available only to those with developer accounts (including free accounts) in supported regions, and limited to U.S. English language and iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max phones, it probably shouldn’t be run by curious enthusiasts just yet. It’s tempting to check out the first Apple Intelligence features, but many of the most exciting ones aren’t there yet, and there are more bugs to contend with.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e46b72bbdcc6afffbf0130a72f7f8a9907a50a2ed8b2f45c14e35c7e265ef342","category":"Apple"}
