This was followed nearly a decade later with SRM’s launch of the first <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meter</a>.</p>\n<p>Power and heart rate are now commonplace among cyclists as a means to use <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a> to monitor intensity and target specific physiological adaptations (you can read our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-vs-heart-rate/\">training with power vs heart rate</a>).</p>\n<p>We’re also seeing more innovative technologies that can measure values such as ventilation rate, muscle oxygen saturation, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/heart-rate-variability/\">heart rate variability</a> during exercise, and apply complex algorithms to determine training intensity zones on the fly.</p>\n<p>However, while these technologies are undoubtedly useful, should we also be taking a more back-to-basics approach to monitoring training intensity?</p>\n<p>More specifically, Rating of Perceived Exertion (or RPE) is an under-rated training metric that should always be considered, irrespective of how many sensors you have monitoring you. What’s more, you don’t need another gadget to measure RPE and use it as a metric to inform your training.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here we’ll take a look at RPE, why it’s important, and how to integrate it into your training.</p>\n<h2>What is RPE?</h2>\n<p>RPE is simply an indication of how hard a session feels subjectively. It’s often quantified numerically (e.g. a 6/10 effort). However, it could also be descriptive (e.g. ‘very easy’, ‘all-out’ etc.).</p>\n<h2>How to measure RPE</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Anouska Koster of The Netherlands and Team Uno-X Pro Cycling Team sprints during the 2nd Tour de France Femmes 2023, Stage 8 a 22.6km individual time trial stage from Pau to Pau\" title=\"Anouska Koster of The Netherlands and Team Uno-X Pro Cycling Team sprints during the 2nd Tour de France Femmes 2023, Stage 8 a 22.6km individual time trial stage from Pau to Pau / #UCIWWT / on July 30, 2023 in Pau, France.

A more practical approach is to grade exercise intensity on a scale of 1-10.</p>\n<p>This is what we’d recommend using, and we’ve included a table below, so you can get a sense of what the different intensities should feel like.</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                    </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n<tr>\n                                                        <th>RPE level</th><th>Brief descriptor</th><th>Detailed description</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td>1</td><td>Almost no exertion</td><td>These levels feel very light.

This nicely illustrates the power of RPE.</p>\n<h3>Using heart rate to capture internal training load</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ineos-Grenadiers rider wearing a Wahoo heart-rate monitor\" title=\"Ineos-Grenadiers rider wearing a Wahoo heart-rate monitor\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While understanding heart rate is undoubtedly useful, RPE can help provide a more holistic view of how hard you’re working.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Internal training load (the stress felt by the body) can also be captured to some extent by measuring heart rate or using the other technologies we mentioned above.</p>\n<p>For example, we often see heart rate drifting upwards towards the end of a long ride, even when power output is kept constant. This tends to reflect the increased internal load arising from muscle fatigue, glycogen depletion, dehydration and increased body temperature.</p>\n<p>In this example, at the start of the ride, you might be able to hold 200 watts at a heart rate of 145bpm, whereas at the end of the ride that same 200 watts requires a heart rate of 155bpm.</p>\n<p>The stress on the body is higher in the latter instance, and you might want to adjust your power targets accordingly when you start to see signs of heart rate drift (this is also known as ‘cardiac drift’).</p>\n<h3>Enter, RPE</h3>\n<p>However, heart rate has some drawbacks. Most notably, it only reflects stressors that have an impact on the cardiovascular system and isn’t so good at capturing other stressors such as neural fatigue and muscular damage, for example.</p>\n<p>The same is true of the other measures mentioned above (e.g. ventilation or muscle oxygen saturation). All methods for objectively measuring internal load so far only give a narrow snapshot of what’s going on in the body.</p>\n<p>RPE, on the other hand, arguably represents a more holistic picture of how hard you’re working. Crucially, for everyday cyclists, it’s also free, easy to use and can help you make better sense of your heart rate and power data and any discrepancies you see between the two.</p>\n<h2>How to use RPE in training</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclist taking a break by the country road to check a mobile phone\" title=\"Cyclist taking a break by the country road to check a mobile phone\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Keep a regular note of RPE to add it to your training and racing armoury.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>There are two key ways that you can use RPE in training: monitoring your ‘form’ and readiness to train; and individualising training intensity targets.</p>\n<h3>Monitoring your ‘form’ and readiness to train</h3>\n<p>Using RPE on a day-by-day basis can help you assess your readiness to train. With this, we’re looking in particular for discrepancies between your RPE and measures of internal/external training load such as power or heart rate.</p>\n<p>For example, if you start a session and notice that your RPE feels high relative to your power output and/or heart rate, then this might be a sign that you’re not sufficiently recovered for a high-intensity session.</p>\n<p>This might mean changing up your plan a bit, perhaps taking a recovery day, doing a low-intensity ride, or postponing any high-intensity training until later in the week.</p>\n<h3>Individualising training intensity targets</h3>\n<p>As we’ve already covered, many riders now train and race using power and/or heart rate zones.</p>\n<p>While these are excellent for giving you a ball-park intensity range to work within, they are rarely perfect, and often need some fine-tuning to suit your own unique physiology.</p>\n<p>Paying attention to RPE can be a smart way to do this – and, in fact, RPE can often be used as the primary intensity metric when pacing high-intensity intervals.</p>\n<p>Some common session types are listed below with their associated RPE level.</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                    </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n<tr>\n                                                        <th>Session</th><th>Usual power &amp;

It doesn’t make sense to persist with a high-intensity training session if you’re simply not fresh enough to perform this session well, for example.</p>\n<h3>4) Hone your RPE skills for use in competition</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Juan Sebastian Molano Benavides of Colombia and UAE Team Emirates crosses the finish line at the Vuelta a Espana\" title=\"78th Tour of Spain 2023 - Stage 4\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Understanding RPE will help you to pace efforts during races and events.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alexander Hassenstein / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Take a mental note of what different effort levels feel like in training and how long you can maintain these efforts. Then keep checking in with yourself during your races or events to make sure you’re keeping the effort to one you know you can maintain.</p>\n<h3>5) Use RPE to help with power control</h3>\n<p>When it comes to RPE, it’s possible to drill down to what each individual pedal stroke feels like, and this can be a great way to help keep your power under control when training.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve done a few pedal strokes at your target wattage, try to remember what this wattage feels like, and aim to emulate that with each subsequent pedal stroke.</p>","author":"Tom Bell","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"294bef51739dd79fb20df1698aad353f6aff08003d475f0b794d2014a3b6018b","category":"Cycling"}
