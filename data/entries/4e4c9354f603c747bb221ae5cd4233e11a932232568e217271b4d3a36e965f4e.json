This time, we look at Chris’ <a href=\"https://www.rodeo-labs.com/shop/framesets/td31/\" target=\"_blank\">Rodeo Labs Trail Donkey</a>, with a pretty wild parts spec. Chris supplied all the build details so let’s check it out below!<span></span></p>\n<p>A friend of mine suggested that I send these photos to you of my new bike build. I just finished this bike the other day. This is a Rodeo Adventure Labs ‘Trail Donkey’ that has been built with my own selection of parts.</p>\n<p>The goal of this build was to build a bikepacking- worthy gravel bike that I could use on long multi-day routes like VTXL and The Colorado Trail. It’s been built for toughness, reliability, and the ability to carry gear over rough terrain!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3602-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\nFrame: Rodeo Adventure Labs ‘Trail Donkey’<br />\nBB: Chris King T47, Matte Mango<br />\nHeadset: Chris King Dropset, Matte Mango</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3594-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Cockpit:</strong><br />\nSeatpost: Cane Creek eeSilk<br />\nSaddle: Brooks England Cambium Carved C17, Chris King Edition<br />\nHandlebars: PNW Coast, 48cm<br />\nStem: Whiskey #7, 60mm<br />\nBar Tape: Silca Nastro Cuscino, Orange<br />\nPedals: Shimano XTR PD-M9100</p>\n<p><strong>Drivetrain:</strong><br />\nFront Derailleur: Ultegra FD-R8000 braze-on<br />\nRear Derailleur: Shimano GRX RD-810<br />\nSTI Levers: Shimano GRX 11spd<br />\nCranks: Cane Creek eeWings Allroad, Rainbow Edition<br />\nChainrings: Absolute Black Gravel 2X 32/48 Oval<br />\nCassette: SRAM 11-36 11spd<br />\nChain: SRAM</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/AE5B707C-8D5D-425C-8FE8-853849BDAB60.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Wheels:</strong><br />\nHubs: DT SWISS 240 EXP, 28h<br />\nRims: Reserve MTN, 28h<br />\nSpokes: DT SWISS COMP<br />\nNipples: Sapir, Orange<br />\nTires: Rene Herse Fleecer Ridge (F), Oracle Ridge (R)<br />\nRotors: Shimano RT-M800 (CL), 160mm</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
