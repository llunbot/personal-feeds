Now, that player has been ordered to pay $500,000 in copyright-based damages and cannot buy, play, or stream Bungie games in the future.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.312044/gov.uscourts.wawd.312044.24.1.pdf\">consent judgment</a> that has apparently been <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.312044/gov.uscourts.wawd.312044.24.0.pdf\">agreed to by both sides of the lawsuit</a> (as <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/bungie-teenage-destiny-2-cheat-settle-differences-with-500k-permaban-230905/\">dug up by TorrentFreak</a>), district court judge Richard Jones agrees with Bungie's claim that defendant Luca Leone's use of cheat software constitutes \"copyright infringement\" of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PuHHmq\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>. Specifically, the cheat software's \"graphical overlay\" and use of \"inject[ed] code\" creates an \"unauthorized derivative work\" that violates federal copyright law. The judgment imposes damages of $150,000 for violations on each of the two infringed works (seemingly encompassing <em>Destiny 2</em> and its expansions)</p>\n<p>Leone also created new accounts to get around multiple ban attempts by Bungie and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/no-minors-cant-just-opt-out-of-destiny-2s-anti-cheating-provisions/\">tried to \"opt out\" of the game's license agreement as a minor</a> in an attempt to do a legal end run around Bungie's multiple account bans. This made each of Leone's subsequent <em>Destiny 2</em> logins unlicensed violation of Bungie's copyright, according to the judge's order, which tacks on $2,000 in damages for each of \"at least 100\" such logins.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966535#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966535&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b099026534584d2506b3016b310be925e6c2d6998e9002f10e998fa67a783be0","category":"Tech"}
