In fact, there is quite a lot of <strong>reluctance and hesitation</strong>, especially from teams that have been burnt by empty promises and poor delivery in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Good UX has a huge impact on business. But often, we need to build up confidence in our upcoming UX projects. For me, an effective way to do that is to <strong>address critical bottlenecks</strong> and <strong>uncover hidden deficiencies</strong> ‚Äî the ones that affect the people I‚Äôll be working with.</p>\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what this can look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is <strong>part of our ongoing series</strong> on <a href=\"/category/ux\">UX</a>. You can find more details on <strong>design patterns and UX strategy</strong> in <a href=\"https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/\">Smart Interface Design Patterns</a>¬†üç£ ‚Äî with live UX training coming up soon. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhZ3el3n-u0\">Free preview</a>.</p>\n\nUX Doesn‚Äôt Disrupt, It Solves Problems\n\n<p><strong>Bottlenecks</strong> are usually the most disruptive part of any company. Almost every team, every unit, and every department has one. It‚Äôs often well-known by employees as they complain about it, but it <strong>rarely finds its way to senior management</strong> as they are detached from daily operations.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/how-to-build-confidence-in-your-ux-work/onion-layers-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>The bottleneck can be the only senior developer on the team, a broken legacy tool, or a confusing flow that throws errors left and right ‚Äî there‚Äôs always a bottleneck, and it‚Äôs usually the reason for <strong>long waiting times</strong>, delayed delivery, and cutting corners in all the wrong places.</p>\n\n<p>We might not be able to fix the bottleneck. But for a smooth flow of work, we need to ensure that non-constraint resources <strong>don‚Äôt produce more</strong> than the constraint can handle. All processes and initiatives must be aligned to support and maximize the efficiency of the constraint.</p>\n\n<p>So before doing any UX work, look out for things that slow down the organization. Show that it‚Äôs not UX work that disrupts work, but it‚Äôs <strong>internal disruptions that UX can help with</strong>. And once you‚Äôve delivered even a tiny bit of value, you might be surprised how quickly people will want to see more of what you have in store for them.</p>\n\nThe Work Is Never Just ‚ÄúThe Work‚Äù\n\n<p>Meetings, reviews, experimentation, pitching, deployment, support, updates, fixes ‚Äî unplanned work blocks other work from being completed. Exposing the <strong>root causes of unplanned work</strong> and finding critical bottlenecks that slow down delivery is not only the first step we need to take when we want to improve existing workflows, but it is also a good starting point for showing the value of UX.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/how-to-build-confidence-in-your-ux-work/work-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>To learn more about the points that create friction in people‚Äôs day-to-day work, <strong>set up 1:1s with the team</strong> and ask them what slows them down. Find a problem that affects everyone. Perhaps too much work in progress results in late delivery and low quality? Or lengthy meetings stealing precious time?</p>\n\n<p>One frequently overlooked detail is that we can‚Äôt manage work that is invisible. That‚Äôs why it is so important that we <strong>visualize the work first</strong>. Once we know the bottleneck, we can <strong>suggest ways to improve it</strong>. It could be to introduce 20% idle times if the workload is too high, for example, or to make meetings slightly shorter to make room for other work.</p>\n\nThe Theory Of Constraints\n\n<p>The idea that the work is never just ‚Äúthe work‚Äù is deeply connected to the Theory of Constraints discovered by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt. It showed that any <strong>improvements made anywhere beside the bottleneck are an illusion</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any improvement after the bottleneck is <strong>useless</strong> because it will always remain starved, waiting for work from the bottleneck. And any improvements made before the bottleneck result in more work <strong>piling up</strong> at the bottleneck.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/how-to-build-confidence-in-your-ux-work/ux-strategy-components-opt.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Wait Time = Busy √∑ Idle</h3>\n\n<p>To improve flow, sometimes we need to freeze the work and bring focus to one single project. Just as important as throttling the <strong>release of work</strong> is managing the <strong>handoffs</strong>. The wait time for a given resource is the percentage of time that the resource is busy divided by the percentage of time it‚Äôs idle. If a resource is 50% utilized, the wait time is 50/50, or 1 unit.</p>\n\n<p>If the resource is 90% utilized, the wait time is 90/10, or 9 times longer. And if it‚Äôs 99% of time utilized, it‚Äôs 99/1, so 99 times longer than if that resource is 50% utilized. The critical part is to <strong>make wait times visible</strong> so you know when your work spends days sitting in someone‚Äôs queue.</p>\n\n<p>The exact times don‚Äôt matter, but if a resource is busy 99% of the time, the wait time will explode.</p>\n\n<h3>Avoid 100% Occupation</h3>\n\n<p>Our goal is to maximize flow: that means exploiting the constraint but <strong>creating idle times for non-constraint</strong> to optimize system performance.</p>\n\n<p>One surprising finding for me was that any attempt to maximize the utilization of all resources ‚Äî <strong>100% occupation</strong> across all departments ‚Äî can actually be <strong>counterproductive</strong>. As Goldratt noted, <em>‚ÄúAn hour lost at a bottleneck is an hour out of the entire system. An hour saved at a non-bottleneck is worthless.‚Äù</em></p>\n\n<h3>Recommended Read: ‚ÄúThe Phoenix Project‚Äù</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/how-to-build-confidence-in-your-ux-work/phoenix-project-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>I can only wholeheartedly recommend <a href=\"https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/\"><em>The Phoenix Project</em></a>, an absolutely incredible book that goes into all the <strong>fine details of the Theory of Constraints</strong> described above.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs not a design book but a great book for designers who want to be more strategic about their work. It‚Äôs a delightful and very real read about the <strong>struggles of shipping</strong> (albeit on a more technical side).</p>\n\nWrapping Up\n\n<p>People don‚Äôt like sudden changes and uncertainty, and UX work often disrupts their usual ways of working. Unsurprisingly, most people tend to block it by default. So before we introduce big changes, we need to get their support for our UX initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>We need to build confidence and <strong>show them the value that UX work can have</strong> ‚Äî for <em>their</em> day-to-day work. To achieve that, we can work together with them. <strong>Listening</strong> to the pain points they encounter in their workflows, to the things that slow them down.</p>\n\n<p>Once we‚Äôve uncovered <strong>internal disruptions</strong>, we can tackle these critical bottlenecks and suggest steps to make existing workflows more efficient. That‚Äôs the foundation to gaining their <strong>trust</strong> and showing them that UX work doesn‚Äôt disrupt but that it‚Äôs here to solve problems.</p>\n\nNew: How To Measure UX And Design Impact\n\n<p>Meet <a href=\"https://measure-ux.com/\">Measure UX &amp; Design Impact</a> (8h), a practical guide for designers and UX leads to measure and show your UX impact on business. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqdSShM8eQ\">Watch the free preview</a> or <a href=\"https://measure-ux.com/\">jump to the details</a>.</p>\n\n\n    <a href=\"https://measure-ux.com/\">\n    <img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/ux-metrics-video-course-release/measure-ux-and-design-impact-course.png\" />\n    </a>\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><a href=\"#\">\nVideo + UX Training</a></li><li><a href=\"#\">Video only</a></li></ul><div><h3>Video + UX Training</h3>$¬†495.00 $¬†799.00\n<a href=\"https://smart-interface-design-patterns.thinkific.com/enroll/3081832?price_id=3951439\">\nGet Video + UX Training<div></div></a><p>25 video lessons (8h) + <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/vitaly-friedman-impact-design/\">Live UX Training</a>.<br />100 days money-back-guarantee.</p></div><div><h3>Video only</h3><div>$¬†250.00$¬†395.00</div>\n<a href=\"https://smart-interface-design-patterns.thinkific.com/enroll/3081832?price_id=3950630\">\nGet the video course<div></div></a><p>25 video lessons (8h).
