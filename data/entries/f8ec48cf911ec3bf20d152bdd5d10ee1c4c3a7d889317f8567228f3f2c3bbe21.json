Similar to the first Prime Day, it will last for two days (October 8-9) and you can find a large selection of deals across Amazon's storefront, covering savings on tech, clothing, video games, groceries, and much, much more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Prime-Big-Deal-Days-Hero-3.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor our coverage, we're focusing entirely on Apple and Apple-related discounts that can be purchased during this 48-hour event on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated throughout the event, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days requires you to have an <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_primelink_nonmember\">Amazon Prime membership</a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime offers a one month free trial, and otherwise costs $14.99 per month or $139.00 per year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPods</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-prime-day.jpeg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStarting with AirPods, you'll find a wide selection of solid deals across the AirPods lineup on Amazon during Prime Day.
