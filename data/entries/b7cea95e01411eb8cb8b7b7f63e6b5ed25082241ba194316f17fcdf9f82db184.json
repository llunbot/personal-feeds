There was no brown in sight (AG2R didn’t exist back then).</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-kit-list\">Tunisia Diaries: What I’m packing to ride 2,311km in 16 days</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-french-alps\">Best places to cycle in the French Alps</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>It was my first introduction to the world of professional cycling, and it all seemed impossibly glamorous – where were the comb-overs and missing teeth that were an integral part of British sport? And look – they’re all speaking French!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was hooked, but it seems the rest of country was less bothered. For the next couple of decades TV coverage of cycling remained patchy at best, and the number of Brits competing in the top flight could be counted on one hand (Millar, Boardman, the other Millar, Yates and, er…).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why it was so exciting when all the Lottery loot unleashed a wave of Olympic track cycling medals, which begat Team Sky, which led to Britain’s first Tour de France victory in 2012. All of a sudden everyone loved cycling. You couldn’t move for Brits in the pro peloton; races were covered on the morning sports reports; fans flocked to domestic events; British teams flourished. Cycling was finally big in Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happened? Only a few years later, major British races are being cancelled and teams are disbanding. Have we as a nation fallen out of love with cycling so quickly? And what’s to be done to revive the sport’s fortunes in this country?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a topic we explore this issue when we meet the people trying to keep domestic racing alive and protect the legacy of its great British pioneers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder whatever happened to Robert Millar…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Chris Storrar</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 141?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Circle of Death:</strong> In homage to one of the most famous stages of the Tour de France, <em>Cyclist</em> takes on five legendary passes for one mammoth day in the Pyrenees</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Being Pippa:</strong> The first Brit to win a classification at the Tour de France, Pippa York talks racing, transitioning and the current pro cycling scene</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>State of the nation:</strong> With the number of British-registered teams in decline, marquee races cancelled and cross-curricular funding at historic lows, what hope is there for the UK race scene? <em>Cyclist</em> joins domestic squad Saint Piran at the Rutland- Melton International CiCLE Classic to find out</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Game plan for the Étape: </strong>L’Étape du Tour is one of the most popular – and toughest – events on the amateur calendar.
