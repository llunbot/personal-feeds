Delivering exceptional comfort, they led us to ask whether they are the perfect set of cycling shorts.</p>\n<p>7Mesh has made these shorts from Miti Gravity Interpower, which is 38 per cent elastane and 62 per cent warp knit nylon. The result is a fabric that is super-soft against the skin and is slightly compressive, aiding blood flow and reducing fatigue in the legs as a result.</p>\n<p>The seat pad uses a high-density foam that has been designed to reduce numbness in the perineum area, and almost completely eliminates any unwanted pressure.</p>\n<p>Up top, the shoulder straps aren’t excessively tight, giving you room to move, but they still hold the shorts perfectly in place. They are also thin enough to let any heat dissipate.</p>\n<p>Overall, if you’re looking for a sleek set of shorts with superb comfort and excellent quality, you can’t go wrong with these bibs.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/road-cycling-shorts/7mesh-mk3-bib-shorts-review/\">Read our full 7Mesh MK3 Bib Shorts review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Assos Equipe RS Bib Shorts S9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Assos Equipe RS Bib Shorts S9 for road cycling\" title=\"Summer outfits shorts Assoss 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Equipe RS is one of the best fitting shorts and worth the outlay.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S–XXXL</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Black, black/white, black/red, black/green</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £175/$260/€200/AU$370 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Assos combines a minimalist approach with technology in these lightweight Equipe RS bib shorts.

Extra material up front provides added comfort.</p>\n<p>The bib system sees the rear straps attach lower down the back to hold the seat pad in position. This works well at stabilising, even when getting out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>The three-layer perforated waffle foam S9 pad has a micro-shock core and soaks up vibrations admirably.

Your shorts should feel skin-tight and supportive, without causing any discomfort.</p>\n<h3>Chamois pad</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Chamois pad on road cycling bib shorts\" title=\"Bib Shorts Best of 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some brands use gel inserts at the contact points to provide relief.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Padded cycling shorts will feature a chamois stitched inside the shorts to provide relief and comfort around the sit bones.</p>\n<p>Not all pads are created equal and finding a design that works for you is crucial to long-term comfort.</p>\n<p>Once again, the fit should be snug to avoid chafing, while a breathable pad will help keep things good downstairs.</p>\n<p>Most pads vary the density and thickness of padding through the chamois to provide support where it’s needed most, while some use gel inserts in a bid to improve comfort.</p>\n<h3>Comfortable bib straps</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bib straps of Castelli Free Aero RC shorts\" title=\"13-19-45_SNY0386\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bib straps hold the shorts up and shouldn’t dig into your stomach or shoulders.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bib straps are designed to help keep your bib shorts in place, without the need for an uncomfortably tight waistband.</p>\n<p>The stretchy straps need to be tight enough to hold your shorts in place securely, but not so tight that they make putting the shorts on difficult or uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>If possible, we’d recommend trying shorts on for size before you make a purchase.</p>\n<h3>Leg grippers</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Castelli Competizione bib shorts for male cyclists\" title=\"Castelli Competizione bib shorts - 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You don’t want the ends of the shorts flapping in the wind.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Leg grippers help keep the ends of the shorts in place while pedalling, ideally providing a secure fit without causing discomfort.</p>\n<p>There are a number of ways to achieve this, from a simple silicone strip or elasticated band on more affordable shorts to a laser-cut hem backed with a sticky fabric on high-end shorts.</p>\n<h3>Should you wear underwear under your cycling shorts?</h3>\n<p><span>In short, no. This is because the pads in padded cycling shorts are designed to sit directly next to your skin.</span></p>\n<p><span>For a detailed explanation on this subject, see our article on </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/should-i-wear-underwear-under-padded-cycling-shorts/\"><span>should I wear underwear under padded cycling shorts?</span></a></p>\n<h3>Bib shorts versus waist shorts</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Castelli Competizione bib shorts for male cyclists\" title=\"Castelli Competizione bib shorts - 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most cyclists prefer bib shorts, which use straps to provide a secure, comfortable fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The general consensus among dedicated cyclists is clear: bib shorts are better than waist shorts.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shorts-are-superior-to-bib-shorts/\"><span>Not everyone agrees</span></a><span>, but most find that shorts with bib straps tend to stay in place better than shorts without.</span></p>\n<p><span>The added tightness in the vertical plane helps pull the chamois up into your body, preventing it sagging away from you when you stand up on the pedals. This means less shifting around and more consistent pad placement, and ultimately comfort. </span></p>\n<p><span>It also does away with the need for a tight, high waistband, instead putting the emphasis on the elasticated shoulder straps to keep everything in place. This can enable the use of a slightly lower front panel as well, for increased ventilation.</span></p>\n<h3>What is a chamois pad?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Endura Pro SL Bibshort\" title=\"20200316_SB_5DSR_MG_1173\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A chamois pad is sewn onto the inside of cycling bib shorts to increase comfort and help wick sweat away from your body.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>A chamois pad, or seat pad, is the saddle-shaped padding usually found in cycling bib shorts. They are called a “chamois” because, back in the olden days, they used to be made from chamois leather, which is named after the European mountain goat it’s derived from.</span></p>\n<p><span>Today, they’re usually made from a combination of synthetic, multi-density foams and fabrics. These are designed not only to provide some cushioning for your derrière, but also to wick sweat away to help keep your crotch area dry and healthy.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bend-in-the-road-proper-chamois-placement-is-key/\"><span>Proper placement of the pad is key</span></a><span>, so it’s worth taking into consideration the type of riding you’ll be doing. Cyclists taking part in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trials</a> or triathlons, with aggressive, forward positions, need much more padding around the front than mountain bikers, who are likely to be sat more upright.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, you also need a good saddle, and performance-oriented saddles tend to be firmer than you might expect because they’re designed with cyclists wearing padded shorts in mind. </span></p>\n<h3>Do you need to use chamois cream?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Chamois cream collage\" title=\"Chamois cream collage\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some riders swear by chamois cream, so try it for yourself.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Potentially.
