Apple should also be winding down work on iOS 17 ahead of a release next month, though the company is continuing to fix bugs and make tweaks, so be sure to read on below for all the details on this week's top stories!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple's iPhone 15 Event Likely to Be Held on September 12</h2>\r<br />\nApple's annual iPhone event is pretty much always held in the first two weeks of September, but with just about a month to go it appears the exact date for 2023 is getting pinned down.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Blue-Front-Perspective-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nInitial reports indicated the event was likely to take place on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/06/iphone-15-event-september-12-or-13/\">either Tuesday, September 12, or Wednesday, September 13,</a> but it looks like things are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/iphone-15-september-12-event/\">firming up for the September 12 date</a> and we're once again <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/iphone-15-event-pre-recorded-format/\">expecting it to be a pre-recorded video</a> even for in-person attendees.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the usual pattern, pre-orders for the new iPhones should begin a few days later on Friday, September 15, with a launch following a week later on September 22. It is possible, however, that some models may see tight initial supplies or slightly delayed launch dates depending on how early production is going.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Images of Alleged iPhone 15 USB-C Connector Parts Leak Online</h2>\r<br />\nThe iPhone 15 lineup is all but confirmed to be switching from Lightning to USB-C, but this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/iphone-15-usb-c-parts-leak/\">saw some photographic evidence</a> in the form of alleged USB-C ports from the various models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Blue-USB-C-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThis week also saw a claim that the Pro models will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/iphone-15-pro-2tb-storage-option/\">storage options up to 2TB</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/tvos-code-a17-chip-iphone-15/\">code included in tvOS 17 betas</a> suggests Apple will continue this year's pattern of using a new A17 chip for the iPhone 15 Pro models while the regular iPhone 15 models use an A16 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnd finally, another rumor claims that A17 chip in the Pro models will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/apple-a17-chip-6-core-gpu/\">paired with 6GB of RAM</a> as on iPhone 14 Pro models, despite other reports saying RAM will be bumped to 8GB this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Watch Series 9 'Basically Unchanged' Other Than Performance Boost From S9 Chip</h2>\r<br />\nAlongside the iPhone 15 lineup, we're also expecting to see new Apple Watch models at the September event. Rumors suggest we'll be seeing a nice performance boost with a new S9 chip, but otherwise the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/\">said to be \"basically unchanged.\"</a>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Woven-Magnet-Strap-Mock-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" />\r<br />\nOne rumor suggests <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/\">we may see a new band option</a> alongside the Series 9, a woven fabric one with a magnetic buckle priced at $99 when purchased on its own.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Everything New in iOS 17 Beta 5</h2>\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/apple-seeds-ios-17-beta-5-to-developers/\">seeded a fifth developer beta</a> and third public beta of iOS 17 this week, alongside related beta updates such as macOS Sonoma and watchOS 10.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThere were a number of tweaks in the latest iOS 17 beta, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/ios-17-beta-5-features/\">which we've rounded up in an article</a>. We're also continuing our deeper dives into iOS 17 changes for various features, with our latest guides covering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airdrop/\">AirDrop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airplay/\">AirPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/\">AirPods</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-siri-spotlight/\">Siri and Spotlight</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Testing M3 Max Chip With 16-Core CPU and 40-Core GPU</h2>\r<br />\nWe're continuing to learn more about the upcoming M3 family of chips for the Mac, thanks to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman digging into third-party app developer logs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg\" alt width=\"1810\" height=\"1018\" />\r<br />\nThose logs indicate that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-m3-max-chip/\">next-generation M3 Max chip</a> for higher end machines like the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro will include up to 16 CPU cores and 40 GPU cores. Built using a new 3nm process, the chip should include significant speed and efficiency improvements even beyond the increased core counts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also a new Mac model with the base M3 chip that recently showed up in logs, and it's presumably an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-testing-mac-mini-m3/\">updated version of the Mac mini</a>. That chip is also expected to appear in updated iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>10 Hidden Easter Eggs in macOS</h2>\r<br />\nThis week, we took a fun look at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/10-hidden-easter-eggs-in-macos/\">a number of Easter eggs hidden in macOS</a>, ranging from the infamous \"Blue Screen of Death\" on Windows and Clarus the dogcow to Steve Jobs' eyeglasses and the iconic \"Here's to the crazy ones\" poem from Apple's \"Think Different\" marketing campaign.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/10-Hidden-Easter-Eggs-in-macOS-3.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/10-hidden-easter-eggs-in-macos/\">Check out our full list</a> and let us know what other Easter eggs you're aware of in Apple's operating systems\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/aug-10-2023\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/12/top-stories-iphone-15-event-date-rumor/\">Top Stories: iPhone 15 Event Date, Apple Watch and Mac Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-15-event-date-apple-watch-and-mac-rumors-and-more.2398455/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"78e9d85d6e53975c3167290e31a27d6bf4e078c0364e6e2339018a3834d741e9","category":"Apple"}
