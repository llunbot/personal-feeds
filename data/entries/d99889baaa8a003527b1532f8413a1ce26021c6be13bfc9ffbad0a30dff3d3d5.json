If you're one of them and you don't fancy putting up with the random brightness changes, Signify suggests that you temporarily disconnect your Hue Bridge from your Matter smart home system until the fix arrives. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/\">Philips Hue</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/philips-hue-bulbs-max-brightness-bug/\">Philips Hue Bulbs Randomly Turning Up to Max Brightness, But a Fix Is Coming</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-bulbs-randomly-turning-up-to-max-brightness-but-a-fix-is-coming.2430966/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d99889baaa8a003527b1532f8413a1ce26021c6be13bfc9ffbad0a30dff3d3d5","category":"Apple"}
