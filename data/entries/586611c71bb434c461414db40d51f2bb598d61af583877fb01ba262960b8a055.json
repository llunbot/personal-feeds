Instead of the iconic Champs-Élysées, the <em>Grande Boucle</em> will reach its climax on Nice’s Promenade des Anglais, and not with the traditional processional sprint stage but instead a 35.2km time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all change for the world’s greatest bike race, but here at <em>Cyclist</em> there’s no change to our Big Ride each issue taking you to the world’s best places to ride a bike, and this month we’re honouring the Tour’s historic move by heading to the south of France for a ride starting and ending in Nice and taking in some of the glorious riding to be had once you head inland.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classics-breakout-2024\">The breakout stars of the Spring Classics 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-monument-ranking\">Every Tadej Pogačar Monument performance ranked</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2024: Stage-by-stage preview and how to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>One race that has never finished (or started, for that matter) anywhere but Paris is the historic – and frankly bonkers – Paris-Brest-Paris, a 1,200km sufferfest that takes place every four years and gathers thousands of riders to test themselves against possibly the hardest race on two wheels anywhere on the planet. This issue we tell the story of the race from the inside by taking on this epic challenge the way it was done all the way back in 1891. What could go wrong?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a much shorter challenge, why not head to the Italian Dolomites and take on the breathtaking Passo Gardena? This issue we do just that in the latest of our Classic Climbs series, following in the wheeltracks of Coppi, Bartali and many others up this deceptively tough yet deeply enchanting climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to bikes, we’ve got the lowdown on the latest Giant TCR, along with reviews of the Enve Mog gravel bike and the titanium Seven Axiom XX, plus we lift the curtain on some of our own bikes in the latest instalment of our What We Ride series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the June 2024 issue, we talk to Bora-Hansgrohe boss Ralph Denk about what the future holds now that Red Bull is involved with the team, take a closer look at what goes into targeting a world record, recount the extraordinary Alfonsina Strada making history at the Giro in 1924 by becoming the first and only woman to compete in a men’s Grand Tour, and speak to Maurice Burton about some of the memories that inspired his insightful memoir <em>The Maurice Burton Way</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a
