It is hidden away on the Applecross Peninsula, which lies on the northwest coast of Scotland at approximately the same latitude as Inverness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nearest village is Lochcarron – a single street of houses with a couple of hotels, a pub and a Spar – which is a good four and a half hours’ drive from Glasgow and the best place to establish base camp for an assault on the climb.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Bealach na Ba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Crossing the bridge over the River Kishorn at the start of the climb</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most remote places on the British mainland. Admittedly, that doesn’t mean much these days. There’s nowhere in this country that is more than six miles from a tarmacked road, but <i>the</i> most remote place is a desolate spot on the next peninsula over from Applecross, so this is about as wild as you’re going to get in Great Britain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately the locals are well used to the sight of Lycra-clad strangers who set off from the village full of laughter and <i>joie de vivre</i>, only to return some hours later with the hollow-eyed look of war veterans.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-03-780x970.jpg\" alt=\"Bealach na Ba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-03-780x970.jpg 780w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-03-241x300.jpg 241w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-03-768x955.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-03-750x933.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-03-1140x1417.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The sign at the beginning spells out what is to come – it might as well say, ‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here…’</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>From Lochcarron it’s a relatively gentle 10km ride to the turning off the A896, next to the Bealach Cafe, that marks the start of the climb. At first glance, the road ahead looks mostly flat and unintimidating, but the sign at the roadside leaves you in no doubt about what’s to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there are no fewer than four signs, just in case you didn’t get the message the first time. The first reads, ‘This road rises to a height of 2,053ft with gradients of 1 in 5 and hairpin bends. NOT ADVISED FOR DRIVERS OF VERY LARGE VEHICLES OR CARAVANS AND MOTORHOMES AFTER FIRST MILE.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below that, the second sign advises an alternative route. Sign three declares, ‘ROAD NORMALLY IMPASSABLE IN WINTRY CONDITIONS’. Then underneath, for good measure, is the fourth sign: ‘HIGH SNOW RISK’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Bealach na Ba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Looking out over Loch Kishorn towards the Isle of Skye</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Of course, most of the messages have been obscured by stickers from cycling and motorcycle clubs, so it’s easy to scoff and ignore the warnings as you slip serenely past, still convinced that no British climb can really be that hard. Can it?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Into the valley</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The average gradient of the whole climb is 6.4% – not the most frightening of stats – but the first couple of kilometres seem to barely rise at all, meaning that the remainder of the 9.7km will average something far more concerning. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"771\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-05-771x970.jpg\" alt=\"Bealach na Ba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-05-771x970.jpg 771w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-05-239x300.jpg 239w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-05-768x966.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-05-750x943.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-05-1140x1434.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Towering rock fortresses guard the entrance to the valley and mark the point where the gradients ramp up ferociously</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Anyone who has sneaked a look at the profile chart will know the benign green section at the start is followed by a stretch of yellow that turns into orange by kilometre five, before morphing into ever-darker shades of red. This is not a climb on which to burn too many matches early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the turn off the main road, a stone bridge takes you over the River Kishorn and the road swings southwest to trace the course of the river. The going is close to flat, and it’s easy to skip along the thin strip of tarmac as it skirts around the ominous mass of mountains.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Bealach na Ba\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classic-climb-bealach-na-ba-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Having skirted southwest around the hillside, the road swings northwest at the 4.7km mark to face the climb head on</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bealach na Bà translates as ‘pass of the cattle’, but the road is so narrow it’s hard to see how two cows could pass each other, let alone cars. Even cyclists have to pause in the passing places to allow vehicles past, which can be an impediment to establishing a steady rhythm or a blessed moment of relief, depending on your point of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the river drops down to empty into Loch Kishorn, so the road swings up towards the mountains, the gradient creeping up to 6%.
