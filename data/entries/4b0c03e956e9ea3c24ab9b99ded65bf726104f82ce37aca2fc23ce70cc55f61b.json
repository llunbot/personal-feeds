Apple says that in-app events can encourage people to try out apps, provide existing users with new ways to enjoy an app, and give former users a reason to return.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEvents will start appearing in the ‌App Store‌ on devices running ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ on Wednesday, October 27.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe update could be timed to the iOS and iPadOS 15.1 release, which is coming next week. Apple has confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> is coming on Monday, October 25, but it is not yet clear if the iOS and iPadOS 15.1 updates will come on the same day or later in the week, such as on the 27th.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/app-store-events-feature/\">Apple Calls on Developers to Take Advantage of New In-App Events App Store Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-calls-on-developers-to-take-advantage-of-new-in-app-events-app-store-feature.2318494/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=D5QLqu76Hpc:Y7samUB65iU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=D5QLqu76Hpc:Y7samUB65iU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/D5QLqu76Hpc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4b0c03e956e9ea3c24ab9b99ded65bf726104f82ce37aca2fc23ce70cc55f61b","category":"Apple"}
