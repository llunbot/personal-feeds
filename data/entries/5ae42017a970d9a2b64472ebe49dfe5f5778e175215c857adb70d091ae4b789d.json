The latest turns them into a bonafide hearing aid with iOS 18.1, but what’s even better, however, is the fact that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\">you can get these $249 earbuds for just $179 right now</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2-review-2.html\">we reviewed the AirPods Pro 2</a>, we gave these earbuds a near-perfect 4.5-star rating, appreciating the audio quality, the excellent noise canceling, and the superb transparency mode. “On the outside, not much has changed with these second-generation AirPods Pro. But the sound quality has improved a lot, noise canceling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par. There’s not a lot here you can’t find on other models, but Apple makes it easy and has caught up to its fierce competition,” our review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring the H2 chip, these earbuds promise a deep and immersive sound with crisp, high notes and a rich bass. They come with four pairs of silicone tips in multiple sizes so you can obtain that perfect noise cancellation level. Since our review, the AirPods Pro 2 has gained a USB-C case, Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume, and can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2498966/your-airpods-pro-2-can-now-work-as-a-hearing-aid-heres-how.html\">even act as a hearing aid</a> with a built-in clinical-grade test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since they’re available for nearly 30 percent off their regular price, it would be a shame not to take advantage of this Amazon deal. So go <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\">grab the AirPods Pro 2 for $179</a> and treat your ears to great sound and good health.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the best earbuds for $70 off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5ae42017a970d9a2b64472ebe49dfe5f5778e175215c857adb70d091ae4b789d","category":"Apple"}
