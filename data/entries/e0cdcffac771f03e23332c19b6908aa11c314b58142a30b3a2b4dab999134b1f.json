As a result, Apple is able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps, but it must allow developers to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/\">made changes to its U.S. App Store policies</a>, and now allows apps to feature a single link to a developer website that leads to an in-app purchase alternative. However, Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought this way. The commission applies to transactions for digital goods and services that take place on a developers website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link to an external website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic likely wishes to contest this aspect of the change in particular, as well as Apple's implementation of them. ‌Epic Games‌‌ CEO Tim Sweeney on January 16 took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize the‌ changes as soon as they were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/\">announced</a>, and said that it would dispute Apple's \"bad-faith compliance plan\" in District Court. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>A quick summary of glaring problems we've found so far:<br /><br />1) Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web purchases.

Apple bases the claim on Epic's original violation of its developer agreement, when its <em>Fortnite</em> game offered an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/fornite-adds-direct-payment-option-on-ios/\">in-app payment alternative</a> on the ‌‌App Store‌‌.
