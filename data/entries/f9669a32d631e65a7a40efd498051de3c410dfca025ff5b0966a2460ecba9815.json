{"title":"Josh Marshall: ‘The Deep Archeology of Fox News’","link":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-deep-archeology-of-fox-news/sharetoken/yA5t0jXPM5sN","date":1678039015000,"content":"\n<p>Josh Marshall, writing at TPM:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The evidence emerging from the Dominion lawsuit against Fox News\nhas the quality of liberal fever dreams. What’s the worst you can\npossibly imagine about Fox? What’s the most cartoonish caricature,\nthe worst it could possibly be? Well, in these emails and texts\nyou basically have that. Only it’s real. It’s not anyone believing\nthe worst and giving no benefit of the doubt. This is what Fox is.</p>\n\n<p>In a moment like this it’s worth stepping way, way back, not just\nto the beginning of Fox News in 1996 but to the beginning of the\nbroader countermovement it was a part of and even a relatively\nlate entry to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the things that is clear from the very start of the\nconservative movement was a basic failure to quite understand the\nthing they rallied themselves against, the history that in Bill\nBuckley’s famous phrase he was standing athwart and yelling\n“Stop!” None of the organizations that the right took issue with — the think tanks, the news publications, the movie studios, the\nnonprofits, the book publishers — were ideological, let alone\npartisan, organizations. When the founders of modern conservatism\nlooked at CBS News they saw the shock troops of liberalism and\nthe Democratic Party. Same with Brookings and the Washington Post\nand all the rest. And when they went to build their own versions\nof these institutions they patterned them off their own\ncartoonish understandings of how these operations functioned. The\nidea that institutions like CBS News or The New York Times were,\nwhatever their faults and unexamined biases, fundamentally rooted\nin an ethic of news gathering and reporting was really totally\nlost on them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a broad sense it all comes back to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6ZnuYKKtpxg\">Stephen Colbert’s iconic line from his <em>Colbert Report</em> alter ego</a>: “It is a well known fact that reality has a liberal bias.” U.S. conservatives couldn’t/can’t see that, or refuse to see it, and instead operate on the assumption that all journalism — and science — that points toward liberal conclusions is ideological. Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously quipped, “You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” The foundational element of the modern U.S. conservative movement is that facts and opinions are interchangeable, that their opinions not only <em>can</em> trump our facts, they <em>do</em>, purely by the force of their convictions. Whoever shouts loudest wins, not whoever presents the best evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the other defining difference between Fox News and all non-rightwing TV news organizations: anger. Put partisanship and ideology aside. The anchors at  other news channels are dispassionate; the anchors on Fox are <em>angry</em>, and they drum up anger amongst their viewers. You could see this difference best if you didn’t understand English. The anger is palpable and it never ends. Their product is outrage, not edification. They were angry under Clinton, Obama, and now Biden, yes. But they were just as angry under George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The <em>feelings over facts</em> worldview demands it, but it is to the detriment of us all.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to watch the video clip Marshall includes in his column, of Tucker Carlson speaking at the CPAC conference in 2009. It’s an utterly different Carlson than the one who today leads Fox News. He argued then, correctly, that conservatism needs fact-first news organizations. He almost got booed off the stage. The rest is history.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/05/marshall-fox-new-archeology\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f9669a32d631e65a7a40efd498051de3c410dfca025ff5b0966a2460ecba9815","category":"Tech"}
