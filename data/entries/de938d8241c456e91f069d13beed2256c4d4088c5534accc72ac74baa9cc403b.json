These tweaks continue a trend that has intensified over Windows 10's lifecycle—you <em>can </em>use any browser you want on Windows! But are you sure you wouldn't like to try Microsoft Edge instead? Are you <em>sure</em>? Are you <em>really, really sure</em>?</p>\n<p>There are two functional changes in the current beta of Windows 11 that make switching browsers more annoying. The first is that the OS no longer pops up a window asking you if you'd like to switch browsers the first time you click a link after installing a new browser. The second is that the \"default apps\" screen has removed the broad app categories currently available in Windows 10. Windows 10 allows you to set the default email app, map app, music player, photo viewer, video player, and web browser from the default apps screen, while Windows 11 makes you choose an app first and assign defaults one file extension at a time.</p>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/win10-default-2-980x613.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Windows 10's Default Apps settings screen lets you change the default apps for a handful of common tasks, like browsing, checking email, or playing video.
