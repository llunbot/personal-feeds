The eight-episode standalone series is set in the same time frame as <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>Ahsoka</em>.</p>\n<p>Executive producer Kathleen Kennedy was intrigued when series co-creator Jon Watts pitched a Star Wars series inspired by the 1985 film <em>The Goonies</em>. (Kennedy had co-produced that film and co-founded Amblin Entertainment.) She told co-creator Christopher Ford that <em>The Goonies</em> hadn't been created specifically for kids, instead telling a story that just happened to be about kids going on an adventure. So Ford and Watts wrote <em>Skeleton Crew</em> with the same mindset: a show for everyone that just happened to feature kids as the central characters. Per the official premise:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Skeleton Crew</em> follows the journey of four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet, then get lost in a strange and dangerous galaxy, crossing paths with the likes of Jod Na Nawood, the mysterious character played by [Jude] Law. Finding their way home—and meeting unlikely allies and enemies—will be a greater adventure than they ever imagined.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jude Law leads the cast as the quick-witted and charming (per Law) \"Force-user\" Jod Na Nawood. Ravi Cabot-Conyers plays Wim, Ryan Kiera Armstrong plays Fern, Kyriana Kratter plays KB, and Robert Timothy Smith plays Neil. Nick Frost will voice a droid named SM 33. The cast also includes Tunde Adebimpe, Kerry Condon, and Jaleel White in as yet undisclosed roles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042397#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042397&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"95632af3b6a599e9727e3abc8e3f9d0c9f3a2890074706fee39f07ee2999dd1e","category":"Tech"}
