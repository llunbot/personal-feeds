They add to that platform with an all-new carbon layup, reduced spoke count to 16 spokes front and rear, XD-15 ceramic bearings, and stealth cerakoted hub shells for increased longevity and striking aesthetics. The full wheelset weighs only 1385 grams.</p>\n<p><img width=\"6918\" height=\"4611\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/EOS-AR-RR-Straight.jpg?fit=1200,4611&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/EOS-AR-RR-Straight.jpg?w=6918&amp;quality=75 6918w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/EOS-AR-RR-Straight.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/EOS-AR-RR-Straight.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/EOS-AR-RR-Straight.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/EOS-AR-RR-Straight.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/EOS-AR-RR-Straight.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Despite the low spoke count, the EOS AR has no rider weight limit, speaking confidently about the strength and durability of the wheelset. Rolf Prima says that placing the spokes together makes an inherently more aerodynamic wheel and equalized spoke-pull creates snappy acceleration and allows the use of fewer spokes – as evident across their line.</p>\n<p>With the EOS AR’s unique shape and rim properties, they were able to reduce the spoke count further, offering a 16/16 disc brake wheel for the first time in the company’s 25 year history.</p>\n<p>The new EOS AR is available now and retails for $2999.00.
