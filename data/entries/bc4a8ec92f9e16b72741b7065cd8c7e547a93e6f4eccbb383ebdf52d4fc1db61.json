There was an issue with the Neural Engine that could allow an application to execute arbitrary code with system privileges on devices with a Neural Engine, and a CoreML bug could let attackers cause unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also addressed issues with FontParser, Preferences, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, WebKit, and WiFi, all of which are outlined in Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212814\">full security document</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor those not particularly interested in the feature set that ‌iOS 15‌ offers, it may still be a good idea to upgrade just to get the full suite of security fixes that Apple has deployed.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-improved-face-id-anti-spoofing/\">iOS 15 Includes Improved Face ID Anti-Spoofing Models and Other Vulnerability Fixes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-includes-improved-face-id-anti-spoofing-models-and-other-vulnerability-fixes.2312091/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lqJTFUfPLmo:eHDYwWNe4yA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lqJTFUfPLmo:eHDYwWNe4yA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lqJTFUfPLmo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc4a8ec92f9e16b72741b7065cd8c7e547a93e6f4eccbb383ebdf52d4fc1db61","category":"Apple"}
