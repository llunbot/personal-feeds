Dithering as a standalone subscription costs just $7/month or $70/year. People who try Dithering seem to love it, too — we have remarkably little churn.</p>\n\n<p>Recording the show often helps me coagulate loose ideas into fully-formed thoughts. Both my <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/andy_grove_was_right\">Tuesday column on Intel’s decline</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/dont_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_generative_ai_bullshit_bathwater\">today’s on using generative AI for research</a> were inspired by our discussion on the show the night before. I toss a lot of takes out on Dithering that never make it here, though. If you’re on the fence, subscribe for a month and you’re only out $7 — but I bet you’ll stick around. Trust me. And thanks to everyone who’s already subscribed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/06/dithering\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"de1f163c84a813878478c176da7493d3802cc0e8b7ec6db19b6ee08350b10f2e","category":"Tech"}
