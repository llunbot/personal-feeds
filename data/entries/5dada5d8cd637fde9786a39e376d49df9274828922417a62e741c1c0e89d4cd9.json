Starting this Wednesday, customers who recycle electronics that are not eligible for trade-in credit at an Apple Store will temporarily qualify for up to $20 off select Apple accessories, including the AirTag, AirPods, Apple Pencil, Apple Watch bands, iPhone cases, and the Magic Mouse/Trackpad/Keyboard trio for Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple even accepts certain electronics from other brands for free recycling, so it will be interesting to see what qualifies for this promotion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe promotion will run for one month, according to Gurman. It is unclear if the offer will be available in the U.S. only, or in multiple countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile a 10% discount is not significant, Apple rarely offers direct savings on its products beyond its annual Back to School and Black Friday events.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earth-day/\">Earth Day</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/apple-to-launch-recycling-promotion/\">Apple Stores to Offer 10% Off Accessories When You Recycle Electronics</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stores-to-offer-10-off-accessories-when-you-recycle-electronics.2455365/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5dada5d8cd637fde9786a39e376d49df9274828922417a62e741c1c0e89d4cd9","category":"Apple"}
