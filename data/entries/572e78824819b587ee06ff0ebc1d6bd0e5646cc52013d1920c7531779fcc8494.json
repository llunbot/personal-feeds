Some of it can be interesting, but let us be honest, most of it is not so, and in many cases, the claims can be wild!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two days spent traipsing around <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/2021-eurobike\" target=\"_blank\">Eurobike</a>, Europe’s biggest bike show, can result in endless sales people, designers, and engineers talking your ear off about their latest goodies. Learning the polite way to duck out of an intense and passionate pitch is a life skill any cycling journalist needs to acquire quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we thought we’d extend that skill a bit further. We had to because, unlike in previous years, the show only lasted two days rather than three, so time was tight. So to get through the barrage of info and get to the juice quotes that we needed to hear, we gave each brand (or at least those that were up for a laugh) 60 seconds to try and sell us their latest and greatest item on show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me present to you the good folks from DMT, Wilier, Gravaa, Unior, Cipollini, and Hunt who took on our challenge and, for the most part, succeeded. They hope.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/eurobike-2021-we-asked-brands-for-60-second-sales-pitches/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"572e78824819b587ee06ff0ebc1d6bd0e5646cc52013d1920c7531779fcc8494","category":"Cycling"}
