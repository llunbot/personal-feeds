It was an invite to a private Twitch stream, access to his running online diary, and an upload of his 180-page manifesto.</p>\n<p>Those who clicked the link saw Gendron sitting in his car, in the parking lot of the Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York. They watched as he lifted his AR-15-style rifle, equipped with a high-capacity magazine, and opened fire. He killed 10 people in just six minutes.</p>\n<p>Even before police stopped the massacre and arrested Gendron, the link was being posted to the anonymous imageboard 4chan. On /pol/, the site’s “politically incorrect” board, people commented in real time on the mass shooting. “Why not shoot up the abortion rallys? What a faggot,” one user wrote. Another chimed in: “The kids manifesto is actually pretty good.” Dozens of people who missed the livestream demanded a recording. Others declared it a deep-state false flag operation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945646#p3\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945646&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9ca5b2d640c779f6c13b08d219c83ea2111d95988107bd17fbb58fc3fe48f658","category":"Tech"}
