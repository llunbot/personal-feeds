Orders are live in the U.S. online store ahead of the February 2 launch date with the Vision Pro limited to the United States for the time being, although shipping estimates for new orders <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-delivery-dates-slip/\">quickly began slipping into March</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Vision-Pro-Pre-Orders-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAlongside the start of pre-orders, Apple shared some additional details about the Vision Pro, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-tech-specs/\">full tech specs</a> such as storage options up to 1TB, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/applecare-plus-for-vision-pro/\">AppleCare+ pricing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-releases-vision-pro-accessories/\">available accessories</a>, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Begins Selling Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watches Without Blood Oxygen Feature in U.S. Amid Dispute</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-without-blood-oxygen/\">Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S. no longer have a functional Blood Oxygen app</a> starting this week, allowing Apple to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/\">sidestep a sales ban</a> on these models. Previously-sold watches and models sold in other countries are not affected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-blood-oxygen-monitoring-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"897\" />\r<br />\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/\">ordered an import and sales ban</a> on Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after ruling that Apple violated Masimo's pulse oximetry patents. Masimo has accused Apple of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-masimo-legal-battle/\">stealing trade secrets and poaching employees</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a longer-term solution, Apple is reportedly working on changes to the Blood Oxygen app's algorithm in an attempt to avoid Masimo's patented technology, but it's unclear when these changes will be ready.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Releasing iOS 17.3 Next Week With These New Features</h2>\r<br />\nIn its press release <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/\">unveiling a new Black Unity Sport Band</a> for the Apple Watch, Apple confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-releasing-ios-17-3-next-week/\">iOS 17.3 will be released next week</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe software update includes a few new features and additions for the iPhone, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/\">Stolen Device Protection</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/\">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/ios-17-3-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/\">connect an iPhone to select hotel room TVs via AirPlay</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/\">Unity Bloom wallpaper</a> for the Lock Screen, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>U.S. Developers Can Now Offer Non-App Store Purchasing Option, But Apple Will Still Collect Commissions</h2>\r<br />\nIn adherence with a U.S. court ruling, Apple is now allowing App Store apps to feature a single link to a developer website that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/\">leads to an alternative payment option for in-app purchases</a>, but Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought in this manner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThis change comes after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/\">U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear both Apple's and Epic Games' appeals</a> in their trial related to App Store rules, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-wants-epic-games-legal-expenses/\">Apple now wants Epic to pay its legal fees</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Launch Internationally Before WWDC</h2>\r<br />\nApple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the Vision Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/\">will launch in additional countries beyond the U.S. by WWDC 2024 in June</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nApple previously announced that the Vision Pro would be released in additional countries later this year, but it did not list any specific countries. Canada, the UK, and other English-speaking nations are reportedly among the places where the headset is likely to launch next.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Vision Pro Virtual Keyboard Blasted As 'Complete Write-Off'</h2>\r<br />\nVision Pro's keyboard floats in mid-air, allowing you to input text in your spatial computing environment while wearing the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-vision-pro-virtual-keyboard.jpg\" width=\"1278\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\nHowever, anyone planning to ditch their physical keyboard may want to hold onto it for a little while longer. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-vision-pro-virtual-keyboard-criticism/\">virtual keyboard experience in visionOS 1.0 is \"a complete write-off,\"</a> and most people will want to use a Bluetooth keyboard instead.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jan-18-2024\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/top-stories-vision-pro-pre-orders/\">Top Stories: Vision Pro Pre-Orders, iOS 17.3 Release Date, Apple Watch Blood Oxygen Ban</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-vision-pro-pre-orders-ios-17-3-release-date-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-ban.2416891/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fd4a3f5ada66292d577747ce70c86ed698c62686f83d28acfe371163e5f77d69","category":"Apple"}
