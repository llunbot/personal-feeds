For the 14-core CPU, there are 10 performance cores and four efficiency cores.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-Pro.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe previous-generation M3 Pro chip has up to a 12-core CPU and up to an 18-core GPU.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the M4 Pro chip features \"the world's fastest CPU core\" with \"lightning-fast single-threaded performance.\" It also advertises the M4 Pro chip's graphics performance as being up to twice as fast as the standard M4 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not provided any direct comparisons between the M4 Pro and M3 Pro chips, so we will have to wait for benchmark results for that. However, in its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-shares-m4-mac-mini-announcement-video/\">Mac mini video announcement</a>, Apple says the M4 Pro chip's multi-core CPU performance is up to 1.6x faster than the M2 Pro chip and up to 1.9x faster than the M1 Pro chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-Pro-vs-M2-Pro.jpg\" width=\"5090\" height=\"2856\" />\r<br />\nOther specifications for the M4 Pro chip include Thunderbolt 5 support with up to 120 Gb/s data transfer speeds, and an increased 273GB/s of memory bandwidth. That is a 75% increase in memory bandwidth compared to the M3 Pro chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first Mac equipped with the M4 Pro chip is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">the new Mac mini</a>, also announced today. Apple is also expected to introduce updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chip options later this week.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-m4-pro-chip/\">M4 Pro Chip Announced: Up to 14-Core CPU and 20-Core GPU, Up to 64GB of RAM, Thunderbolt 5 Support, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-pro-chip-announced-up-to-14-core-cpu-and-20-core-gpu-up-to-64gb-of-ram-thunderbolt-5-support-and-more.2441276/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e0068f3a168d5b041a96c2ef1236906f0eb6b698fe42c996c75aa9d9ff8481f4","category":"Apple"}
