{"title":"tvOS 18.2 No Longer Expected to Include More Apple TV+ Screen Savers","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/28/no-movie-screen-savers-for-apple-tv/","date":1732831114000,"content":"The upcoming tvOS 18.2 update adds a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/tvos-18-2-snoopy-screen-savers/\">rotation of Snoopy screen savers</a> to 2021 and newer Apple TV models, but it seems that an additional <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/new-apple-tv-screen-savers-coming-soon/\">\"TV and Movies\" category of screen savers</a> has been canceled, or at least postponed. These screen savers were expected to be based on various Apple TV+ series and movies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-TV-Plus-Foundation.jpg\" width=\"1120\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nAs spotted by the <a href=\"https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/tvos-18-screensavers-apple-tv/\">Dutch blog <em>iCulture</em></a>, Apple removed all references to the \"TV and Movies\" screen savers on its website in mid-November, including a preview of a new screen saver based on the Apple TV+ series \"Foundation.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also updated fine print on its website, although only in the U.S. for now. Apple often takes longer to update its regional websites for other countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe previous fine print: <blockquote>Snoopy and TV and Movies screen savers coming late 2024.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current fine print: <blockquote>Snoopy screen saver coming late 2024.</blockquote>Snoopy is technically Apple TV+ content now, but it looks like additional Apple TV+ screen savers will not be coming any time soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe expect tvOS 18.2 to be released to the public in December. The rotating Snoopy screen saver is already available in the third beta version of the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther screen saver categories on the Apple TV include Aerials and Memories, along with a Portraits option with clocks added in tvOS 18.0.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/28/no-movie-screen-savers-for-apple-tv/\">tvOS 18.2 No Longer Expected to Include More Apple TV+ Screen Savers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-18-2-no-longer-expected-to-include-more-apple-tv-screen-savers.2444218/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c1e750fc2b088145b50eea675a6b2bbe5d9028e5f8a2caf7c4a3d92b99dc52a9","category":"Apple"}
