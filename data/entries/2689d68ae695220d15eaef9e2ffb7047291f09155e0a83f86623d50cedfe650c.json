Here’s why","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2574141/did-your-airpods-case-just-beep-heres-why.html","date":1736523562000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2022, Apple added a speaker to the AirPods Pro case to help find it when lost in a couch cushion or under a desk. But for years people have been hearing their cases make sounds all on their own. We finally know why–surprise, it’s not the case at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As spotted by MacRumors, Apple has <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/airpods/devd9aac5b42/web\">added an explanation for the occasional and unprompted noises made by AirPods</a>. Tucked way down in the “Use hearing health features with AirPods Pro 2” section of the AirPods User Guide, Apple explains that it’s not actually the case making a noise but rather the AirPods inside the case:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To help ensure that your AirPods microphones and speakers are operating at their best (for example, to help provide high-quality hearing test results), your AirPods may periodically play a quiet chime when they’re in their charging case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Users have wondered what the mysterious sound is, which sounds like a faraway chime as you can hear in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/1e77s1t/airpods_sometimes_making_strange_noise_when_i_put/\">the video on this Reddit thread</a>. It’s not clear what happens if the AirPods discover they’re not operating at their best, but they would presumably send an alert to your iPhone to let you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple added <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2498966/your-airpods-pro-2-can-now-work-as-a-hearing-aid-heres-how.html\">hearing protection features to the AirPods Pro</a>, which includes the “high-quality hearing test” described in Apple’s support note. It’s not clear whether Apple plans to bring it to other models with noise-cancellation, including the AirPods 4 and AirPods Max.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2689d68ae695220d15eaef9e2ffb7047291f09155e0a83f86623d50cedfe650c","category":"Apple"}
