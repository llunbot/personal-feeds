The video, shared on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cy1_SQErcRk/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jakekrol/video/7294071432944880938\">TikTok</a>, provides a first look at the sliding cap in action.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nPriced at $79, the new Apple Pencil is a more affordable option compared to the first-generation and second-generation Apple Pencil models, which remain available for $99 and $129, respectively. It has a similar design as the second-generation Apple Pencil, but it charges with a USB-C cable instead of wirelessly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Apple Pencil will be available to order in \"early November,\" but a specific release date has yet to be announced by Apple. It is compatible with all iPad models equipped with a USB-C port, including the lower-end tenth-generation iPad.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>This is your first look at the new Apple Pencil, the $79 one with a USB-C port. I got to demo it in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Freeform?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Freeform</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GetAnimatic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GetAnimatic</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/AnwnJfDxTN\">https://t.co/AnwnJfDxTN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MR0RPYpdV1\">pic.twitter.com/MR0RPYpdV1</a></p>â€” Jake Krol (@Jake31Krol) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jake31Krol/status/1717368263200399783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 26, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nGiven its lower price, the new Apple Pencil lacks three key features compared to the second-generation model, including wireless charging, pressure sensitivity, and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools. However, it does support the Apple Pencil hover feature with the latest 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on-video/\">New Apple Pencil's Hidden USB-C Port Demonstrated in Hands-On Video</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencils-hidden-usb-c-port-demonstrated-in-hands-on-video.2408700/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"004f806162691ed60e43d4b13d781e7ba690000a7530eb525283dbfab6f87e08","category":"Apple"}
