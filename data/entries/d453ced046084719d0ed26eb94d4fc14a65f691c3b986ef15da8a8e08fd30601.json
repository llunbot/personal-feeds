A device booted into recovery mode can't do anything by itself, but it can be connected to a working Mac or PC with a cable, and that Mac or PC can download a fresh copy of iOS and all of your phone's related firmware to restore it to a factory-default state. You'll need a backup to recover your personal data, but it beats having to take a trip to an Apple Store or send your phone in for repairs.</p>\n\n<p>The new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models launching this week apparently add a new option for phones that are in recovery mode: rudimentary wireless communication, so phones that need to be recovered can be placed near another iPhone or an iPad and be restored without using a cable, a PC, or Mac.</p>\n<p>The new system was <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/17/iphone-16-firmware-restored-wirelessly/\">tested by 9to5Mac</a>, which says it uses \"the same RecoveryOS that lets users restore Apple Watch and Apple TV firmware from an iPhone.\" When you place an iPhone 16 in recovery mode near another device, the functioning device will download the software and firmware files and then transfer them to the broken phone, where they can be installed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050576#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050576&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d453ced046084719d0ed26eb94d4fc14a65f691c3b986ef15da8a8e08fd30601","category":"Tech"}
