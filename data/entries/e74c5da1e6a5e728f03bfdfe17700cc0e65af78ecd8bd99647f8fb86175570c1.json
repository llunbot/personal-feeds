As you'd expect from a third-party app, no YouTube account is required to use Juno, and it won't auto-skip ads, but YouTube Premium subscribers will enjoy the benefits that accompany the tier through the app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSelig cautions that early adopters of the app may encounter a few bugs, since he has only been able to develop and interact with it in the Vision Pro simulator. But that's unlikely to concern users who are familiar with the developer's reputation and engagement with people who use his apps. Plus, he's getting a Vision Pro headset today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>And here's a quick overview video showing it in action.
