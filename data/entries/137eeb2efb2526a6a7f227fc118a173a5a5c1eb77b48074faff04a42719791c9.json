He was at home in\nPortola Valley in his bed, surrounded by family. We will miss him\ngreatly, and he will be missed by many of you, too. He was a\nremarkable person, and the world will be forever different because\nhe lived in it. He was fascinated by consciousness, and as he has\npassed on to a different level of consciousness, we wish him a\njourney as meaningful as the one it has been to have him in our\nlives. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, stepson,\nstepdaughter, two brothers, four sisters, and dog, Poppy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the great heroes in not just Apple history, but computer history. If you want to cheer yourself up, go to Andy Hertzfeld’s Folklore.org site and (re-)read all the entries about Atkinson. Here’s just one, with <a href=\"https://folklore.org/Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.html\">Steve Jobs inspiring Atkinson to invent the roundrect</a>. Some of his code and algorithms are among the most efficient and elegant ever devised. The original Macintosh team was chock full of geniuses, but Atkinson might have been the most essential to making the impossible possible under the extraordinary technical limitations of that hardware. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=bill+atkinson+dithering+algorithm\">Atkinson’s genius dithering algorithm</a> was my inspiration for the name of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_dithering\">Dithering</a>, my podcast with Ben Thompson. I find that effect beautiful and love that it continues to prove useful, like on the <a href=\"https://play.date/\">Playdate</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/10/bitcam\">apps like BitCam</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What a man, what a mind.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/07/bill-atkinson-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"137eeb2efb2526a6a7f227fc118a173a5a5c1eb77b48074faff04a42719791c9","category":"Tech"}
