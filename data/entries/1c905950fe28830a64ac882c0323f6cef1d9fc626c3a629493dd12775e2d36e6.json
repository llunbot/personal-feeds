The way he thought was profoundly\nbeautiful.</p>\n\n<p>He was without doubt the most inquisitive human I have ever met.\nHis insatiable curiosity was not limited or distracted by his\nknowledge or expertise, nor was it casual or passive. It was\nferocious, energetic and restless. His curiosity was practiced\nwith intention and rigor.</p>\n\n<p>Many of us have an innate predisposition to be curious. I believe\nthat after a traditional education, or working in an environment\nwith many people, curiosity is a decision requiring intent and\ndiscipline.</p>\n\n<p>In larger groups our conversations gravitate towards the tangible,\nthe measurable. It is more comfortable, far easier and more\nsocially acceptable talking about what is known. Being curious and\nexploring tentative ideas were far more important to Steve than\nbeing socially acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>Our curiosity begs that we learn. And for Steve, wanting to learn\nwas far more important than wanting to be right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/05/ive-jobs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1c905950fe28830a64ac882c0323f6cef1d9fc626c3a629493dd12775e2d36e6","category":"Tech"}
