The week-long stage race got underway yesterday, with Denmark’s Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) winning the first stage around Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His time in the yellow jersey would be short-lived, however. On a challenging Stage 2 route that finished on the 1,251m Col de la Loge, Pedersen would be dropped to the tune of four minutes, with countryman Magnus Cort Nielsen (Uno-X) winning in the mist to take over the race lead, four seconds ahead of Primož Roglič (Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=15&amp;y=2024&amp;s=2\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/anna-shackley-retires\">British rising star Anna Shackley forced to retire from professional cycling at 22 years old</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-preview\">Critérium du Dauphiné 2024: Route, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Miguel Ángel López receives four-year ban for Menotropin</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Miguel-Angel-Lopez-by-Luis-Angel-Gomez-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Luis Angel Gomez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Miguel Ángel López has been banned for four years for the possession and use of prohibited substance Mentropin prior to the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>. The Colombian abandoned the race on Stage 4 but went on to finish fourth overall at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> later in the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astana severed ties with the Colombian in December that year after his alleged links to Spanish doctor Marcos Maynar – who is under investigation for being part of a doping ring through ‘Operation Ilex’ – were revealed. López was initially suspended on 25th July 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Racing at the time for Continental squad Team Medellin-EPM, López had just won the 2023 Vuelta a Colombia, taking eight out of nine stages in the process and winning the points and mountains classifications too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has a month to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anna Shackley to take up DS role</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>The very promising career of Anna Shackley was very sadly ended prematurely due to health issues earlier this year, however, Anna is now focussed on remaining in the sport, albeit in a different role as a Director Sportive.
