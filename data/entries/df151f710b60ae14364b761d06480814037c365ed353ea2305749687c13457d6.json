With the return of the Tour comes predictions, speculation, rumour and guessing games of who will win the 2024 Tour de France. But why stab in the dark? Whether you go by consensus or bookmakers, there are clear favourites to win the famous <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-an-icon-100-years-of-the-tour-de-frances-yellow-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">yellow jersey</a> and clear contenders to either challenge for that final podium spot or take their chance if the top two don’t make it to Paris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders are desperately searching for<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-underdogs\" target=\"_blank\"> underdog status</a> ahead of this year’s Tour de France. A crash-marred spring and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-do-tour-de-france-favourites-prepare\" target=\"_blank\">unfavourable preparations</a> have meant that many riders are starting the Tour de France on disagreeable terms. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">With only a couple of days to go until the race starts in Florence</a>, the clock is ticking for the favourites to get their act together ahead of the big send-off in Tuscany.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By merging <a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/cycling/tour-de-france/winner\" target=\"_blank\">bookmakers’ consensus</a> and GC record, we’ve considered every genuine contender who could feasibly win the general classification in the men’s Tour de France 2024 and assessed their chances. Consider it a stab in the light. Our own predictions will follow later this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour de France 2024 favourites</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Barring incident, the yellow jersey will be worn by one of two men in Nice. You know them well after watching them clash over the past three Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jonas Vingegaard</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-84.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>UNIPUBLIC / SPRINT CYCLING AGENCYSprintCyclingAgency©2023</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard </a>has a lot to prove at this year’s Tour de France. After <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-itzulia-broadcast\" target=\"_blank\">a serious crash at Itzulia Basque Country</a> this spring, the two-time Tour champion has had a far from ideal build-up to his defence. Now even with Pogačar on two Tour wins apiece, Vingegaard will be hungry to prove that <em>he </em>is the best Tour de France rider of the 2020s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, Vingegaard looked unstoppable. A pragmatic Tour de France crescendoed in the Alps with a monstrous time-trial victory on Stage 16 in Combloux. He laid the final nails in the coffin of Pogačar’s chances on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-de-la-loze-cycling-2\" target=\"_blank\">Col de la Loze</a> where he extended his lead by almost seven minutes. In Tour terms, it was seismic. If it weren’t for that crash in the spring, Vingegaard would be the out-and-out favourite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Visma-Lease a Bike squad looks strong. Paris-Nice winner Matteo Jorgenson will be backed up in the mountain train by 2020 Giro podium finisher Wilco Kelderman and Slovenian Jan Tratnik. Wout van Aert returns from injury to prop up this team alongside Christophe Laporte on the hilly profiles. The only slight issue is Sepp Kuss’s late removal from the squad due to illness, he’s replaced by Bart Lemmen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dane’s recent crashes will cloud all speculation, but <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-do-tour-de-france-favourites-prepare\" target=\"_blank\">he has been training again</a> and seems fit enough to race. In due course, we will see the return of the ruthless Vingegaard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tadej Pogačar</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2086697719-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bookies’ favourite is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\">Tadej Pogačar</a>. This is for good reason, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\" target=\"_blank\">he is the best cyclist around at the moment</a>. The Slovenian has previously won two Tours de France and already has a Grand Tour under his belt this year. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-mens-cycling-2024\" target=\"_blank\">He looks untouchable </a>on the climbs and his squad is packed full of talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar was in imperious form earlier this season with Classics wins at Strade Bianche and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-monument-ranking\" target=\"_blank\">Liège-Bastogne-Liège</a>. He took this form into the Giro d’Italia where he clinched six stage wins and the overall classification. It looked like the best Pogačar we’ve seen to date, but without a top-tier favourite to compete against, it was hard to know if he was Tour-level competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the discourse last year was clouded by Pogačar’s wrist injury. There was also plenty of talk about him learning from his mistakes after being outplayed by Jumbo-Visma in 2022. What we saw last year was a man burnt out by the final week and Vingegaard saw his chance and took it. If Pogačar has improved on this flaw, then we could see the Slovenian <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-tour-double\">claim the Giro-Tour double</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UAE Team Emirates have brought a horrifyingly strong team. Pogačar will be backed by three Grand Tour podium finishers in the form of João Almeida, Juan Ayuso and third place finisher last year Adam Yates. The climbing support goes deeper still with Pavel Sivakov, Marc Soler and Tim Wellens. Will this team be enough? Has Pogačar learned from the last two Tours? Is he actually better than ever? We’ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour de France 2024: The B-Tier contenders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below Pogačar and Vingegaard sit the other two Grand Tour galacticos: Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič. The duo have clashed over the past two seasons, first meeting at the 2022 Vuelta. They renewed their rivalry throughout the spring of 2023 at the Volta a Catalunya and later the Giro d’Italia. Their paths have crossed already in 2024 at Paris-Nice and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Critérium du Dauphiné</a>. Both have Grand Tour wins on their <em>palmarès</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Primož Roglič</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-34.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a move in the winter to Bora-Hansgrohe – soon to be renamed to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a> – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> will return to the Tour de France after being absent last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slovenian <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grand-tour-comebacks\" target=\"_blank\">infamously crumbled on La Planche des Belles Fille in 2020</a>, becoming Tadej Pogačar’s first victim on the roads of the Tour de France. The following two years, Roglič crashed out of the race, failing to make it to Paris. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since his abandonment in 2022, the former ski jumper has clocked some big results, including a Giro d’Italia win in 2023. In 2024, Roglič has been back to winning ways. After an underwhelming Paris-Nice, Roglič refound his mojo at the Critérium du Dauphiné in typical Roglič style. The Bora leader claimed two mountain stages before almost losing the race on the final day to Matteo Jorgenson. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>parcours</em> suits Roglič. A favourable amount of time-trialling in the first week and a couple of Roglič-tailored hilly stages could suit the Slovenian. Alongside Giro champion Jai Hindley and former top five finisher Sasha Vlasov, Bora are taking their chances seriously. Roglič hasn’t beaten Vingegaard or Pogačar since changing teams, but that could all start at the Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Remco Evenepoel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-76.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From Belgium, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> will provide cycling’s cultural homeland with a Tour contender. At the age of 24, Evenepoel will be making his long-awaited Tour de France debut this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far in 2024, Evenepoel has had a less-than-ideal run-up to the Grand Boucle. A crash in Itzulia Basque Country saw the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> leader break his collarbone. Not long after, Evenepoel returned to racing at the Dauphiné. There, he earned a stage win and a top-ten finish in the GC. His climbing results were not convincing, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remco will enter the Tour de France as the reigning world time-trial champion. These capabilities will come in handy on Stage 7’s long time-trial around Burgundy’s vineyards. Otherwise, he will look to capitalise on his good Classics legs early with the rolling profiles of the Italian Grand Départ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He starts the Tour alongside Basque nearly-man Mikel Landa and doppelgänger Ilan van Wilder as mountain support. QuickStep have never won the Tour de France, usually opting for sprint finishes and breakaway exploits. The Evenepoel project has a lot resting on it and his Tour discovery will be telling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>3/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour de France 2024: Outside bets</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Tour de France – as with any bike race – anything can happen. We’ve seen plenty of pre-race favourites crash out early on in the past.
