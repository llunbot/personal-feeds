This is a mid-range phone with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2. It costs $550 and will be in stores June 20. Every Motorola phone nowadays <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/the-2024-moto-g-stylus-is-a-400-mid-ranger-with-vegan-leather/\">looks</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-2024-moto-g-power-packs-wireless-charging-8gb-ram-in-a-300-phone/\">exactly</a> <a href=\"https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-play-gen-3/p?skuId=1041\">the same</a>, but Motorola assures us this is new.</p>\n<p>The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 is the bottom of Qualcomm's \"7 series\" lineup and features four Cortex-A78 cores and four Cortex-A55 cores built on a 4 nm manufacturing process. The phone has a 144 Hz, 6.6-inch 2400×1080 OLED panel with curved sides. It has 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 5000 mAh battery, 68 W wired charging, and 15 W wireless charging. Cameras include a mid-range 50 MP Sony \"<a href=\"https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/info/2023/2023061501.html\">LYTIA</a>\" 700C, 13 MP wide-angle, and a 32 MP front camera. The phone has NFC, Wi-Fi 6E, an in-screen fingerprint reader, and—a big addition compared to other Motorola devices—an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>\n<p>Just like on the Moto G Stylus, this phone has a \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/the-2024-moto-g-stylus-is-a-400-mid-ranger-with-vegan-leather/\">vegan leather</a>\" back option that should be softer than the usual plastic, but it's still plastic. Unlike that phone, there's no headphone jack or MicroSD slot. A customizable hardware button on the left side of the phone lets you open the Google Assistant or whatever other app you choose.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029197#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029197&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bd3861578e8d59261485f418418ea90ded39d2d1eeeca263d00828cc8f7559b5","category":"Tech"}
