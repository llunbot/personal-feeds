As the name suggests, it pays homage to historical ATB tires while giving it a modern twist, and has repeatedly evolved while being compatible with various sizes.</p>\n<p>Finally, in 700 x 43 mm and 650 x 55 mm sizes, the model has been officially updated to be officially tubeless compatible.</p>\n<p>This update in specification comes after repeated calls from end users and dealers, who are looking for more tubeless compatible options as the industry continues to embrace the standard as beneficial for riders looking to run lower tire pressures to improve ride quality, and contact patch traction. Until now, The Homage construction was not conducive for setting up tubeless.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-04.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-04.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The updated specification has reinforced the sidewall casing, and slightly adjusted the bead shape for a more airtight fit between tire and rim. As with all SimWorks tires, adhering to ERTRO standards for rim channel depth and hook presence is necessary for safe and secure tire interface.</p>\n<p>Weight increases from the previous version are minimal (approx. 45 g for 700 and 75 for 650b) while offering greater sidewall puncture protection. SimWorks looks to offer products that fit in a niche of timeless bike products, leaning into time-tested standards that reflect a classic aesthetic and no-frills specifications.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SimWorks_The_Homage_Tire-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wheel Size : 700c (622) &amp; 650b (584)</li>\n<li>Tire Width : 700x43mm, 650x55mm</li>\n<li>Bead : Aramid</li>\n<li>Compound : ZSG Natural Compound</li>\n<li>Recommended<br />\npressure:</li>\n<li>Max 400kPa / 60psi</li>\n<li>Weight : 575g (700c x 43) / 700g (650b x 55)</li>\n<li>Price: $75 USD/each</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.sim.works/products/the-homage-tire-tubeless-650b-700c\" target=\"_blank\">SimWorks</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/simworks-the-homage-tires-tubeless-compatible/\">SimWorks The Homage Tires Are Now Fully Tubeless Compatible</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"37d865da86dd73ee96ede036d1f64086d2b0bae4ebb1895d488c6902115aa1c3","category":"Cycling"}
