Followed on Monday 20th by the U23 time trial later the same day, we’ll also find out who will be the next Elite Women’s time trial champion.</p>\n<p>Likely to draw many viewers for its novelty alone, the Team Time Trial mixed relay comes on Wednesday 22nd September. The Men’s under-23 road race takes place on Friday 24th September. A lead into the big weekend of racing, this is followed by the Elite Women’s road race on Saturday 25th September and finally the men’s Elite road race, which closes proceedings on Sunday.</p>\n<p>While the time trial events are pan-flat, the road racing courses seek out as many of the region’s hills as possible. Despite largely avoiding Flanders' more storied climbs, the organisers have still created routes that will suit punchy riders and should make for exciting and distinctly Belgian-style racing.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10017/flanders-uci-road-cycling-world-championships-2021-key-information\">Flanders UCI Road Cycling World Championships 2021: Key information</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10101/how-to-watch-uci-world-championships\">How to watch the UCI World Championships 2021: Full schedule for live TV and highlights</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10098/who-are-the-favourites-for-the-elite-mens-road-world-championships-2021\">Who are the favourites for the elite men's road World Championships 2021?</a></div>    </div></div><h2>How can I watch the 2021 UCI World Championships?</h2>\n<p>All events will be aired in the UK and around Europe on Eurosport and all the elite action will also be shown live on BBC Two.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elite men’s individual time trial: Sunday 19th September</strong></h3>\n<p>1320-1625, live coverage, Eurosport 1<br />\n1900-2000, highlights, Eurosport 1</p>\n<p>1330-1615, live coverage, BBC Two</p>\n<h3><strong>Elite women’s individual time trial: Monday 20th September</strong></h3>\n<p>1330-1600, live coverage, Eurosport 1<br />\n2000-2100, highlights, Eurosport 1</p>\n<p>1330-1545, live coverage, BBC Two</p>\n<h3><strong>Men’s U23 time trial: Monday 20th September</strong></h3>\n<p>1300-1335, live coverage, Eurosport 1<br />\n1900-2000, highlights, Eurosport 1</p>\n<h3><strong>Elite mixed team time trial: Wednesday 22nd September</strong></h3>\n<p>1320-1550, live coverage, Eurosport 1<br />\n2000-2100, highlights, Eurosport 1</p>\n<p>1325-1605, live coverage, BBC Red Button</p>\n<h3><strong>Elite women’s road race: Saturday 25th September</strong></h3>\n<p>1100-1630, live coverage, Eurosport 1<br />\n1900-2000, highlights, Eurosport 2</p>\n<p>1120-1615, uninterrupted live coverage, BBC Red Button<br />\n1400-1615, BBC Two</p>\n<h3><strong>Elite men’s road race: Sunday 26th September</strong></h3>\n<p>0900-1645, live coverage, Eurosport 1<br />\n1900-2000, highlights, Eurosport 2</p>\n<p>0925-1700, uninterrupted live coverage, BBC Red Button<br />\n1440-1700, live coverage, BBC Two</p>\n<p>Schedules and coverage times are subject to late changes. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/events\">Events</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"81dba895df400f3b2c09aa115c3fea8a68f6e55b3edc6a8c11c5758c4e52b3a0","category":"Cycling"}
