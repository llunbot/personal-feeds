{"title":"In the works – AWS South America (Chile) Region","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-soon-aws-south-america-chile-region/","date":1746624888000,"content":"<p>Today, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> announced plans to launch a new <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/\">AWS Region</a> in Chile by the end of 2026. The AWS South America (Chile) Region will consist of three <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-availability-zones.html\">Availability Zones</a> at launch, bringing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/\">AWS infrastructure</a> and services closer to customers in Chile. This new Region joins the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-south-america-sao-paulo-region-ec2-s3-and-lots-more/\">AWS South America (São Paulo)</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-mexico-central-region/\">AWS Mexico (Central) Regions</a> as our third AWS Region in Latin America. Each Availability Zone is separated by a meaningful distance to support applications that need low latency while significantly reducing the risk of a single event impacting availability.</p> \n<div>\n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/22/Chile_Blog_Image_5mb.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" />\n <p>Skyline of Santiago de Chile with modern office buildings in the financial district in Las Condes</p>\n</div> \n<p>The new AWS Region will bring advanced cloud technologies, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/artificial-intelligence/\">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/\">machine learning (ML)</a>, closer to customers in Latin America. Through high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections over dedicated, fully redundant fiber, the Region will support applications requiring synchronous replication while giving you the flexibility to run workloads and store data locally to meet data residency requirements.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS in Chile</strong></span><br /> In 2017, AWS established an office in Santiago de Chile to support local customers and partners. Today, there are business development teams, solutions architects, partner managers, professional services consultants, support staff, and personnel in various other roles working in the Santiago office.</p> \n<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to Chile, AWS has invested in several infrastructure offerings throughout the country. In 2019, AWS launched an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/10/cloudfront-south-america-200-edge-location/\">Amazon CloudFront edge location in Chile</a>. This provides a highly secure and programmable content delivery network that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide with low latency and high transfer speeds.</p> \n<p>AWS strengthened its presence in 2021 with two significant additions. First, an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/aws-ground-station-antenna-location-punta-arenas-preview/\">AWS Ground Station antenna location in Punta Arenas</a>, offering a fully managed service for satellite communications, data processing, and global satellite operations scaling. Second, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/announcing-availability-aws-outposts-argentina-chile-peru/\">AWS Outposts in Chile</a>, bringing fully managed AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a consistent hybrid experience.</p> \n<p>In 2023, AWS further enhanced its infrastructure with two key developments, an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/aws-direct-connect-location-santiago-chile/\">AWS Direct Connect location in Chile</a> that lets you create private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/01/general-availability-aws-local-zones-perth-santiago/\">AWS Local Zones in Santiago</a>, placing compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population centers and IT hubs. The AWS Local Zone in Santiago helps customers deliver applications requiring single-digit millisecond latency to end users.</p> \n<p>The upcoming AWS South America (Chile) Region represents our continued commitment to fueling innovation in Chile. Beyond building infrastructure, AWS plays a crucial role in developing Chile’s digital workforce through comprehensive cloud education initiatives. Through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/\">AWS Academy</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate\">AWS Educate</a>, and <a href=\"https://skillbuilder.aws/\">AWS Skill Builder</a>, AWS provides essential cloud computing skills to diverse groups—from students and developers to business professionals and emerging IT leaders. Since 2017, AWS has trained more than two million people across Latin America on cloud skills, including more than 100,000 in Chile.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS customers in Chile</strong></span><br /> AWS customers in Chile have been increasingly moving their applications to AWS and running their technology infrastructure in AWS Regions around the world. With the addition of this new AWS Region, customers will be able to provide even lower latency to end users and use advanced technologies such as generative AI, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile services, banking industry, and more, to drive innovation. This Region will give AWS customers the ability to run their workloads and store their content in Chile.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of customers in Chile using AWS to drive innovation:</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://digital.gob.cl/\">Digital Government Secretariat (SGD)</a> is the Chilean government institution responsible for proposing and coordinating the implementation of the Digital Government Strategy, providing an integrated government approach. SGD coordinates, advises, and provides cross-sector support in the strategic use of digital technologies, data, and public information to improve state administration and service delivery. To fulfill this mission, SGD relies on AWS to operate critical digital platforms including<a href=\"https://claveunica.gob.cl/\"> Clave Única (single sign-on)</a>, <a href=\"https://firma.digital.gob.cl/\">FirmaGob (digital signature)</a>, the <a href=\"https://portal.pisee.cl/\">State Electronic Services Integration Platform (PISEE)</a>, <a href=\"https://doc.digital.gob.cl/\">DocDigital</a>, <a href=\"https://simple.gob.cl/\">SIMPLE</a>, and the <a href=\"https://cpat.gob.cl/\">Administrative Procedures and Services Catalog (CPAT)</a>, among others.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://transbank.cl/\">Transbank</a>, Chile’s largest payment solutions ecosystem managing the largest percentage of national transactions, used AWS to significantly reduce time-to-market for new products. Moreover, Transbank implemented multiple AWS-powered solutions, enhancing team productivity and accelerating innovation. These initiatives showcase how financial technology companies can use AWS to drive innovation and operational efficiency. “The new AWS Region in Chile will be very important for us,” said Jorge Rodríguez M., Chief Architecture and Technology Officer (CA&amp;TO) of Transbank. “It will further reduce latency, improve security and expand the possibilities for innovation, allowing us to serve our customers with new and better services and products.”</p> \n<p>To learn more about AWS customers in Chile, visit <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/browse-customer-success-stories/?customer-references-cards.q=chile&amp;customer-references-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&amp;customer-references-cards.sort-order=desc&amp;customer-references-cards.q_operator=AND&amp;awsf.customer-references-location=*all&amp;awsf.customer-references-industry=*all&amp;awsf.customer-references-use-case=*all&amp;awsf.language=language%23spanish&amp;awsf.customer-references-segment=*all&amp;awsf.content-type=*all&amp;awsf.customer-references-product=*all\">AWS Customer Success Stories</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS sustainability efforts in Chile</strong></span><br /> AWS is committed to water stewardship in Chile through innovative conservation projects. In the Maipo Basin, which provides essential water for the Metropolitan Santiago and Valparaiso regions, AWS has partnered with local farmers and <a href=\"https://kilimo.com\">climate-tech company Kilimo</a> to implement water-saving initiatives. The project involves converting 67 hectares of agricultural land from flood to drip irrigation, which will save approximately 200 million liters of water annually.</p> \n<p>This water conservation effort supports AWS commitment to be water positive by 2030 and demonstrates our dedication to environmental sustainability in the communities where AWS operate. The project uses efficient drip irrigation systems that deliver water directly to plant root systems through a specialized pipe network, maximizing water efficiency for agricultural use.
