His final race for the team is scheduled to be Il Lombardia on 7th October. The 33-year-old has spent eight years with the Dutch squad and amassed a palmar√®s that includes the Giro d‚ÄôItalia, three Vueltas a Espa√±a (plus 12 individual stages), Tirreno-Adriatico, Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© and Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge.

As the race entered the final phase of a sprint finish, De Lie surged ahead of the pack in the last 50m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His right shoe unclipped and he couldn‚Äôt get it back in at such high speed. He persevered with one leg, the finish line in sight. Behind, Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Florian S√©n√©chal (Soudal-QuickStep) were closing in. No matter. De Lie‚Äôs bike throw with one leg in the air not only produced a photo for the ages, but his tenth win of the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterwards, De Lie said, ‚Äò[It was] a crazy finish. I broke my pedal, my chain fell off, but luckily I still got it onto the big ring.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

The Tour de Vend√©e (won by Arnaud D√©mare) marked the last road race of his illustrious career as he turns his focus onto mountain bike racing. In his retirement announcement in January, Sagan said he would finish his career on the mountain bike because he started his career on the mountain bike. The Slovakian is hoping to represent his country in the XCO discipline at the 2024 Olympics in Paris should he gain enough points to qualify. He competed in the mountain bike event at the 2016 Rio Olympics but punctured on the second lap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagan enjoyed a fruitful road career with an entertaining flourish; whether it was winning seven points classifications at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> and dyeing his beard green for the occasion or pulling wheelies up <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-alpe-d-huez\" target=\"_blank\">Alpe d‚ÄôHuez</a>.
