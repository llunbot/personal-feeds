It has now announced the detection of a signal indicating a merger between two compact objects, one of which has an unusual intermediate mass—heavier than a neutron star and lighter than a black hole. The collaboration provided specifics of their analysis of the merger and the \"mystery object\" in a draft manuscript <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04248\">posted to</a> the physics arXiv, suggesting that the object might be a very low-mass black hole.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/danish-physicists-claim-to-cast-doubt-on-detection-of-gravitational-waves/\">LIGO detects</a> gravitational waves via <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/ligos-gravitational-wave-detection-takes-home-a-nobel/\">laser interferometry</a>, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington state, and in Livingston, Louisiana. A third detector in Italy, <a href=\"http://www.ego-gw.it/virgodescription/pag_4.html\">Advanced VIRGO</a>, came online in 2016. In Japan, KAGRA is the first gravitational-wave detector in Asia and the first to be built underground. Construction began on LIGO-India in 2021, and physicists expect it will turn on sometime after 2025.</p>\n<p>To date, the collaboration has detected dozens of merger events since its first <a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-2017-nobel-prize\">Nobel Prize-winning discovery</a>. Early detected mergers involved either two black holes or two neutron stars, but in 2021, LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA confirmed the detection of two separate \"mixed\" mergers between black holes and neutron stars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015392#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a2b54e22591adb524f78d3f84919fedebd0705d485a30e1b9d894b318d18f145","category":"Tech"}
