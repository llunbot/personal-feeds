A prototype version of Canyon’s K.I.S steering stabiliser was also seen and new SRAM Code brakes look to be in the works.</p>\n<p>Read on for full details on all of this and more.</p>\n<p>We’ve also got a full gallery of the best XC tech from Lenzerheide coming.

The adjustable system is concealed within the top tube on the production bike.</p>\n<p>The K.I.S system attaches the steerer of the fork to a set of coil springs via a super-strong synthetic fibre band. This provides a self-centring effect on the bars that helps to improve stability, both in a straight line and in corners.</p>\n<p>We can certainly see the appeal of a little extra composure at high speed on a track as fast as Lenzerheide.</p>\n<p>As far as we could tell, Troy seems to be the only Canyon CLLCTV rider running the system, on his otherwise standard <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-canyon-sender-cfr/\">Sender CFR</a>.</p>\n<h2>LoÏc Bruni’s top-secret Specialized Demo</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lenzerheide Downhill Bike Tech 2023 – prototype Specialized Demo\" title=\"Lenzerheide Downhill Bike Tech 2023 – prototype Specialized Demo\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Look at the size of that chainstay!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Finlay Anderson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Despite a full season’s worth of teasing, we’re still no closer to seeing exactly what hides under the bonnet of Loïc Bruni’s prototype Specialized Demo.</p>\n<p>However, while teammate Finn Iles was still using a neoprene sleeve, Bruni’s Demo was equipped with a 3D-printed cover, which revealed a little more of the prototype Demo’s frame.</p>\n<p>The huge alloy chainstays are the key talking point.

A similar design is used on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/atherton-bikes/\">Atherton Bikes’ production bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>We imagine this approach is employed to enable Specialized to test different frame geometries or designs in a relatively short space of time without having to invest in a full carbon mould.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lenzerheide Downhill Bike Tech 2023 – prototype Specialized Demo\" title=\"Lenzerheide Downhill Bike Tech 2023 – prototype Specialized Demo\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We reckon the three-button controller controls the compression damping of the bike’s suspension system.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Finlay Anderson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Also worth noting is the three-button electronic controller mounted under Bruni’s left-hand grip.
