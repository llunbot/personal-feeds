{"title":"Adobe unveils AI video generator trained on licensed content","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/adobe-unveils-ai-video-generator-trained-on-licensed-content/","date":1728942503000,"content":"<p>On Monday, Adobe <a href=\"https://news.adobe.com/news/2024/10/101424-adobe-launches-firefly-video-model\">announced</a> Firefly Video Model, a new AI-powered text-to-video generation tool that can create novel videos from written prompts. It joins similar offerings from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/we-made-a-cat-drink-a-beer-with-runways-ai-video-generator-and-it-sprouted-hands/\">Runway</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-unveils-veo-a-high-definition-ai-video-generator-that-may-rival-sora/\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/metas-new-movie-gen-ai-system-can-deepfake-video-from-a-single-photo/\">Meta</a> in an increasingly crowded field. Unlike the competition, Adobe claims that Firefly Video Model is trained exclusively on licensed content, potentially sidestepping ethical and copyright issues that have plagued other generative AI tools.</p>\n<p>Because of its licensed training data roots, Adobe calls <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly/features/ai-video-generator.html\">Firefly Video Model</a> \"the first publicly available video model designed to be commercially safe.\" However, the San Jose, California-based software firm hasn't announced a general release date, and during a beta test period, it's only granting access to people on a waiting list.</p>\n<figure>\n  <div>\n    An example video of Adobe's Firefly Video Model, provided by Adobe.\n  </div>\n\n  <figcaption>\n    <span></span>\n    <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      An example video of Adobe's Firefly Video Model, provided by Adobe.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>In the works since at least <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/adobe-teases-generative-ai-video-tools/\">April 2023</a>, the new model builds off of techniques Adobe developed for its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ethical-ai-art-generation-adobe-firefly-may-be-the-answer/\">Firefly</a> image synthesis models. Like its text-to-image generator, which the company later <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/adobe-photoshops-new-generative-fill-ai-tool-lets-you-manipulate-photos-with-text/\">integrated</a> into Photoshop, Adobe hopes to aim Firefly Video Model at media professionals, such as video creators and editors. The company claims its model can produce footage that blends seamlessly with traditionally created video content.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/adobe-unveils-ai-video-generator-trained-on-licensed-content/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/adobe-unveils-ai-video-generator-trained-on-licensed-content/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e673b7180640ebc09f7c61b8f838eff0b44f26b5a4d2677990c579b1f45d8cf","category":"Tech"}
