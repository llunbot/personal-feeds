A variety of configurations and color options are available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the usual accessories are included in the box, including a Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, power adapter and cord, and USB-C to Lightning cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says it puts refurbished Macs through \"full functionality testing\" and a \"thorough cleaning process and inspection,\" and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple.
