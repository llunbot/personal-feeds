Here, in our best Mac for students guide, we take a look at Apple’s current line-up to evaluate which Mac is best for students. We’ll compare the MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro for college and examine whether another Mac might actually be a better choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the best Mac for college or university depends on what you are going to be studying as well as how much you have to spend. Luckily registered students can save money on a new Mac by shopping at Apple’s Education Store, or with one of Apple’s partners. We discuss <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">How to get an Apple student discount at Apple’s Education Store</a> separately, although we also talk about the different ways you can save money as a student below.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save hundreds on a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and even a Mac Pro at Apple’s Education Store all year round.

Savings are even bigger on high-end products like the Mac Pro, although we aren’t sure that many students need one of those. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Product</strong></th><th>U.S.</th><th>U.K.</th><th>Australia</th><th>Canada</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>13.3-inch MacBook Air, M1, MSRP</td><td>$999</td><td>£999</td><td>$1,499</td><td>$1,299</td></tr><tr><td>13.3-inch MacBook Air, M1, Student discount</td><td>$899</td><td>£899</td><td>$1,349</td><td>$1,169</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2, MSRP</td><td>$1,099</td><td>£1,149</td><td>$1,799</td><td>$1,449</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2, Student discount</td><td>$999</td><td>£1,049</td><td>$1,649</td><td>$1,299</td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air, M2, MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,399</td><td>$2,199</td><td>$1,749</td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air, M2, Student discount</td><td>$1,199</td><td>£1,289</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$1,599</td></tr><tr><td>13-inch MacBook Pro MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,349</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$1,699</td></tr><tr><td>13-inch MacBook Pro Student discount</td><td>$1,199</td><td>£1,249</td><td>$1,849</td><td>$1,574</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro MSRP</td><td>$1,999</td><td>£2,149</td><td>$3,199</td><td>$2,599</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro Student discount</td><td>$1,849</td><td>£1,989</td><td>$2,959</td><td>$2,399</td></tr><tr><td>16-inch MacBook Pro MSRP</td><td>$2,499</td><td>£2,699</td><td>$3,999</td><td>$3,199</td></tr><tr><td>16-inch MacBook Pro Student discount</td><td>$2,299</td><td>£2,479</td><td>$3,679</td><td>$2,939</td></tr><tr><td>iMac MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,399</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$1,699</td></tr><tr><td>iMac Student discount</td><td>$1,249</td><td>£1,349</td><td>$1,919</td><td>$1,629</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini MSRP</td><td>$599</td><td>£649</td><td>$999</td><td>$799</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini Student discount</td><td>$499</td><td>£539</td><td>$829</td><td>$669</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Studio MSRP</td><td>$1,999</td><td>£2,099</td><td>$3,299</td><td>$2,699</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Studio Student discount</td><td>$1,799</td><td>£1,889</td><td>$2,969</td><td>$2,429</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Pro MSRP</td><td>$6,999</td><td>£7,199</td><td>$11,999</td><td>$8,999</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Pro Student discount</td><td>$6,599</td><td>£6,789</td><td>$11,309</td><td>$8,479</td></tr><tr><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Apple’s discounted price for students compared to the usual price.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro for college/university?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-M2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro with M2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-M2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-M2.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-M2.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-M2.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-M2.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" /><figcaption>The M2 MacBook Air and M2 MacBook Pro side by side</figcaption></figure><p> </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s likely that this is the question you are hoping to get an answer to: should I buy a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro for college?

The model we are recommending here is not the cheapest MacBook Air, but it offers the best value for money and the price difference between this and the older M1 model is so small that it is one of those cases where spending a little more gets you a lot more. This is even more true since Apple reduced the price of this June 2022 MacBook Air in June 2023. </p>\n\n<p>This MacBook Air offers 18 hours of battery life, according to Apple. This is less than the 13-inch MacBook Pro’s 20 hours, but it is bound to be more than enough to get you through a day and an all-nighter at university.</p>\n\n<p>There are no USB-A ports on the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, just two USB-C and a headphone jack. However, the M2 MacBook Air does offer a MagSafe port (which isn’t found on the cheaper M1-powered MacBook Air) so you can charge your laptop and still have two USB ports free. </p>\n\n<p>You may feel that you need more storage than the entry-level model offers (in which case the MacBook Air will cost a little more). There are benefits to choosing the 512GB version, in fact, we’ve found that Apple’s smaller SSDs aren’t as fast as the larger ones, but the speed of the SSD is likely to only matter if the kind of apps you are using access the SSD frequently, which is unlikely if you are just typing essays or researching on the internet. Rather than fork out for extra storage built-in you may find external storage, or even iCloud storage, works out cheaper. (If you have a big Music library, for example, pay for iTunes Match so you can keep your music in the cloud. If you have a big photo library turn on iCloud Photos and get additional <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672409/how-much-does-icloud-cost.html\">iCloud storage</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Air, M2? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,099 / £1,149 / AU$1,799 / CA$1,449<br />Student: $999 / £1,049 / AU$1,649 / CA$1,299</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £100 / AU$150 / CA$150</em></p>\n\n<p>You’ll see the best prices right now in the block above, which may be even better than Apple’s education pricing. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 13-inch MacBook Air (2022, M2) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

There’s also a bigger screen, obviously. </p>\n\n<p>Another benefit relates to the speakers, which are better than the smaller MacBook Air’s: a six-speaker sound system with force-canceling woofers rather than the four-speaker sound system of the 13-inch M2, and the stereo speakers of the M1 model. </p>\n\n<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air weighs a little more and will take up more space in your bag, but if you want a bigger screen then that’s a fair price to pay. </p>\n\n<p>Battery life is the same 18-hours as the other 13-inch MacBook Air models. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 15-inch MacBook Air, M2? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,299 / £1,399 / AU$2,199 / CA$1,749<br />Student: $1,199 / £1,289 / AU$1,999 / CA$1,599</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £110 / AU$200 / CA$150</em></p>\n\n<p>You’ll see the best prices right now in the block above, which may be even better than Apple’s education pricing. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1945548/15-inch-macbook-air-vs-14-inch-pro.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 15-inch MacBook Air (M2, 256 GB, 2023) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

The range starts from $1,299/£1,349 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and goes up to $3,499/£3,749 for the top-of-the-range 16-inch version (we don’t think you’ll need that model!)</p>\n\n<p>There are two versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro to choose from: one has 256GB of storage while the other has 512GB, but costs an extra £200/$200. There is no other difference between the two models so you need to decide if the extra storage is necessary. If you think you need more storage because of the size of your photo or music library we would suggest that you to iCloud storage solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676965/how-to-save-space-by-moving-photos-from-a-mac-to-icloud.html\">iCloud Photos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671965/best-apple-music-service-itunes-match-vs-apple-music.html\">iTunes Match</a>. If you are likely to use apps that access the SSD frequently then you may benefit from the bigger drive, which in tests has been proven to be faster. </p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of the 13-inch MacBook Pro compared to the MacBook Air is its 20 hours of battery life. This beats the MacBook Air by 2 hours. In fact, it beats the 14-inch MacBook Pro by 3 hours. Older Intel-powered Mac laptops only claimed 10 hours so this is a benefit of the M1 and later Macs.</p>\n\n<p>This entry-level MacBook Pro comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports (which double up as USB 4). You won’t find the older USB-A port on any new Mac laptop. If you want USB-A ports you would have to consider a second-hand Mac laptop, a desktop Mac, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668462/best-usb-c-hubs-and-adapters-for-mac-2022.html\">get an adaptor</a>, or just get rid of your old <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668496/best-mouse-for-macbook-and-mac.html\">mouse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668394/the-best-keyboards-for-mac-2022.html\">keyboard</a> and go wireless.

The 14-inch or 16-inch MacBook Pro offer a wider selection of ports including HDMI, SD card reader, and MagSafe charging in addition to the USB/Thunderbolt ports. </p>\n\n<p>For most, the entry-level MacBook Pro model should be a decent enough spec to get your work done without any issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Pro, M2? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,299 / £1,349 / AU$1,999 / CA$1,699<br />Student: $1,199 / £1,249 / AU$1,849 / CA$1,574</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £150 / AU$150 / CA$125</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/791082/13-inch-macbook-pro-m2-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 13-inch MacBook Pro (M2, 2022) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.

That’s $100/£150 less than the newer M2 MacBook Air ($999/£1,049 for students).</p>\n\n<p>That’s not a huge saving, so, if it’s all you have to spend, we suggest you shop around a bit before you buy: you may find a discount on the M2 13-inch MacBook Air that beats Apple’s Student discount on the older model. </p>\n\n<p>We recommend spending that extra $100 because the M2 MacBook Air is the better purchase. The M1 MacBook Air, which launched in November 2020, will be three years old before the end of 2023, it doesn’t offer the bigger screen or the superior FaceTime camera of the M2 MacBook Air, and the newer M2-chip is superior to the M1 inside this MacBook Air. The M2 model also benefited from a redesign. </p>\n\n<p>That said, the M1 MacBook Air will be more than adequate for a student, especially those predominantly writing essays and conducting research. </p>\n\n<p>If upgrading to the M2 MacBook Air isn’t possible, this will still be a good purchase that will stand you in good stead for a few years. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Air, M1? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $999 / £999 / AU$1,499 / CA$1,299<br />Student: $899 / £899 /AU$1,349 / CA$1,169</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £100 / AU$150 / CA$1</em>3<em>0</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667907/macbook-air-vs-imac.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple MacBook Air (2020) M1 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>MacBook vs Mac desktop for students?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Student life normally involves a fair amount of mobility – traveling to lectures, libraries, the occasional coffee shop, and then possibly home for weekends and term breaks–so it makes sense to consider a laptop rather than a desktop Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the screen sizes in MacBooks are smaller than iMacs, you can always buy a cheap screen and use that with your laptop when you are home. Or, if you also have an iPad, you might be able to link your iPad to your MacBook and use the iPad screen too (here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671945/how-to-use-an-ipad-as-a-second-monitor.html\">how to use your iPad as a second screen for your Mac</a>). You could also use that iPad for taking notes when you are at lectures (read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668914/best-ipad-for-students.html\">best iPad for students</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some benefits to buying a Mac desktop. Generally, it is the case that you pay more for a Mac laptop, compared to the same specs on a desktop. The Mac mini, for example, is Apple’s cheapest Mac despite having some pretty impressive specs. However, if you compare the 24-inch iMac with a similarly speced Mac laptop the iMac is considerably more expensive. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iMac vs Mac mini vs Mac Studio for students</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we appreciate that there are plenty of benefits associated with choosing a laptop for university, you may be better off with a desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

Thanks to its design it’s certainly a Mac that will make a statement to anyone entering your dorm room.</p>\n\n<p>The iMac might be one for consideration for a student–but it’s a non-portable Mac, which might deter many students from purchasing one. You won’t be able to take it with you to lectures–or cart it home on a train for the holidays–but you will be able to work more efficiently thanks to its 24-inch screen.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest problems with the iMac though are its age and its price. This is the April 2021 model so it still features the M1 chip, with every other Mac having been updated now. It’s also got an unfathomably high price, even with the student discount. </p>\n\n<p>We don’t recommend you buy one, at least not until Apple upgrades the specs. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the iMac? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,299 / £1,399 / AU$1,999 / CA$1,699<br />Student discount: $1,249 / £1,349 / AU$1,919 / CA$1,629</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $50 / £210 / AU$330 / CA$270</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667247/best-imac-which-imac-to-buy.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 24-inch iMac (M1, 2021) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Which Mac should you get for university?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3449417/apple_macbook_air_m1_2020_review_65_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Air\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our pick of the entire Mac range, if you’re a student, is the M2 MacBook Air. It will give you a better screen, better webcam and an attractive new design to show off in lectures. It’s light, fast, and with student pricing starting at $999/£999 it’s very good value. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could save by opting for the older M1 MacBook Air, but, if you are looking for the cheapest Mac you can get, the M2 Mac mini is a very good option. It’s powerful and with Apple’s education discount, it’s just $499/£539. You just need a monitor, mouse and keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get a discount on a Mac for university or school</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get a student discount at Apple’s education stores, but you have to qualify as a student in higher education, be a teacher, someone buying for an education institution, or a home educator. School-age children can only take advantage if the equipment is being purchased by their school or if their parent is home-educating them. If you are a registered student you’ll be able to get a discount on a new Mac if you shop in Apple’s various Education Stores (below).

There are various ways to get a bargain:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Look out for reseller discounts</strong>: Another way to get a bargain is to look out for deals at Apple resellers and Amazon, where we have see Macs with as much as $500 off the price. Take a look at our round ups of the best Mac deals to get the best prices right now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673333/best-macbook-air-deals.html\">Best MacBook Air deals this month</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678533/mac-studio-deals.html\">Best Mac Studio deals available now</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">Best MacBook Pro deals this month</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672803/best-imac-deals.html\">Best iMac deals this month</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673695/best-mac-mini-deals.html\">Best Mac mini deals this month</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buy a refurbished Mac</strong>: Take advantage of <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670477-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> where the company sells ex-display, returned, and previous-generation Macs at a discount. The benefit of buying refurbished from Apple is that the products are fully checked and come with a one-year warranty. You can also get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/where-to-buy-a-refurbished-macbook-or-mac.html\">a refurbished Mac</a> elsewhere with many resellers offering the same service, but beware that not all refurbished Macs are equal. Usually refurbished means that the Mac is guaranteed to be in full working order, but do check with the reseller. Here’s a guide to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/where-to-buy-a-refurbished-macbook-or-mac.html\">how to buy a refurbished Mac.</a> We also look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673929/why-you-should-buy-a-refurbished-mac.html\">why you should buy a refurbished Mac.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buy second hand/used</strong>: One advantage of buying refurbished is that it should be guaranteed to work and you should have no problem returning it if there is a problem. These are reasons why we don’t recommend buying <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678277/why-you-shouldnt-buy-a-second-hand-mac.html\">a second hand Mac</a>. If you do see a deal on a second hand or used Mac just be especially cautious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best Mac bargains are usually on older models, although we do see discounts on current Macs as well. If you see a good discount on an older Mac it’s important to be aware of what the newer models offers so that you know what you are missing out on and can judge whether the deal is as good as it appears to be. For one thing, older Macs are likely to feature Intel processors rather than Apple’s M1, M2 or their variants, which could put you at a disadvantage in the future (and will certainly mean your Mac depreciates in value very quickly). If you are picking an Intel Mac then make sure that it is a relatively recent Intel chip to ensure that Apple will at least support that Mac until the end of your course.
