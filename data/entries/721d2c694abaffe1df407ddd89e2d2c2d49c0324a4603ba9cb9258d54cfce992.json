Far from quieting down again, by February of this year, the galaxy had begun emitting X-ray light; it is becoming <em>more</em> active. Astronomers think it is most likely an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus\">active galactic nucleus</a> (AGN), which gets its energy from supermassive black holes at the galaxy's center and/or from the black hole's spin. That's the conclusion of a <a href=\"https://aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347957\">new paper</a> accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, although the authors acknowledge the possibility that it might also be some kind of rare <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/black-hole-belches-out-remnants-of-gobbled-star-years-after-initial-meal/\">tidal disruption event</a> (TDE).</p>\n<p>The brightening of SDSS1335_0728 in the constellation Virgo, after decades of quietude, was first detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility telescope. Its supermassive black hole is estimated to be about 1 million solar masses. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, the authors combed through archival data and combined that with data from new observations from various instruments, including <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/x-shooter/\">the X-shooter</a>, part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope\">Very Large Telescope</a> (VLT) in Chile's Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons why a normally quiet galaxy might suddenly brighten, including supernovae or a TDE, in which part of the shredded star's original mass is ejected violently outward. This, in turn, can form an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk\">accretion disk</a> around the black hole that emits powerful X-rays and visible light. But these events don't last nearly five years—usually not more than a few hundred days.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031926#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031926&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"721d2c694abaffe1df407ddd89e2d2c2d49c0324a4603ba9cb9258d54cfce992","category":"Tech"}
