Only the padding is 3D-printed.</p>\n<p>3D-printed padding is usually deeper and softer for its weight than traditional EPA foam- or gel-based padding.</p>\n<p>Locatelli says 3D-printed saddles are made in a completely different way to traditional saddles.</p>\n<p>Traditional saddles require a mould for the padded section (and the rails), so each time the designers want to change the design, they have to make a new mould.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Grifn bike with road setup\" title=\"Ridley Grifn first ride - 19\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The design of traditional foam- or EPA-based padding is harder to tweak mid-iteration.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On the other hand, the padding for a 3D-printed saddle starts with a digital 3D file of the shape Fizik wants to print.</p>\n<p>Then, its engineers add the internal structure by selecting the cell shapes, densities and zones.</p>\n<p>The digital file is then fed into a 3D printer. The file contains data which tells the printer where to print the material: horizontally, vertically and at what depth.</p>\n<p>A standard printer can only print in vertical and horizontal planes, i.e. in two dimensions.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fizik Argo Adaptive\" title=\"fizik-argo-adaptive-3\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Only the padding is 3D-printed; the rails and hull are made conventionally.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>In this additive manufacturing process, the 3D printer prints layer by layer. This allows the printer to vary the thickness of each layer.</p>\n<p>The padding for 3D-printed saddles typically has a 3-dimensional lattice of hexagon-shaped polymers. This padding is glued onto the base of the saddle ready to be tested.</p>\n<p>The 3D-printed structure can benefit the rider by providing more finely-tuned variable padding density across the saddle, thanks to the lattice structure, while also enabling product designers to work quicker.</p>\n<p>Fizik’s Locatelli says the brand can tweak a 3D-printed saddle design and print a new padding in minutes, allowing Fizik to test several saddle designs a day during the design and prototype phase.</p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of a 3D-printed saddle?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n

Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Provided the saddle fits you properly, which we’ll come on to, Locatelli says: “3D-printed padding can provide more comfort thanks to the mechanical properties of the material used, including better vibration dampening and pressure absorption.”</p>\n<p>Increased comfort makes your riding more enjoyable, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/health/how-to-avoid-and-treat-saddle-sores/\">helps avoid saddle sores</a> and improves performance, according to Locatelli.</p>\n<p>“You’re moving less on the saddle to find the best spot or simply you don’t need to change position to alleviate pressure on soft tissues.</p>\n<p>“It allows a better posture, more weight balance that, in the long run, will generate less fatigue,” he argues.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

saddles during <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/bike-fit-explained-what-is-a-bike-fit-and-should-you-get-one/\">bike fits</a>, he typically sees more even pressure distribution.</p>\n<p>For Smith, this is the key benefit of 3D-printed saddles over traditional foam or gel saddles.</p>\n<p>More pressure distribution over a saddle reduces the likelihood of “hot spots” – localised points of pressure which, because they’re often on bones, are uncomfortable, according to Smith.</p>\n<p>The speed of the 3D-printing process benefits the saddle designers too, according to Locatelli.</p>\n<p>“The iterations are so fast that we can now be more precise in addressing ergonomics, densities and support,” he explains.</p>\n<p>“With traditional industrial methods, each iteration can take weeks while waiting for mould modifications.</p>\n<p>“With 3D-printed padding, we can print multiple iterations each day.”</p>\n<h2>How do 3D-printed saddles work?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Graphic showing how

Specialized claims this graphic shows greater pressure dispersal from the 3D-printed saddle (left).</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"http://Specialized\"><strong>Specialized</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>As we’ve already covered, one of the key advantages of 3D printing technology is the ability to vary padding density with more precision than a traditional saddle.</p>\n<p>Where riders tend to place more pressure, such as the saddle wings where sit bones usually rest, the padding can be denser, says Locatelli.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the padding on the nose of the saddle might be firmer to provide more support when you lean into an aggressive riding position.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

Rossiter / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Locatelli claims Fizik has found that 3D-printed padding reduces peak pressure (the amount of load on the saddle where a rider rests the most weight) by 60 per cent.</p>\n<p>Although he is sceptical about some 3D-printed saddle marketing, Smith says: “The padding is thicker and you have air instead of solid material (whether it’s foam, gel or a combination) underneath you.</p>\n<p>“So it spreads the pressure over a wider area because there’s no firm contact on your pelvis.”</p>\n\n<h2>What are the disadvantages of a 3D-printed

perch isn’t a sure-fire way to solve discomfort.</p>\n<p>“3D-printed padding will not cure your problems,” says Smith.</p>\n<p>“The padding of a saddle is the least important part.</p>\n<p>“The shape – for instance, the width and length – and the presence or absence of a cut-out have more influence on comfort.</p>\n<p>“To load your pelvis the way it wants to be loaded, you need the right shape saddle,” he explains.</p>\n<p>Incorrect pelvic loading lies behind many of the <a

<i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>3D-printed saddles are among the most expensive saddles on the market. This is partly because 3D-printed saddles tend to have pricier carbon rails, and 3D-printing technology is generally more expensive than other larger-scale manufacturing techniques.</p>\n<p>But the technology is slowly trickling down to cheaper models.</p>\n<p>For example, Specialized launched the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-s-works-romin-evo-mirror-saddle/\">3D-printed S-Works Romin EVO with Mirror saddle </a>at £390/$450 in 2021.</p>\n<p>The Californian brand introduced the slightly cheaper <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-pro-power-with-mirror-saddle/\">Power Pro with Mirror saddle</a> in 2022 at £290/$325/€370/AU$500.</p>\n<p>Fizik released its first 3D-printed saddle, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/fizik-antares-versus-evo-00-adaptive-saddle-review/\">Antares Versus Evo 00 Adaptive</a>, in 2020 at £370.</p>\n<p>The latest version (£399.99/$399.99) still tops the Italian brand’s saddle range. However, cheaper 3D-printed saddles are now available, such as the £259.99/$259 Vento Argo R3 Adaptive, although undoubtedly this is still an expensive option.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Selle Italia Novus Boost Evo 3D Kit Carbonio Superflow saddle\" title=\"12-33-17BikeRadar_150823_kg0110\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 3D-printed padding adds to the cost of the standard Selle Italia Novus Boost Evo Carbonio Superflow.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Selle Italia is another key 3D-printed saddle manufacturer and its models are similarly premium.</p>\n<p>For example, the Selle Italia Novus Boost Evo 3D Kit Carbonio Superflow costs £399.99/$449.90.
