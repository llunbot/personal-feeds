In addition, on Apple's product pages for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, the devices are only shown with a mmWave antenna window on the company's U.S. website, with no mmWave antenna window shown in any other countries.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/iphone-13-mmwave-more-countries-kuo/\">had predicted</a> that iPhone 13 models supporting mmWave 5G would be available in additional markets, such as Canada, Japan, Australia, and select European countries. Taiwanese research firm TrendForce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/iphone-13-release-date-and-features/\">had also expected</a> iPhones with mmWave 5G to be available in more countries, citing its own investigations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nmmWave is a set of 5G frequencies that promise ultra-fast speeds at short distances, making it best suited for dense urban areas. By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas. All four iPhone 13 models support sub-6GHz outside of the United States, and sub-6GHz networks are more common in countries that have rolled out 5G.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niPhone 13 models do support additional 5G bands overall, according to Apple, resulting in the devices having greater 5G coverage around the world.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll four iPhone 13 models will be available to pre-order starting this Friday, September 17 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time in over 30 countries and regions, and all of the devices will launch one week later on Friday, September 24.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mmwave/\">mmWave</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-mmwave-5g-remains-us-only/\">mmWave 5G on iPhone 13 Remains Limited to U.S. Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mmwave-5g-on-iphone-13-remains-limited-to-u-s-models.2310891/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V0XzeQvE5Lo:DRXKOrLzqQE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V0XzeQvE5Lo:DRXKOrLzqQE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/V0XzeQvE5Lo\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e8f64bd85bd417e60d3ff4d510bd950d1e6f9ba453d3846b250582423a7208a1","category":"Apple"}
