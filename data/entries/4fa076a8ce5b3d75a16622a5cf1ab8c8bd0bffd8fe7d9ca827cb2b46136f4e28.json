Everyone grows as a person, I just did it in an unconventional way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Spending so much time by yourself and being so reliant on yourself and needing to trust yourself in whatever decision you make and whatever problem you solve and however you do it, it’s just made me feel like me.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The scenic route</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-3-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Boru McCullagh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as an eight-month plan soon digressed and McCullagh took a much more free-spirited approach to his adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His route went through Europe over the Alps to Turkey, then across India, and through Southeast Asia to Indonesia. He then flew to Australia and crossed the continent, taking on the infamous Nullabor plain, before another epic country crossing of the USA, riding from San Francisco to New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final leg started in Morocco, heading north through Spain and France and then across Ireland before hopping on the ferry to Holyhead in Wales for the last stint back to Herne Hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The trip definitely evolved into something else,’ he says. ‘I was very naive when I left, thinking I had to do a certain number of kilometres a day, and I had grand ideas about something I thought I knew about, but really I knew nothing about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I started with tunnel vision focussing on what I expected would happen, but I got rid of that and I ended up prolonging the trip by just over a year and a half from what I thought it would be.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-6-1140x641.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Boru McCullagh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite regular digressions from his route, the decision to head back home came in Utah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was riding in southern Utah in America, one of the most beautiful places in the world, and I just had this morning when I was riding amongst the red mountains and I broke down on the side of the road and had a little cry,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I felt that I’d seen it all now, and although I didn’t know what I was trying to find through the trip, after that morning I found that. I felt happy that I could go home and feel accomplished and be proud of what I had done.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A homecoming ride was organised for the final day from Windsor to Herne Hill to welcome his return back to where it all began at the velodrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My sunglasses stayed firmly in front of my eyes because I was feeling so much,’ he says. ‘I was chatting to everyone around me as if it was completely fine and normal, but part of me just wanted to stop and just have a little moment to myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was surreal but also surreally normal at the same time. I’ve been going to Herne Hill Velodrome since I was ten years old multiple times a week and I know the place so well.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+6\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'escape to your favourite place every month', click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-6-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Home and away</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/boru-mccullagh-2025-2-1140x641.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Boru McCullagh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Covering over 55,000km takes a long time, and McCullagh has no end of highlights from his trip and the 31 countries he visited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Taiwan has the best tarmac roads as you can just go anywhere,’ he says. ‘For a country that’s so small as the crow flies, it’s so mountainous, and there are high mountains as well so you can get a good range of riding there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I also spent quite a lot of time in Indonesia, the bikepacking and ultracycling community out there is insane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was also so fun to cycle across India, because there’s no infrastructure for cycling and that’s what makes it so fun. There’s organised chaos happening around you, which is stimulating and engaging because you can’t switch off at all.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey from Wales to Windsor also opened his eyes to the beautiful riding the UK has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Riding through Wales and the UK, I felt this overwhelming sense of oneness that I felt I was part of this painting of the UK countryside and that was like a really special moment for me,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve never seen the UK countryside in that way; we really do live in a beautiful place. Beforehand I thought it’s just the lanes, you don’t see any uniqueness or appreciate how special it is. My eyes have just never been open to that sort of thing before.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

as McCullagh’s travels progressed: talking to strangers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having grown up in Eltham, southeast London, the typical Londoner mentality of not engaging with others was a sticking point at first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In London everyone’s doing their own thing, they’ve got their closest people around them but it doesn’t stretch further than that, and that showed itself to me,’ he says. ‘When I first left if I had a problem I’d be on Google straight away rather than asking people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was uncomfortable with the thought of walking up to someone and asking them about the best roads, and then I realised that local people know their area best, so I should just ask them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People were so friendly, which gave me some confidence and the reassurance that every place isn’t like London, most people in the world <em>do</em> want to chat to you.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\"

Australia because it is huge and there’s not many people there,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Beforehand I was trying to hype myself up and be OK being really lonely out there but it’s the opposite.
