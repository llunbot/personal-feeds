The plan, which includes a section titled \"Make America First in AI,\" signals a dramatic potential shift in AI policy if Trump returns to the White House in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The draft order, obtained by the Post, outlines a series of \"Manhattan Projects\" to advance military AI capabilities. It calls for an immediate review of what it terms \"unnecessary and burdensome regulations\" on AI development. The approach marks a contrast to the Biden administration's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/biden-ai-executive-order-requires-safety-testing-for-ai-that-poses-serious-risk/\">executive order from last October</a>, which imposed new safety testing requirements on advanced AI systems.</p>\n<p>The proposed order suggests creating \"industry-led\" agencies to evaluate AI models and safeguard systems from foreign threats. This approach would likely benefit tech companies already collaborating with the Pentagon on AI projects, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies\">Palantir</a>, <a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/\">Anduril</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_AI\">Scale AI</a>. Executives from these firms have reportedly expressed support for Trump.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037557#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037557&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85f640a180e4131426154eb99c769663209d0adcfc114f96f454f071e2fabdf8","category":"Tech"}
