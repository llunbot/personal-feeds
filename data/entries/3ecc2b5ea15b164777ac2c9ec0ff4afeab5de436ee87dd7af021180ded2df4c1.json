I had been walking by it for a few days, looking at it uninterested, thinking it was just <em>another</em> “hang your bike on a hook” storage system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it’s not.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-bikes-squeezed-in-tight-e1682445899123.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"932\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-bikes-squeezed-in-tight-e1682445899123-800x932.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed Sliding Bike Storage bikes squeezed in tight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-bikes-squeezed-in-tight-e1682445899123-800x932.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-bikes-squeezed-in-tight-e1682445899123-258x300.jpeg 258w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-bikes-squeezed-in-tight-e1682445899123-103x120.jpeg 103w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-bikes-squeezed-in-tight-e1682445899123-768x894.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-bikes-squeezed-in-tight-e1682445899123.jpeg 838w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

Plus, it’s versatile and flexible in its mounting options. It can be used on a wall or hanging from the ceiling (flat or angled), or you’ll eventually be able to purchase a freestanding support rack like the one shown above. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Stashed freestanding rack prototype\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Spacerail-prototype-freestanding-rack-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This prototype was originally built just for the show, but due to consumer demand, Elliot says they’re going into production.

Their hooks aren’t just any ol’ hook. They have an ingenious mechanism that allows the hooks to not only Auto Lock when unweighted but roll with ease once the bike is loaded. They fully rotate as well, allowing for angular bike “stacking”. The hooks come equipped with a built-in little side hook on them as well to store your helmet or what have you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed Sliding Bike Storage kids and fat bike adaptor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-kids-and-fat-bike-adaptor.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They have some neat accessories for the storage of kids’ bikes and fat tire bikes. There is the <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/collections/accessories/products/double-hook\" target=\"_blank\">Double Hook</a> (above photo in green) that allows you to hang a kid’s bike from the back wheel of another kid’s bike… and voilà, two small bikes in the space of one larger one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strap attached to the blue fitting (above photo, under the green hook) is their <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/products/fat-tyre-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">Fat Tire Adaptor</a>. This simple wraps around the fat tire bike’s front wheel/tire leaving the blue fitting to attach to the racks hook, providing a simple solution for fat bike storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed Sliding Bike Storage pedal cover frame protector\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-pedal-cover-frame-protector.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another neat accessory is their Pedal Wrap. This simply wraps your pedal with a Velcro closure so you can slide your bikes snuggly close without causing frame damage by a neighboring pedal. The Pedal Wrap comes in small, medium, and large for a neat and simple solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed Sliding Bike Storage close together\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stashed-Sliding-Bike-Storage-close-together.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stashed SpaceRail Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One complete storage kit comes with a single SpaceRail (1200mm/4ft) that can hold a total of 120kg (30kg/65lbs) per hook.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>One SpaceRail storage system <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/products/bike-storage-ceiling-mounted-kit\" target=\"_blank\">for the ceiling</a>: $203 (includes rail, 1 hook, and mounting hardware)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One SpaceRail storage system <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/products/copy-of-spacerail-bike-storage-system-wall\" target=\"_blank\">for the wall</a>: $394 (includes rail, 1 hook, and wall mounting hardware)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One SpaceRail storage system <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/products/copy-of-spacerail-bike-storage-system-a\" target=\"_blank\">for angle</a>: $254 (includes rail, 1 hook, and mounting hardware)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional Spacerail Bike Hook: $77 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Freestanding Rack: TBD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out all the storage options Stashed has to offer by clicking below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">StashedProducts.co.uk</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stashed-spacerail-bike-storage-freestanding-prototype/\">Stashed SpaceRail Bike Storage Gets a Freestanding Prototype</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3ecc2b5ea15b164777ac2c9ec0ff4afeab5de436ee87dd7af021180ded2df4c1","category":"Cycling"}
