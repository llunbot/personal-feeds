These new tires will feature the Conti’s Enduro Casing in the highly-anticipated SuperSoft compounds, a first for the brand. That means maximum grip for those aggressive riders who love riding technical and challenging terrain without the weight of a DH tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic.webp\" alt=\"Continental Gravity Extension first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-first-pic-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Continental)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When they introduced the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/continental-kryptotal-reveiw/\" target=\"_blank\">SuperSoft compound</a> back in 2022, it marked an evolution in Conti’s tire tech. The compound is engineered to provide exceptional traction and control, with a super-grippy rubber. In turn, enhancing traction on technical descents, wet roots, and loose surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing.webp\" alt=\"Continental Gravity Extension casing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-casing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When Conti blended the SuperSoft compound with their Enduro casing, their hopes were to increase cornering and braking confidence without increasing tire weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From the Horse’s Mouth</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run.webp\" alt=\"Continental Gravity Extension Forest run\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Forest-run-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexander Haenke<strong>, </strong>Conti’s MTB Product Manager had this to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Since launching the Gravity range, it’s been really exciting to see how riders have been mixing and matching different combinations of tires from the portfolio. We received many messages on social media and at events specifically asking us to extend our range to include softer compound options in lighter casings. Well, you asked, and we listened. We’re excited to introduce the SuperSoft compound in our Enduro casing, as well as adding more sizes and variants to the range. Now riders have even more flexibility for optimizing their setup.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Tire Sizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall.webp\" alt=\"Continental Gravity Extension side wall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-side-wall-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continental’s Kryptotal tire now comes in 20, 24, and 26-inch sizes, which is great news for riders who love smaller wheels for their agility, or kids bikes, or trials bikes, but still want grippy tires. They’ve also added more options for 29er and 27.5-inch wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal.webp\" alt=\"Continental Gravity Extension Argotal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-Argotal-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders can choose the Enduro casings with SuperSoft compound if they’re after maximum grip.  Or, they can opt for the Soft compound in Trail casing for better support and durability. Gravity riders can mix and match casings and compounds to dial in exactly what works for their riding style.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering.webp\" alt=\"Continental Gravity Extension cornering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Continental-Gravity-Extension-cornering-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the link below to find your size! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.continental-tires.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Continental-Tires.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/continental-gravity-tires-enduro-casing-supersoft-compound-20-24-26-27-29/\">New Continental Gravity Tires Blend Enduro Casings with SuperSoft Compound + New Sizes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"2c83cc01944c47d779eb59b70a02bd9da5d3f66c53cd64a4d6b23bb7c9880dd1","category":"Cycling"}
