When attached to an ‌iPhone‌ that was charging via Lightning, the ‌iPhone‌ could deliver power to the MagSafe Battery Pack, which was the first instance of an ‌iPhone‌ being able to route power to an accessory device. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/\">discontinued</a> the MagSafe Battery Pack in September 2023 with the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup, which dropped the Lightning cable in favor of USB-C. iPhone 15 and later models can reverse charge Apple Watch, AirPods, and other smaller devices that support Power Delivery at up to 4.5 watts via the USB-C port, but the wireless reverse charging feature for Apple devices has not been implemented since the discontinuation of the MagSafe Battery Pack.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2022, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">predicted</a> that a relaunched MagSafe Battery Pack would eventually transition to USB-C, but that has yet to happen. Likewise, In September 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman also said he <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/will-there-be-a-usb-c-magsafe-battery-pack/\">expected</a> USB-C versions of the MagSafe Battery Pack to return \"eventually.\" But he qualified that by saying \"Don't hold your breath.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital today admitted that while Apple is testing the reverse wireless charging feature for the iPhone 17 Pro models, the leaker does not know if the feature will actually be enabled on the devices when they officially launch. Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup around mid-September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">Instant Digital</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-17-pro-reverse-charging-feature/\">iPhone 17 Pro: Apple Has 'Tested' Wireless Reverse Charging Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-apple-has-tested-wireless-reverse-charging-feature.2449682/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"05e7ad241da4dc9f98ff174cefb31c15ebf3c02ddc364dca62693cc2aa0d6e28","category":"Apple"}
