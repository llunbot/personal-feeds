Combine all of that with wireless SRAM gears and you begin to get an idea of what sort of bike this is.</p>\n<p>Overall, this Topstone is one of the most capable gravel bikes BikeRadar has ever tested.

And yes, the £5,600 price tag is only for the frameset.</p>\n<p>Riding the Routt 45 with SRAM Force eTap AXS, a Chris King headset and an Enve bar, this bike was everything you’d hope a titanium gravel bike of this level would be, proving super-smooth to ride on- and off-road with plenty of stiffness when pedalling.</p>\n<p>The price puts it in the territory of the very best carbon road bikes, and while the Moots is light, it is not the lightest.

Since these bicycles are designed to traverse miles of unpaved roads, their tyres are substantially larger. Likewise, mud clearance is also a concern in these conditions.</p>\n<p>Tyre widths range anywhere from 30mm to 48mm. In addition to 700c wheels, it is also common to see smaller diameter 650b wheels used with higher volume tyres.</p>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">best gravel bike tyres</a> feature a fast-rolling centre tread with knurling or side knobs to improve cornering ability on mixed surfaces.</p>\n<p>Tubeless tyres are also commonly found on gravel bikes because the latex <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">sealant</a> provides a degree of insurance against punctures.</p>\n<p>In addition to wider tyres, gravel bikes have geometry that favours stability and comfort.</p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Given the terrain gravel bikes are expected to cover, frame geometry often rests somewhere between road and cross-country mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Tranker</i></span></div>\n<p>The wheelbase of a gravel bike is longer than most road bikes thanks to longer chainstays and slacker head-tube angles.</p>\n<p>Head tubes are generally taller as well, placing the rider in a more relaxed, upright position. Bottom brackets are often lower, which gives the rider the sensation of riding in, rather than on the bicycle.</p>\n<p>The end result of these geometry differences is a more comfortable, confidence-inspiring and forgiving ride than you would find in a typical road bike.</p>\n<h3>Gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wide range 1x drivetrains are common for gravel grinding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Josh Patterson / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Gearing is another area where these bikes diverge from the pack. Given the terrain, many gravel bikes feature compact or smaller gearing and wide-range cassettes.</p>\n<p>Cranksets with 50/34 or 48/32t are common. Likewise, many gravel bikes come with 1x gearing and wide-range cassettes.</p>\n<h3>Suspension</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A growing number of gravel bikes feature suspension systems, such as this Lauf Grit suspension fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Arnold Bjornsson</i></span></div>\n<p>In addition to wide tyres, relaxed geometry and low gearing, many gravel bikes have active or passive suspension systems built into them.</p>\n<p>Much like bikes in the endurance road category, these features could take the form of slender chainstays, a bowed top tube, or a skinny seatpost, all of which are designed to flex in order to absorb road chatter.</p>\n<p>Some gravel bikes take things one step further by using short-travel suspension forks such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cannondale-lefty-oliver-road-bike-fork-confirmed/\">Lefty Oliver</a> or aesthetically odd but very effective <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/lauf-grit-fork-review/\">Lauf Grit fork</a>.</p>\n<h3>How much do I have to spend on a gravel bike?</h3>\n<p>Well, that depends on what you define as a gravel bike. A used cyclocross bike, for example, could work perfectly well as a gravel bike and cost you a fraction of the cost of even the most basic ‘true’ gravel machine.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking at a purpose-built gravel / all-road bike, expect to pay around £800 / $1,200 for an alloy frame with entry-level components.</p>\n<p>A mid-range build from a major brand will likely cost in excess of £2,000 / $2,800 but should feature a carbon frame and hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n<p>As is normally the case in the cycling world, it’s possible to spend a small (or not so small) fortune on a custom-built bike should you wish.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"5f08183b1201a223e216816cde09c6fb5f6d244a21868b602919d1590239dc99","category":"Cycling"}
