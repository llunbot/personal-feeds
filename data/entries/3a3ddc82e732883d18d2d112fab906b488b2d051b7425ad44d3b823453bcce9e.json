{"title":"Everything New With CarPlay in iOS 17","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-carplay/","date":1687374401000,"content":"Apple is introducing new functionality for almost every <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> app and feature with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> hasn't been left out. We haven't seen the total overhaul of ‌CarPlay‌ that Apple promised last year as of yet, but there are a handful of new features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\n<h2>SharePlay for the Music App</h2>\r<br />\nSharePlay works with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> app in ‌CarPlay‌, which means everyone in the car, passengers included, can contribute to an ‌Apple Music‌ playlist.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/shareplay-carplay.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAs long as the car owner has an ‌Apple Music‌ subscription and initiates a SharePlay session from ‌CarPlay‌, other people in the car can choose music to play. Each person can scan a QR code generated by the main user to get access to the playlist to add songs to the in-car ‌Apple Music‌ queue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnly the person who starts the SharePlay session has to have an ‌Apple Music‌ subscription. Everyone else can use ‌Apple Music‌ to contribute without having to pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>EV Charging Station Improvements</h2>\r<br />\nIf you have an electric vehicle, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a> app can provide real-time charging availability for the charging networks that are compatible with your car. The update should make it easier for EV owners to locate nearby charging stations on a trip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Messages Updates</h2>\r<br />\nThe Messages app in ‌CarPlay‌ has a revamped interface that makes it easier to quickly reply and re-read a message without taking too much attention away from the road.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wallpaper</h2>\r<br />\n‌iOS 17‌ includes new wallpaper options, which can be expanded to the ‌CarPlay‌ interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>The All-New CarPlay Experience</h2>\r<br />\nApple at WWDC 2022 previewed the next-generation version of ‌CarPlay‌, which will offer deeper integration with vehicles in the future. Apple did not talk about the new ‌CarPlay‌ experience at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a>, but the company did say in 2022 that the first cars with the updated technology will be coming in late 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Multi-Display-CarPlay-2.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"896\" />\r<br />\n‌CarPlay‌ will support multiple displays, showing up across all of the displays in a vehicle, including the instrument cluster. Apple will be able to offer a consistent experience throughout the car, and ‌CarPlay‌ will integrate with the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/next-generation-carplay-multi-display.jpg\" alt width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe vehicle's climate controls will also be accessible through ‌CarPlay‌ in upcoming vehicles, letting users adjust temperature and activate other in-car climate features through the ‌CarPlay‌ interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the revamped ‌CarPlay‌ experience slated for a 2023 launch, we can likely expect to see additional ‌CarPlay‌ features coming in future ‌iOS 17‌ updates. Car brands that will support next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ include Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, and Volvo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nMore information on all of the new features in the ‌iOS 17‌ update can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">found in our iOS 17 roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-carplay/\">Everything New With CarPlay in iOS 17</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-new-with-carplay-in-ios-17.2393755/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a3ddc82e732883d18d2d112fab906b488b2d051b7425ad44d3b823453bcce9e","category":"Apple"}
