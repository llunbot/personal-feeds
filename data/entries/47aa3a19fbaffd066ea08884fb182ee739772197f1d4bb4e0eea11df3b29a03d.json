We’ve\ncreated a distraction-free app focused on one thing — your\nphotos. […] All the social network features you’d expect with\nnone of the dark patterns driving engagement. Build relationships\nwith and learn from other photographers while enjoying a\nchronological feed and no public counts. […]</p>\n\n<p>Glass is subscription-based, which means we won’t sell your data\nor pollute your feed with ads. We don’t answer to outside\ninvestors or advertisers, just members of our community.</p>\n\n<p>$4.99 monthly or <s>$49.99 yearly</s> $29.99 yearly (at launch)\nkeeps Glass rolling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it just like OG Instagram? No. Glass is doing its own thing in a bunch of subtle ways. But it’s certainly a lot more like Instagram circa 2010 than Instagram is today. In spirit, it feels a lot like the early days of Flickr. I’ve been beta testing Glass for a few months and it’s an absolutely lovely, exquisitely-designed app. It’s downright serene scrolling through my Glass timeline, something that I haven’t been able to say about Instagram in many years.</p>\n\n<p>Currently iOS only — in fact, I believe the only way to sign in is through Sign In With Apple. There’s a wait list to get in now that they’re out of beta; if Glass intrigues you, I encourage you to sign up now.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/13/glass\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"47aa3a19fbaffd066ea08884fb182ee739772197f1d4bb4e0eea11df3b29a03d","category":"Tech"}
