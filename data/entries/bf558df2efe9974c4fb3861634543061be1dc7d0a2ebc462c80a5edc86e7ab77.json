This versatile mountain bike rack can carry fat bikes too–tire trays are wide enough for 5″ tires. The front wheel rests in zero-frame contact trays and has ratchet straps for tires.</p>\n<p>To lower the rack, simply pull the yellow cam-lever, and then lower it or lift it back into place easily, even with bikes loaded, thanks to the integrated easy-assist gas shock. Enhanced security is offered with a threaded locking hitch pin, and two secure anchor points for use with 3rd party lock-and-chain systems.</p>\n<p>Customize the fit of the rack on your vehicle with the two-position drawbar, and for larger groups, purchase the Add-On to maximize capacity to 6 bikes total.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zero frame contact vertical bike rack</li>\n<li>Fits 2” Class 3 or higher receivers</li>\n<li>Multiple anchor points for securing your bikes to the rack</li>\n<li>Fat Tire compatible, up to 5” wide tires</li>\n<li>Carries up to 60lb per bike</li>\n<li>Works with most mountain bike tires from 1.9″-5″ wide*</li>\n<li>Works with wheel sizes from 26″-29″</li>\n<li>Integrated gas shock helps straighten bike rack after loading bikes in tilted position</li>\n<li>Comes equipped with a locking threaded hitch pin that secures the rack to your vehicle and an integrated vertical anti-wobble pin to remove all wobble from the rack</li>\n<li>Expandable to carry up to 6 bikes with 2 bike Add-On kit **</li>\n<li>Stay-Saver attaches to pedal spindle to prevent pedal-chain stay contact during transit</li>\n<li>Telescoping vertical mast for smaller storage size</li>\n<li>Cam Level actuated tilting mechanism for easier loading of bikes</li>\n<li>Two mounting positions on draw-bar for customizable fit to your vehicle</li>\n<li>Built-in Bottle opener for apres drinks</li>\n<li>Rack Weight: 70.4 lb</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.swagman.ca/products/summit\" target=\"_blank\">Swagman</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/swagman-summit-vertical-bike-rack/\">The Swagman Summit Vertical Bike Rack</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"bf558df2efe9974c4fb3861634543061be1dc7d0a2ebc462c80a5edc86e7ab77","category":"Cycling"}
