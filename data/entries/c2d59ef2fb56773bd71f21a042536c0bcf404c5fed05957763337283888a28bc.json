Apple is aiming to have the chips ready \"by around 2027,\" and if the chips are available early enough in the year, we could see a launch that same year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple wants to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/\">incorporate infrared cameras</a> into the AirPods to provide an enhanced spatial audio experience with the Vision Pro and future devices, plus cameras could also potentially support in-air gesture control, identifying hand movements. Gurman has suggested that Apple is considering cameras that would \"feed data to AI.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the Apple Watch, a future model could incorporate a camera in the screen area, while an upcoming version of the Apple Watch Ultra could have a camera near the Digital Crown. The cameras would enable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/\">Visual Intelligence</a> features to allow users to get information about their surroundings and more tailored directions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe cameras destined for the Apple Watch and AirPods won't likely be used for things like capturing photos or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, but would instead provide visual data for on-device AI features.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/08/apple-camera-equipped-airpods-2027/\">Apple's Camera Equipped AirPods and Apple Watch Could Launch as Soon as 2027</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-camera-equipped-airpods-and-apple-watch-could-launch-as-soon-as-2027.2456736/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c2d59ef2fb56773bd71f21a042536c0bcf404c5fed05957763337283888a28bc","category":"Apple"}
