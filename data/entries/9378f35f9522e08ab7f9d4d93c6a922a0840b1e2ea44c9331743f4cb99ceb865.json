All of the software updates coming this year will be numbered \"26,\" reflecting the September 2025 to September 2026 release cycle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe visionOS-inspired design coming to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS will also extend to tvOS. While tvOS typically receives less attention and specific details are scarce, we can infer some changes based on iOS rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 26 is expected to feature a visionOS-like interface with translucent elements, floating menus and windows, and softer, rounded visuals. The design uses light and shadow to create a glass-like effect, as seen in Apple's WWDC promotional imagery, so expect these to appear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe're also expecting new screensavers, a new cross-platform Games app, Wi-Fi syncing, and potential new AI-powered features.
