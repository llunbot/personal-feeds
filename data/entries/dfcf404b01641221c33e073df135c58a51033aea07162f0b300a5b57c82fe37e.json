When activated through the Clock app, the Stopwatch will now show up both in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> and on the Lock Screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stopwatch.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌Dynamic Island‌ shows a small to-the-second timer, and the Lock Screen shows the full Stopwatch timer when the screen is being looked at. Pressing into the ‌Dynamic Island‌ shows options for pausing the Stopwatch or starting a new lap, with these controls also on the Lock Screen. After the Stopwatch is paused, swiping on it from the Lock Screen or tapping on the \"X\" in ‌Dynamic Island‌ will clear it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTimers have worked with Live Activities since the feature launched with iOS 16, but the Stopwatch could only be viewed in the Clock app. The addition of Live Activities support will prevent users from activating the timer and then forgetting about it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hiddecollee7?lang=en\">Thanks, Hidde</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/ios-17-4-stopwatch-live-activity/\">iOS 17.4 Beta Adds Stopwatch Live Activity</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-beta-adds-stopwatch-live-activity.2417796/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dfcf404b01641221c33e073df135c58a51033aea07162f0b300a5b57c82fe37e","category":"Apple"}
