Apple \"did not comply with the warning,\" according to a <a href=\"https://fas.gov.ru/news/31574\">press release</a> from the agency, and therefore a case has been opened against Apple on the grounds of violating antitrust laws.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"If Apple is found to be in violation of the Competition Law, it could face a turnover penalty on the amount of market revenue,\" the agency added. FAS stopped short of specifying how much a fine would be or under what timeframe. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is no stranger to being scrutinized in Russia and by the FAS. This past April, the Cupertino tech giant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2antimonopolyle-russia-anti-monopoly-fine-app-store/\">was fined $12 million for violating anti-monopoly rules</a> with the ‌App Store‌. Just a month earlier, Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/apple-to-offer-government-approved-apps-russia/\">agreed to comply</a> with the Russian government's request that users be shown government-approved apps <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-setup-russia-government-approved-apps/\">to download during initial device setup</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has already announced steps it plans to take early next year to ease ‌App Store‌ restrictions. As part of a deal to close an investigation in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-reader-app-changes-japan-ftc/\">Apple announced in September</a> that it would allow \"reader\" apps to link to external websites in their apps. These links to external websites can help users set up or manage an account.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/russia/\">Russia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/russia-investigation-app-store-behavior/\">Apple Facing Russian Investigation Into Alleged Monopolistic App Store Behavior</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-facing-russian-investigation-into-alleged-monopolistic-app-store-behavior.2319834/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DMz9HgjVrDU:HNmGq97Jye4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DMz9HgjVrDU:HNmGq97Jye4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DMz9HgjVrDU\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"77dae4aca869b0f9b6ba8ac6b82c900038d110ead71b2a97f9857e92c0624d29","category":"Apple"}
