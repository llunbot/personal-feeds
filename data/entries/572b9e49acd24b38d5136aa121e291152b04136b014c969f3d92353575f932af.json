A proper task chair, for example, can prevent abnormal strain on the neuromuscular system, according to a 2012 research paper published by the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552974/\">National Institutes of Health</a>. Better posture support, reduced back and neck pain, and improved circulation are among some of the benefits as the chair helps keep the spine, neck, and hips aligned. Chairs with a headrest also add support for the back and shoulders, according to <a href=\"https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/the-benefits-of-ergonomic-furniture/53340/\">Open Access Government</a>.</p>\n<p>If you're shopping for an office chair and don't want to spend a ton of money on bigger brands like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/we-test-herman-millers-1499-gaming-chair-all-business-to-a-fault/\">Herman Miller</a>, there are plenty of affordable options that are on sale today.
