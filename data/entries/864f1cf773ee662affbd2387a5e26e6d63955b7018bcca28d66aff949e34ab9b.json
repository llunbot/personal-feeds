The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> Mount lets you use your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as a camera for your ‌Apple TV‌ on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nApple actually showed off this mount when it introduced ‌FaceTime‌ on ‌Apple TV‌, but it hasn't been available for purchase until now, and there hasn't been an official solution for mounting an ‌iPhone‌ to a television set.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HR1V2ZM/A/belkin-iphone-mount-with-magsafe-for-apple-tv-4k\">Priced at $49.95</a>, the Belkin ‌iPhone‌ Mount has a bracket that is able to attach to a TV or a display that's up to four inches thick, or it can be used with a pedestal as a standalone mount next to a TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's super simple to use the mount, and you just need to pop it on the TV and then stick your MagSafe-enabled ‌iPhone‌ to the mount. You can adjust the tilt from -20 to +30 degrees for the perfect filming angle, and it works in either portrait or landscape mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe tested the mount with ‌FaceTime‌, but it is also compatible with any Continuity Camera-supported apps. The ‌iPhone‌ activates automatically as the camera in ‌FaceTime‌ or another supported app, and all you need to do is be signed in with the same <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> on both devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that using an ‌iPhone‌ as a camera for an ‌Apple TV‌ requires the second-generation ‌Apple TV‌ 4K or later with tvOS 17, and an ‌iPhone‌ (or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>) running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> or later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing a TV for ‌FaceTime‌ is great if you're FaceTiming with multiple people or for SharePlay sessions, and there are options to set up a split-screen layout when using ‌FaceTime‌. The mount and the Continuity Camera feature work with Center Stage, and reactions like fireworks are supported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLarge-screen ‌FaceTime‌ is definitely an experience that's worth trying out if you tend to do a lot of video calling. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HR1V2ZM/A/belkin-iphone-mount-with-magsafe-for-apple-tv-4k\"> Apple is selling the Belkin Mount</a> for $49.95, and it's shipping out almost immediately.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/\">Belkin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/facetime-apple-tv-belkin-magsafe-iphone-mount/\">Testing FaceTime on Apple TV With Belkin's New MagSafe iPhone Mount</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-facetime-on-apple-tv-with-belkins-new-magsafe-iphone-mount.2421225/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"864f1cf773ee662affbd2387a5e26e6d63955b7018bcca28d66aff949e34ab9b","category":"Apple"}
