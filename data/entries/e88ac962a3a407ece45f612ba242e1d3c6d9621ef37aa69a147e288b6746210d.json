Except there’s not a pool, and instead you’re breathing through a snorkel while white-knuckling a rickity old bike down sketchy trails. The snorkel turns into a mouth guard and your water wings provide a false sense of security, all while your face mask fogs up like a haunted house. Welcome to the Slender James Classic Enduro of 2022.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\"

deified cat continues to reveal themselves in wild and wonderful (and wet) ways. And really, what choice did we have but to follow their lead? To be a disciple of Slender James requires laying that which is “proper” and “sensical” aside in favor of a series of “why not?” and “sure, let’s ride bikes in speedo’s with a towel cape and ‘accidentally’ hit some jumps.” I have a theory that the bonds that are formed through shared experiences strengthen in direct correlation with the level of absurdity of said shared experiences.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?w=2048&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/SJ22-46.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Not everyone, after all, is willing to spend a perfectly good summer Saturday wrapped in a Franklin the Turtle towel trying to keep from going “end over tea kettle” over their 540mm handlebars.
