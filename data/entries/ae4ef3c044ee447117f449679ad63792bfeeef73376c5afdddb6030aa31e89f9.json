Sentry is running a hands-on workshop: “<a href=\"https://sentry.io/resources/ios-workshop-jan-2026/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=paid-display&amp;utm_campaign=general-fy27q1-evergreen&amp;utm_content=static-ad-mobilerss-trysentry\">Crash Reporting, Tracing, and Logs for iOS in Sentry</a>”. You can watch it on demand. You’ll learn how to connect the dots between slowdowns, crashes, and the user experience in your iOS app. It’ll show you how to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set up Sentry to surface high-priority mobile issues without alert fatigue.</li>\n<li>Use Logs and Breadcrumbs to reconstruct what happened with a crash.</li>\n<li>Find what’s behind a performance bottleneck using Tracing.</li>\n<li>Monitor and reduce the size of your iOS app using Size Analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/22/sentry\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ae4ef3c044ee447117f449679ad63792bfeeef73376c5afdddb6030aa31e89f9","category":"Tech"}
