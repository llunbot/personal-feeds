You might think because these are so specific, like a 29W or 140W charger, that you must use exactly that wattage adapter for a given device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, that’s not the case. While true before the widespread adoption of the USB-C plug type by Apple and everybody else, USB-C makes it even easier as there’s only a single kind of jack you can plug into any port. Power management is a fundamental part of USB generally; USB-C improved on it by allowing for power to flow either direction on a cable (and by adopting the most advanced parts of the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd&amp;xcust=1-1-2200902-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">USB trade group’s power delivery specification</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different host devices (like iPhones and MacBooks) and adapters have specific combinations of power they can offer. But in all cases, any USB-C adapter can provide power to any host device with a USB-C port. You can’t go wrong: no adapter will provide more power than a host can accept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you plug a 10W adapter into a MacBook Pro that can charge up to 140W, it only passes power at 10W. Likewise, a 140W adapter won’t blow up a maximum 29W chargeable device! In many cases, you can use a relatively low-wattage adapter with a laptop and keep the battery from depleting or charge it slightly. You need to match full wattage to full wattage or higher to ensure a device charges completely, even while in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have recommendations for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html\">best USB-C charger for your MacBook Pro or Air</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2051607/usb-c-charging-cables-iphone-ipad-mac.html\">Best USB-C charging cables for iPhone, iPad and Mac</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Buddy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
