{"title":"iOS 18.2: What You Can Do With Visual Intelligence","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/","date":1734135085000,"content":"Visual Intelligence is an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> feature that's exclusive to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models because it relies on the Camera Control button. Visual Intelligence is available as of iOS 18.2, and this guide outlines what it can do.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Visual-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Activating and Using Visual Intelligence</h2>\r<br />\nTo use Visual Intelligence, you need to hold down on the Camera Control button for a few seconds to activate the Visual Intelligence mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJust pressing opens up the camera with Camera Control, so you do need a distinct press and hold gesture to get to it. Make sure you're not already in the Camera app, because it doesn't work if the camera is already active.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Visual Intelligence interface features a view from the camera, a button to capture a photo, and dedicated \"Ask\" and \"Search\" buttons. Ask queries ChatGPT, and Search sends an image to Google Search.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing Visual Intelligence requires taking a photo of whatever you're looking at. You need to snap a photo, which you can do with the Camera Control button, and select an option. It does not work with a live camera view, and you cannot use photos that you took previously.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Get Details About Places</h2>\r<br />\nIf you're out somewhere and want to get more information about a restaurant or a retail store, click and hold Camera Control, and then click Camera Control again to take a photo or tap the name of the location at the top of the display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nFrom there, you can see the hours when the business is open, place an oder for delivery at relevant locations, view the menu, view offered services, make a reservation, call the business, or visit the location's website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Summarize Text</h2>\r<br />\nTake a photo of text from the Visual Intelligence interface. Choose the \"Summarize\" option to get a summary of what's written.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-summarize.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe Summarize option is useful for long blocks of text, but it is similar to other ‌Apple Intelligence‌ summaries so it is brief and not particularly in-depth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Read Text Out Loud</h2>\r<br />\nWhenever you take a Camera Control image of text, there is an option to hear it read aloud. To use this, just tap the \"Read Aloud\" button at the bottom of the display, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> will read it out loud in your selected ‌Siri‌ voice.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-read-aloud.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Translate Text</h2>\r<br />\nIf text that you capture with Visual Intelligence is not in your language (limited to English at this time), you'll see a \"Translate\" option. You can tap it to get an instant translation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-translate.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Go to Website Links</h2>\r<br />\nIf there's a link in an image that you capture with Visual Intelligence, you'll see a link that you can tap to visit the website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-websites.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Send Emails and Make Phone calls</h2>\r<br />\nIf there is an email address in an image, you can tap it to compose an email in the Mail app. Similarly, if there is a phone number, you'll see an option to call it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-email.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Create a Calendar Event</h2>\r<br />\nUsing Visual Intelligence on something that has a date will give you an option to add that event to your calendar.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-events.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Detect and Save Contact Info</h2>\r<br />\nFor phone numbers, email addresses, and addresses, Apple says you can add the information to a contact in the Contacts app. You can also open address in the Maps app. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Scan QR Codes</h2>\r<br />\nVisual Intelligence can be used to scan a QR code. With QR codes, you don't actually need to snap an image, you simply need to point the camera at the QR code and then tap the link that pops up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-qr-code.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nQR code scanning also works in the Camera app without Visual Intelligence active.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Ask ChatGPT</h2>\r<br />\nYou can take a photo of anything and tap on the \"Ask\" option to send it to ChatGPT while also asking a question about it. If you take a picture of an item with Visual Intelligence and want to know what it is, for example, you tap on Ask and then type in \"What is this?\" to get to a ChatGPT interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nChatGPT will respond, and you can type back if you have followup questions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVisual Intelligence uses the ChatGPT ‌Siri‌ integration, which is opt-in. By default, no data is collected, but if you sign in with an OpenAI account, ChatGPT can remember conversations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Search Google for Items</h2>\r<br />\nYou can take a picture of any item that you see and tap on the \"Search\" option to use Google Image Search to find it on the web. This is a feature that's useful for locating items that you might want to buy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-google-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nFor more on the features that you get with ‌Apple Intelligence‌, we have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">dedicated Apple Intelligence guide</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/\">iOS 18.2: What You Can Do With Visual Intelligence</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-2-what-you-can-do-with-visual-intelligence.2445369/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ca4bf8d2daa14ac98ab661e3eb42a85a42d428f4b436745aa68a6305e3f039f","category":"Apple"}
