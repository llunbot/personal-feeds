{"title":"iMazing 3: Coming Soon","link":"https://imazing.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=imazing3beta&coupon=FIREBALL-IMAZING3","date":1697408620000,"content":"\n<p>My thanks to iMazing for sponsoring last week at DF to promote iMazing 3, the world’s favorite iPhone manager. Version 3.0 is nearing release — the biggest in their 15-year history. There’s no other iPhone management utility like iMazing.</p>\n\n<p>Rethought, rewritten, and redesigned from the ground up, Daring Fireball readers are invited to check out the MacOS beta of iMazing 3 today. Even better: DF readers can save 30% on any personal license for a limited time. All purchases are valid for the MacOS and Windows versions of iMazing 2 and iMazing 3, due out later this year.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/15/imazing-3\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"22caeea5a5ce1dd9175e33269a8616fb509cb1daf781eaf75cf4b56c9309ee94","category":"Tech"}
