It's not always clear if particularly good deals will last all the way through Black Friday and Cyber Monday, or disappear before the shopping holidays, so in this article we're highlighting all of the best Apple-related sales you can get as of today. If anything interests you, we recommend shopping as soon as possible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/General-black-friday-20-sale-feature.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

Although there may be instances in which this is beneficial for certain people, overall the best deals and bargains on Apple products won't be found on Apple.com during the week of Black Friday, but on Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, B&amp;H Photo, and other similar retailers. For this reason, you'll see a focus on these third-party retailers in this article.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Pro</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-pro-pink-holiday.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> AirPods Pro with MagSafe for $159.00</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481\">Walmart</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the overall standout deals this week is looking to be Walmart's $90 markdown on the new <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481\">AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case</a>. It's available for $159.00 today at Walmart, down from $249.00. <strong>This sale will begin as an exclusive for Walmart+ members at 3 p.m. EST today, and once 7 p.m. EST hits it will open up to all shoppers.</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe expect this sale to sell out fairly quickly, so act fast if you're interested. There's a possibility that other retailers like Amazon could match this sale price, but as of now Amazon has the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods Pro with MagSafe at $169.99</a>, down from $249.00.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Max</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-max-pink-holiday.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> AirPods Max in select colors for $439.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">Amazon</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe began tracking a new deal on the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods Max</a> earlier today, with Amazon now discounting the high-end headphones to $439.99, down from $549.00. Although we've seen a slightly better deal in the past (down to $429), it's unclear if this will return any time soon. Because this new sale still offers over $100 in savings on the AirPods Max, and because we don't know how long it'll last, we recommend anyone still on the fence about Apple's expensive headphones to visit Amazon soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Watch</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-watch-pink-holiday.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> Series 3 models from $109.00; SE from $219.99</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-40mm-silver-aluminum-case-with-white-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606310\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G93BDQP%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us3%3Fth%3D1\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/633495/10014?prodsku=6215914&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6215914%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=APIG_4831\">Best Buy</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the older Apple Watch models - Series 3 and SE - now is a great time to purchase the smartwatches.

At $90 off, these are fantastic sales and great entry points into the Apple Watch family for anyone who's fine with owning an older model. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Stock is fluctuating on these devices, and it appears that the initial 3 p.m. EST drop for Walmart+ subscribers has sold out. However, it's likely that more stock will appear at 7 p.m. EST tonight, when Walmart's sale opens up to all shoppers.</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTarget is offering the <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-40mm-silver-aluminum-case-with-white-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606310\">40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for $219.99</a>, down from $279.00.

Target shoppers should remember that you can get an additional 5 percent off your order with the Target RedCard.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you do want to own the latest and greatest Apple Watch, the best sales you'll find as of today are <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09HF1DC1J%2Fref%3Dfs_a_wt2_us1\">$19 off Series 7 models on Amazon</a>. This is only for select models, and some discounts only reach up to $9 off. Because of this, in order to optimize savings we recommend checking out the Series 3 and SE sales mentioned above, as these are the prime example of super rare holiday discounts that won't last long.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Gift Card</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-gift-card-pink-holiday.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> $15 in store credit when purchasing $100 Apple Gift Card</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-gift-card-holiday-limited-edition-app-store-itunes-iphone-ipad-airpods-and-accessories-green-email-delivery%2F-%2FA-84690231%3Fpreselect%3D84294410%23lnk%3Dsametab\">Target</a> and <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-gift-card-holiday-limited-edition-app-store-apple-music-itunes-iphone-ipad-airpods-accessories-and-more-digital%2F6480951.p%3FskuId%3D6480951\">Best Buy</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDepending on which retailer you prefer, you can get a $15 gift card from Target and Best Buy when purchasing the $100 Apple Gift Card. These are the best offers you'll find this season on the new Apple Gift Card, as we don't see straight cash discounts on these gift cards. If you were planning to buy an Apple Gift Card already, the $15 store credit could also help knock down the price of an <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-40mm-silver-aluminum-case-with-white-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606310\">Apple Watch SE</a> or <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3Dairpods\">pair of AirPods</a> to an even steeper all-time low price.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iMac</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/imac-pink-holiday.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> Record low prices on 2021 iMacs</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09327QT78%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\">Amazon</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon has Apple's M1 24-inch iMac at $50 off in multiple configurations, starting at $1,249.00 for the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932FC8XR%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\">M1 iMac with 7-Core GPU/256GB</a>, down from $1,299.00.
