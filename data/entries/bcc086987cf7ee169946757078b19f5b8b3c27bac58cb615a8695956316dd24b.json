{"title":"CIRP Survey Suggests 78 Percent of All Apple Customers Own an iPad","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/04/ipad-is-a-much-bigger-hit-than-you-probably-thought/","date":1749241218000,"content":"\n<p>Ryan Christoffel, writing at 9to5Mac regarding <a href=\"https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/rethinking-the-apple-ecosystem\">a paywalled survey report from CIRP</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CIRP recently performed a survey of Apple customers to get a sense\nof how the company’s three tentpole products — iPhone, iPad, and\nMac — are performing. One focus was on understanding the power of\nApple’s ecosystem, as determined by customers who own multiple\nproducts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/rethinking-the-apple-ecosystem\">Michael Levin and Josh Lowitz write at CIRP</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>iPhone remains the most dominant product, with 94% of recent\nApple customers owning one. iPads are next, with 78% owning one.\nMac computers have much smaller penetration, at 36% of recent\ncustomers.</p>\n\n<p>74% of customers, virtually all iPad owners, own an iPad and an\niPhone. Only 30% own all three, as that number is limited by\nApple customers’ relative lack of Macs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Different people may draw their own conclusions on the data, but\nfor me, the most interesting element is easily the iPad’s\npopularity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t find this surprising. But if it’s true, it truly shows just how much longer people hold onto their iPads than their iPhones. If the average customer replaced their iPad as frequently as they do their iPhone, you’d expect Apple’s iPad revenue to be remarkably close to their iPhone revenue. But they’re not close. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/05/apple-q2-2025-results-and-charts-95-4b-revenue/\">In their most recent quarter</a>, iPhone revenue was 7× iPad revenue. And Mac revenue was slightly ahead of iPad revenue — but that might be more a function of average selling prices being so much higher for Macs than iPads, not replacement cycles.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/06/cirp-survey-ipad-popularity\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bcc086987cf7ee169946757078b19f5b8b3c27bac58cb615a8695956316dd24b","category":"Tech"}
