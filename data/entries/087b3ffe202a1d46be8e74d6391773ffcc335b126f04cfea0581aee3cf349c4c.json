{"title":"Trump Media Plunges as Truth Social’s $58 Million Loss Reported","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/01/truth-social-trump-media-results/","date":1712021813000,"content":"\n<p>Drew Harwell, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Former president Donald Trump’s social media company said Monday \nit lost more than $58 million last year, sending its stock \nplunging more than 21 percent only days after a highflying public \ndebut set the company’s value at more than $8 billion. </p>\n\n<p>Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, said in \na Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the company \ngenerated just over $4 million in revenue last year, including \nless than $1 million in the last quarter. </p>\n\n<p>The nosediving share price of the company — which uses the stock \nticker DJT, for Trump’s initials — fell to its lowest level since \nTrump Media went public last week and shaved more than a fifth of \nits market value in a single day. It also slashed the value of \nTrump’s 57 percent ownership in the company by roughly $1 billion, \nto $3.8 billion. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The company’s 8-K filing <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/understanding-papa-dons-new-pump-and-dump-8-k\">is just bananas</a>. They not only aren’t turning a profit, they don’t foresee ever making one. They don’t track any sort of metrics typical for a social media company — signups, monthly active users, average revenue per user — none of it. And they don’t plan to, either. To call it a scam gives scams a bad name.</p>\n\n<p>I want to laugh, but: If Trump is elected again in November — which, based on the close results of 2016 and 2020, and the current polling data, is definitely possible — shaking down lobbyists and foreign governments with exorbitant rates for ads on Truth Social seems like a much better grift than <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/16/tmobile-trump-international\">running a hotel across the street from the White House</a>. A corrupt president owning a social media site would be a grift that scales. If there’s any rational reason for Trump Media to have any value at all, it’s that. It’s worthless today, but could be a veritable goldmine in a second Trump administration.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/01/trump-media-plunges\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"087b3ffe202a1d46be8e74d6391773ffcc335b126f04cfea0581aee3cf349c4c","category":"Tech"}
