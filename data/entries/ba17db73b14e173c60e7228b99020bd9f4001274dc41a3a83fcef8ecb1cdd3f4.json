Â Lots of news as always, but what I'm most interested in is the launch of the Polaris Dawn mission. If all goes as planned, the flight will break all sorts of ground for commercial spaceflight, including the first-ever private spacewalk.

It's a notable event for the European commercial space industry as the German launch startup aimed to send its first rocket into space later this year and appeared to be running ahead of several competitors in Europe's commercial launch industry that are also developing rockets to deploy small satellites in orbit. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy54wqzz0kvo\">BBC obtained video</a> of the fiery explosion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044779#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044779&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ba17db73b14e173c60e7228b99020bd9f4001274dc41a3a83fcef8ecb1cdd3f4","category":"Tech"}
