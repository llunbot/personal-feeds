Apple suppliers have <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-suppliers-warn-China-s-energy-rules-threaten-supply-chain\">reportedly</a> already warned that power cuts threaten supply chain continuity, but concerns have grown that the disruption will last until the end of the year or longer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSuppliers are also reporting a lack of clarity over who will receive power and who won't from one week to the next.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"It is very chaotic and confusing. Some suppliers managed to secure power supplies based on their friendly relations and negotiations with the local governments, while some were affected badly,\" an executive at an Apple supplier told Nikkei Asia. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMany large Chinese tech suppliers, such as emerging iPhone assembler Luxshare and its subsidiaries across different provinces, were also spared from the power suspension, according to three people familiar with the matter.</blockquote>Another unnamed Apple supplier said that local governments are deciding who to give electricity to based in part on the value of the products being made.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is looking to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-boosting-iphone-13-production/\">boost initial production</a> of this year's ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>‌ models to 90 million units through the end of the year, an increase of up to 20% over the 75 million units of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> series produced last year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. There are also reports that initial stocks of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> will be limited, but we won't know for sure until Apple opens pre-orders later today.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/power-outages-china-apple-suppliers-scrambling/\">Widespread Power Outages in China Have Apple Suppliers 'Scrambling' to Keep Production on Track</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/widespread-power-outages-in-china-have-apple-suppliers-scrambling-to-keep-production-on-track.2315971/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=q2oiRS3j7LY:FElUOeUNSHM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=q2oiRS3j7LY:FElUOeUNSHM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/q2oiRS3j7LY\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4cac7f3a4067107e064aa1a4c0336dec86e72652a92adc45eb1e0a23c3364792","category":"Apple"}
