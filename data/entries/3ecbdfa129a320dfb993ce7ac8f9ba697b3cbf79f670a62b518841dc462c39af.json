The single outlier was, ironically, the eventual winner, Germany’s Niklas Behrens who rides for Lidl-Trek Future Racing (a development squad for the American WorldTour team). Now a rainbow jersey wearer, there’s no doubt that WorldTour outfits will be fighting for Behrens’ signature in the coming months – if he doesn’t have an agreement already. Do these results indicate that the under-23 category is becoming redundant in professional cycling?</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Speaking to a room of journalists in his annual press conference at the World Championships, UCI President David Lappartient acknowledged that there are ongoing discussions within the UCI management committee regarding this subject.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The goal of this category was to be the link between juniors and elite level, but we can see it is already elite level,” the Frenchman said. “This category was decided because the gap between junior and elite riders was too big. We have to recognise that 30 years later, things have changed and there are real discussions about whether it is still appropriate for us to have this category.”</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-9192_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727531617\" /></div>\n<p><span> <em>Niklas Behrens celebrates winning the under-23 men's race in Zurich (Image: Zac Williams/SWpix)</em></span></p>\n<p><span>Lappartient stated that on a personal level, he believes that the under-23 race is still necessary but thinks that considerations should be made as to whether having the category spanning four years is still the correct choice, suggesting that this may be reduced in the future (but that discussions with national federations would come first). With riders such as Remco Evenepoel, Tadej Pogačar and Josh Tarling able to win in the professional ranks almost immediately after leaving the junior category, Lappartient believes that the category needs to evolve as the stars of the sport get younger.</span></p>\n<p>Some steps have already been taken by the UCI to try and return the under-23 category at the World Championships to its original purpose. Earlier this week, it was announced that from next year, professional riders won't be allowed to take part in the under-23 race at the World Championships.</p>\n<p><span>“The UCI management committee took the decision this week that in the under-23 category, those riding in a WorldTour team or ProTeam team will not be allowed to take part in the under-23 World Championships as normally they are more suited to the elite World Championships,” Lappartient confirmed.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We also spoke about the possible need to change it so the under-23 should become under-22 or under-21 or under-20. Sometimes things like this go on for years and we have to ask ourselves if what we do is still appropriate for the current situation. We have to recognise that even juniors are signing contracts so it’s moving and becoming earlier and earlier,” he added.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-08542_1b395f6b-c0c1-4b6e-856a-59edf8b94b31_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727531692\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>The under-23 men's peloton at the 2024 World Championships (Image: Zac Williams/SWpix)</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Despite the questions being raised about the place of an under-23 category in cycling on the men’s side of the sport, next year’s World Championships in Rwanda will see the introduction of a standalone women’s under-23 race for the first time. Lappartient stated the importance of this for the sake of equality, and also added that the rules regarding which riders will be eligible to participate in this event will be confirmed in January. It’s not yet official whether riders contracted to Women’s WorldTour teams and ProTeams (a new category to be introduced to the women’s side of the sport next season) will be able to ride in the new women’s under-23 race.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We need to clarify for under-23 women about whether they can ride in the race as part of a WorldTour team. We don't want to have a category that will have no impact,” he said. “We have to recognise that the size of the women's bunch is not the same as the men's. It’s something we need to have full details about and to make a decision at the UCI World Committee in January.”</span></p>\n<p><span>During his press conference, Lappartient went so far as to mention potential changes to the junior category in the sport too.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We have questions from some countries about making junior categories include 16, 17 and 18 year olds and this would also help women’s cycling to bring more athletes together. This is an open question, it will not be for next year but we need to anticipate these things and we believe that could potentially be an option. It is the start of the process,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span>While it is clear that the sport has undergone a significant change in recent years with riders like Evenepoel and Pogačar able to win at such a young age, it’s important to note that these riders are unique and not everyone develops at such a rapid rate. For many, the under-23 category is still crucial to ensuring steady growth and nurturing of talent. Lappartient was clear that nothing will happen in the immediate future, but his words also indicate that change is on the horizon. The under-23 men’s category was first introduced in 1996, 28 years later, are we going to see it phased out all over again?</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"3ecbdfa129a320dfb993ce7ac8f9ba697b3cbf79f670a62b518841dc462c39af","category":"Cycling"}
