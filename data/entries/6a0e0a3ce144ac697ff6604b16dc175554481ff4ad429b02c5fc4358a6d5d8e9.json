The new Ride1Up Rift ebike was made just for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company’s new <a href=\"https://ride1up.com/product/rift/\" target=\"_blank\">Rift model</a> isn’t just a reasonably priced ebike with big, all-terrain-capable tires — it’s also possible to add a Passenger Kit (padded seat and foot pegs) and take someone for an assisted ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This beastly bicycle comes with 26×4″ <a href=\"https://www.kendatire.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Kenda</a> fatbike tires, a 120mm suspension fork, proper 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes, and an integrated rear rack built directly into the aluminum frame that can haul up to 150lb/68 kg. The rear rack features the company’s <a href=\"https://ride1up.com/product/basket/\" target=\"_blank\">Connect+ system</a> for quickly swapping out accessories, and riders can also add a front rack for extra storage — like beer &amp; pizza. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride1Up Rift all-terrain fat tire ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"woman with Rift e-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/woman-with-bike.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Rift comes in three colors, including Forest Green, Graphite Gray and Arctic White (above). </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the battery, the Rift offers plenty of power with 960Wh inside the high-capacity battery, powering a 750W hub motor for a peak 95Nm of torque. Other features include full-coverage fenders and integrated lights, both the front and rear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rift is available in both Step-Through and Step-Over frame styles, and has an MSRP of about $1,900. But if you want that sweet <a href=\"https://ride1up.com/product/electric-bike-passenger-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">Passenger Kit</a>, you’ll have to shell out another $125. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, the price of friendship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Or if you’re looking for an even cheaper e-bike with Ride1Up’s same sense of style, check out the company’s $1,300 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride1up-turris-best-starter-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Turris</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://ride1up.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ride1Up.com</em></a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride1up-rift-fat-e-bike/\">Ride1Up Builds Rift Fat eBike with Integrated Rear Rack That Can Haul a Friend</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Andrew McLemore","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6a0e0a3ce144ac697ff6604b16dc175554481ff4ad429b02c5fc4358a6d5d8e9","category":"Cycling"}
