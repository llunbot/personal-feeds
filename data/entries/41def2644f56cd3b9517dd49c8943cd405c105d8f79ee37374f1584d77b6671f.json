{"title":"Apple Moves Kim Vorrath to Siri / Apple Intelligence Team","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-24/apple-enlists-company-veteran-kim-vorrath-to-help-fix-ai-and-siri","date":1737767995000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman has an interesting scoop at Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for\nfixing troubled products and bringing major projects to\nmarket, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and\nSiri into shape.</p>\n\n<p>Vorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was\nmoved to Apple’s artificial intelligence and machine learning\ndivision this week, according to people with knowledge of the\nmatter. She’ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said\nthe people, who asked not to be identified because the change\nhasn’t been announced publicly. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple’s\nbiggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead\nproject management for the original iPhone software group and get\nthe iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw\nproject management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems,\nbefore taking on the Vision Pro software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somehow Vorrath’s name has never before appeared on Daring Fireball, but she’s renowned within Apple, legendary even, for her leadership role in managing the creation and development of the software for the original iPhone, effectively serving as Scott Forstall’s chief of staff. Her reputation is that she’s a great manager — she gets shit done, knows how to ship, and talented people enjoy and thrive working for her. But outside Apple she’s largely flown under the radar — which only emphasizes how much of an Apple person’s Apple person she is.</p>\n\n<p>I checked with a source who’s worked with Vorrath for years, and their comment says it all: “She kicks all the asses.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision\nPro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest\nchallenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple\nexecutive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for\norganizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow\nwith new processes, the executive said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My sense is that it’s less about Siri and Apple Intelligence being more important than VisionOS, and more about Siri being a mess. More about urgency than importance. But perhaps it’s <em>both</em> more urgent and more important long-term. Either way, assigning Vorrath — perhaps Apple’s best fixer — makes sense. As <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber\">my piece yesterday illustrated</a>, something is rotten in the state of SiriLand.</p>\n\n<p>Also very interesting: Gurman citing “a longtime Apple executive” as his source. Not “a source familiar with the matter”, but “a longtime Apple executive”. No “former” in there either. Apple generally doesn’t want personnel changes made public, but this one, I think is an exception. Siri is terrible, far behind the competition, and everyone from Cupertino to Wall Street knows it.</p>\n\n<p>Apple sending in Kim Vorrath is like Marsellus Wallace sending in Winston Wolfe.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/vorrath-siri-apple-intelligence\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"41def2644f56cd3b9517dd49c8943cd405c105d8f79ee37374f1584d77b6671f","category":"Tech"}
