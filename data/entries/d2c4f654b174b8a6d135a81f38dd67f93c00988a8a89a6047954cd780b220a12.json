Get ready for an adrenaline-fuelled episode as they tackle Chile’s lava trails, surrounded by the breathtaking beauty of Pucon’s crystal-clear lakes, lush forests, and remarkable volcanoes. The SCOR Crew hikes up to conquer scree-slope freeride lines, discovers a singletrack that flows like lava, and collaborates with the local community to build backyard jump lines in the rainforest. Along the way, Ludo attempts to master the pan pipes.. with mixed success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/a-chilean-odyssey-by-scor/\" target=\"_blank\"> Episode 1 here</a>!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/a-chilean-odyssey-by-scor-ep-2/\">A Chilean Odyssey by SCOR – Ep. 2</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d2c4f654b174b8a6d135a81f38dd67f93c00988a8a89a6047954cd780b220a12","category":"Cycling"}
