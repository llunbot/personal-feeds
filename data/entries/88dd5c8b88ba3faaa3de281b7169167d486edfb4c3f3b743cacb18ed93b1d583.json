Under California law, employers must give employees and state representatives a 60-day notice before a mass layoff event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-yellow.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe employees listed are located in several Apple-occupied buildings around Santa Clara, California, which is close to Apple's Cupertino headquarters. Several of these locations were rumored to be associated with Apple Car development in the past, so it is likely that these layoffs are related to Apple's decision to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/\">stop work on the car project</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple officially ended development on the Apple Car in March. Approximately 2,000 employees working on the Apple Car were told that the project was winding down at that time, and Apple began the process of moving some of them to work on artificial intelligence under John Giannandrea and in other relevant departments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther employees were given 90 days to apply for open positions within the company, but Apple hired hardware engineers and car designers while working on the Apple Car, and these employees may not have had skills applicable to other projects.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-ends-microled-apple-watch-development/\">recently ended development</a> on in-house microLED displays, so some of the layoffs might also be related to the decision to discontinue that work.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-employee-layoffs-car-project/\">Apple Lays Off 600+ Employees After Canceling Car Project</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lays-off-600-employees-after-canceling-car-project.2423567/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88dd5c8b88ba3faaa3de281b7169167d486edfb4c3f3b743cacb18ed93b1d583","category":"Apple"}
