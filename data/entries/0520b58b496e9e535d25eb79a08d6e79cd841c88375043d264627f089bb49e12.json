A Pirelli technology that is said to be directly derived from the UHP car tires of the Prestige segment. In addition to this super understated (and cool) aesthetic feature, the product comes with a different packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-package--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8256\" height=\"8256\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-package--jpg.webp\" alt=\"P-ZERO Race TLR NERO Tire package\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The TLR NERO arrives in an<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds7FRivVMgA\" target=\"_blank\"> all-black</a> (super goth) packaging that looks more like the Metallica Black Album than a cycling product.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-Side-walla-.png\"><img width=\"1398\" height=\"914\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-Side-walla-.png\" alt=\"P-ZERO Race TLR NERO Tire Side wall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-Side-walla-.png 1398w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-Side-walla--297x194.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-Side-walla--120x78.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P-ZERO-Race-TLR-NERO-Tire-Side-walla--768x502.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/made-in-italy-logo-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/made-in-italy-logo-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"P-ZERO Race TLR NERO Tire catalog\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/made-in-italy-logo-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/made-in-italy-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/made-in-italy-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/made-in-italy-logo-768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>P-ZERO Race TLR NERO – Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be disappointed if you’re looking for some super secret sauce for the P-ZERO Race TLR NERO. It is, on all accounts, the same (technology-wise) as the other P-ZERO Race TLR Tires, but it looks slightly more remarkable, which can add some watts to your ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pirelli-P-ZERO-RACE-Profile-.png\"><img width=\"2022\" height=\"1388\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pirelli-P-ZERO-RACE-Profile-.png\" alt=\"Pirelli P ZERO RACE Profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pirelli-P-ZERO-RACE-Profile-.png 2022w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pirelli-P-ZERO-RACE-Profile--297x204.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pirelli-P-ZERO-RACE-Profile--1536x1054.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pirelli-P-ZERO-RACE-Profile--120x82.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pirelli-P-ZERO-RACE-Profile--768x527.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new P-ZERO Race TLR NERO tires are available in 28 and 30mm widths and will be <a href=\"https://www.pirelli.com/tyres/en-ww/bike/tyres/catalogue/p-zero-race-tlr\">available online and through Pirelli Dealers</a>. <strong>Price:</strong> $85</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pirelli-p-zero-race-tlr-nero-all-black-raod-bike-tire/\">Tires Can Get None More Black Than New Pirelli P-ZERO Race TLR NERO</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0520b58b496e9e535d25eb79a08d6e79cd841c88375043d264627f089bb49e12","category":"Cycling"}
