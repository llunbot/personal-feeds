It also\noffers protection from hackers and network operators, similar to\nany other VPN.</p>\n\n<p>With this change, storage space is the primary differentiating\nfactor between Google One plans. The basic plan offers 100GB of\nstorage, while the Premium plan offers 2TB. There’s also a free\ntier with 15GB of storage, but it does not include VPN access.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Using a VPN does prevent sites and apps from tracking or monitoring you. But your VPN <em>provider</em> can see every site you visit, and every app you use (other than apps that never do anything on the internet). VPN usage data is so lucrative to a surveillance advertising company that just a few years ago, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/29/facebook-teens-vpn\">Facebook was <em>paying</em> users aged 13 to 35</a> up to $20 per month to use their “Facebook Research” VPN app. A VPN app from Google is a hard pass for me.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/09/google-one-vpn\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c79ececada5bc3c975f957be0ea73ab85f9d71d75f8fe496110356a612670260","category":"Tech"}
