To participate, you can start from anywhere and cover any distance over 25 miles. It breaks down to several distance brackets: more than 25 miles (40 km), more than 50 miles (80 km), more than 100 miles (160 km) or more than 200 miles (320 km).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kickers: Start time is 6 a.m. local time (“SHARP!”), you can only stop twice, and post-ride celebration is “mandatory.” The event’s co-sponsors call it a “race,” but it’s unclear whether you can win or lose. As well, the million-mile benchmark looks somewhat random. If the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/link-my-ride-app-makes-it-easy-to-find-create-group-rides/\" target=\"_blank\">whole world rides a million miles</a> on this semi-sanctioned basis on June 3, it does not appear that balloons will tumble from the sky as fireworks go off.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebound is free to enter and there are prizes on the line — evidently available via something like a raffle, rather than on merit — and you’ll ride in a wide-ranging peloton in a discipline that Shimano and LSRF call the great equalizer of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s where friends are made, and memories are forged. Whether you’re riding one mile or one hundred; have pro kit or no kit; ride a 10-speed or 11-speed; or hitting paved roads, fire roads, b-roads, or no roads at all,” the press release said. “It doesn’t matter why you’re out there — it only matters that you are,” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saddle up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://rebound.cc/register\" target=\"_blank\">rebound.cc/register</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-rebound-live-slow-ride-fast-group-ride/\">(Help) Ride a Million Miles in a Day with Shimano’s Huge Group Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"78120be8046ed965ef3984bed5017d974d9bf9f22f11826bacb8bec940fc3fef","category":"Cycling"}
