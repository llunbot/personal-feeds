Amateur level races will also be held, with riders competing for prizes rather than money. </p><p>“Ride your bikes, wear costumes and enjoy the community Halloween event,” Williams said. “Get hooked on criterium racing during the open races, and then watch current and former National Champions go full-gas in the pro crits.”</p><p>Justin and Corey Williams’ L39ION squad has enjoyed a stellar debut season, winning both the men’s and women’s GC at the Joe Martin Stage Race and dominating most rounds of the USA Crits series.</p></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"90b197044e1250197848521bcb6bb23260f83d0c7e0648113e56b6f6f1607f84","category":"Cycling"}
