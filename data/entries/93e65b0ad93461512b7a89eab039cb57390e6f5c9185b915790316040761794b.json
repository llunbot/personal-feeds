And, worse yet, the labels that say the inks are sterile are not reliable.</p>\n<p>But, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/sierra-stain-recalls-tattoo-pigments-because-possible-health-risk\">a recent recall of three tattoo pigments</a> from the same manufacturer does a good job of illustrating the FDA's concerns. The water-based inks, all from Sierra Stain, had a bizarre array of bacteria, which were found at high levels, according to FDA testing.</p>\n<p>One ink product—described as \"Carolina Blue\"—offered a microbial menagerie, with six odd species identified. They included a bacterium that often dwells in the gastrointestinal system and can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10909985/\">inflame the mucosal lining of the intestines</a> (<em>Citrobacter braakii</em>), a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897476/'\">water-borne bacterium</a> (<em>Cupriavidus pauculus</em>), and several that cause opportunistic infections (<em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849549/\">Citrobacter farmer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166261/\">Achromobacter xylosoxidans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9499045/\">Ochrobactrum anthropi</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187640/\">Pseudomonas fluorescens</a></em>). These are bacteria that don't typically go about attacking humans but will if the conditions are right, including when they find themselves inside a human with a compromised immune system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045628#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045628&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"93e65b0ad93461512b7a89eab039cb57390e6f5c9185b915790316040761794b","category":"Tech"}
