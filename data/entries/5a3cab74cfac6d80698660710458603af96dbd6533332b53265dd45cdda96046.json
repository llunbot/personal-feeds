Instead, he reiterated that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/\">held discussions with companies such as Google, OpenAI, and Baidu</a> about potential generative AI partnerships.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nRecent reports indicated that Apple has considered licensing existing chatbots, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/\">Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>, but Apple offering its own chatbot of some kind on iOS 18 had not been explicitly ruled out until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman still expects AI to be a major focus at Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/\">just-announced WWDC 2024 developers conference</a>.
