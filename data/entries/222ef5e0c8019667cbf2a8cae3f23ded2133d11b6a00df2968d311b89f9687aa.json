{"title":"★ Phony Stark Picks on the Wrong Guy, Attempting (and of Course Botching) an HR Exit Interview Live on Twitter","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/thorleifsson_musk_twitter","date":1678217116000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64871183\">James Clayton, reporting for BBC News</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a tweet to the firm’s chief executive, Halli Thorleifsson said:\n“Your head of HR is not able to confirm if I am employed or not”.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Musk responded by asking: “What work have you been doing?”</p>\n\n<p>Mr Thorleifsson told the BBC that nine days after being frozen out\nof Twitter’s accounts he did not know whether he had been fired or\nnot. After a series of follow up questions and answers with Mr\nMusk, that read like a live interview for his job, Mr Thorleifsson\nsaid he received an email confirming that he had been sacked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’ve been staying away from Twitter, you’re smarter than me, but you might have missed this saga, and it is, I promise you, worth your attention. It started last night with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamharaldur/status/1632843191773716481\">Thorleifsson mentioning Musk in a tweet to ask whether he was still employed</a>, and Musk then engaged in the most dismissive way possible. It was like reality TV on Twitter. As absurd and offensive as you might think their back-and-forth exchange was, I guarantee you’re low-balling it. At one point, after having been asked by Musk what he’s accomplished recently, Thorleifsson said he “led the effort to save about $500k on one SaaS contract”. Musk asked which SaaS contract. Thorleifsson replied “Figma”. Musk then replied “🤣🤣”. Best guess as to why Musk responded thus is that Musk doesn’t know what Figma is and thought Thorleifsson was making a “<a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/ligma/\">ligma</a>” joke.</p>\n\n<p><em>That’s</em> the thread that prompted Clayton to file the above story with the BBC. But it gets worse/more absurd — but ultimately, better. Early this morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1633011448459964417\">Musk tweeted</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reality is that this guy (who is independently wealthy) did\nno actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability\nthat prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting\nup a storm.</p>\n\n<p>Can’t say I have a lot of respect for that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thorleifsson <em>graciously</em> (good god where does his patience and serenity come from?) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamharaldur/status/1633082709751869440\">responded to Musk</a>, explaining that he has muscular dystrophy, lost the use of his legs 20 years ago, and while he <em>can</em> and does type, his arms tire and his hands cramp after an hour or two:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And now finally to my fingers, which I know you have great concern\nfor. Thank you for that btw. I’ll tell you what I told them. I’m\nnot able to do manual work (which in this case means typing or\nusing a mouse) for extended periods of time without my hands\nstarting to cramp.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn’t a problem in Twitter 1.0 since I was a senior director\nand my job was mostly to help teams move forward, give them\nstrategic and tactical guidance. But as I told HR (I’m assuming\nthat’s the confidential health information you are sharing) I\ncan’t work as a hands on designer for the reasons outlined above.</p>\n\n<p>I’m typing this on my phone btw. It’s easier for me because I only\nneed to use one finger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The notion that a design leader can only “work” while their hands are on a keyboard and trackpad/mouse is, of course, patently offensive. (Also: illegal?) Thorleifsson is an award-winning designer and his design agency, Ueno, which Twitter acquired, <a href=\"https://ueno.co/clients/\">was highly regarded and accomplished</a>. His personal website <a href=\"http://haraldurthorleifsson.com\">is a delightful, pitch-perfect homage to Hergé’s Tintin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>He’s so renowned that in January <a href=\"https://www.icelandreview.com/news/haraldur-thorleifsson-sweeps-person-of-the-year-awards/\">Thorleifsson was named Iceland’s Person of the Year</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Halli, a 45 year-old designer, gained nation-wide recognition this\nyear when, after the sale of his tech company Ueno to Twitter, he\nchose to be paid the sale price as wages. Normally in such large\nsales, the payment comes in the form of stock or other financial\ninstruments, which categorize the sale as capital gains, meaning\nit is taxed at a much lower rate. Halli, however, gladly paid the\nhigher tax rate, having spoken publicly on many occasions about\nthe benefits he has received from the Icelandic social system.</p>\n\n<p>Halli was born with muscular dystrophy and came from a working\nclass background. In statements about his decision to pay back\ninto the Icelandic social system, he cited both healthcare and\neducation in Iceland as keys to his success. Notably,<a href=\"https://www.icelandreview.com/news/annual-list-of-highest-tax-payers-in-iceland-published\"> he was\none of the highest tax payers in the nation</a> after the\nsale of Ueno. [...]</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icelandreview.com/news/president-raises-goal-to-1500-ramps/\">One of his best-known projects is Ramp Up Iceland</a>, which\nis building ramps throughout the nation to increase accessibility\nfor people in wheelchairs. He has also personally donated to the\nlegal funds of victims of sexual abuse, and has garnered praise\nfor charitable donations to families in need this holiday season.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thorleifsson, to put it mildly, is a rather extraordinary and inspiring person.</p>\n\n<p>He also seems to be remarkably clever. Thorleifsson wasn’t a regular at-will employee at Twitter; he had a contract as the founder of an acquired company, and the entire thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/courtneymilan/status/1633141759063605251\">is best read as his having baited Musk</a>, successfully, into breaching that contract <em>in public</em>. (<a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/in-latest-round-of-twitter-cuts-some?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2FThorleifsson&amp;utm_medium=reader2\">According to Zoë Schiffer and Casey Newton at Platformer</a>, Thorleifsson was on a “do not fire” list inside Twitter, because breaking his contract would be so expensive for the company.)</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Thorleifsson has a sharp sense of humor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamharaldur/status/1633086380254298113\">having concluded his thread this morning thus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oh! I forgot to mention that I read you can’t go to the toilet on\nyour own either @elonmusk.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sorry to hear about that. I know the feeling.</p>\n\n<p>The only difference is I can’t do it because of a physical\ndisability and you’re afraid someone you hurt will attack you\nwhile you poop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Musk himself might say, “🤣🤣”. Drop the mic, Halli, your work is done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Epilogue:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1633261069534724096\">Musk apologizes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"222ef5e0c8019667cbf2a8cae3f23ded2133d11b6a00df2968d311b89f9687aa","category":"Tech"}
