The latest rumors claim that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2437509/report-apple-to-introduce-iphone-16-apple-watch-airpods-on-september-10.html\">an event will be held on Tuesday, September 10</a>, with four new models and possibly new AirPods or an iPad mini. However, a new report suggests that this year’s launch might be a little different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1827444195436720173\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, reporting on X</a>, “Apple has scheduled an unusual and mandatory meeting for employees at all Apple retail stores for the evening of Sept 12 or morning of Sept 13.” The meeting itself isn’t strange–Apple holds one every year to discuss the launch day logistics–but Gurman explains that these types of pre-launch meetings are usually held on the Sunday after the event (September 15) rather than on a weekday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A meeting on Thursday or Friday morning could mean an earlier launch than the typical Friday following the event (in this case, September 20), or it could simply mean that most employees would rather not come in on a Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it could also mean that something is launching on Friday, September 13, such as new AirPods. Or it could mean that Apple is forgoing its usual 10-day preorder period. Or perhaps it will start taking preorders in the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At any rate, it does mean that the iPhone 16 is coming very soon.
