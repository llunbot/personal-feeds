Russian IT sources told <em><a href=\"https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/02/2025/67b9be389a79470a2de2be8a?from=from_main_1?utm_source=telegram&amp;utm_medium=messenger\">RBC</a></em> that developers lost access to the platform on February 12.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe shutdown means Russian developers can no longer use ADEP to create and distribute custom iOS apps for internal use without going through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. A software company in St. Petersburg confirmed to the media outlet that all program data had been erased, making ADEP unusable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior to the cut-off, Apple apparently warned companies using Enterprise certificates that they would stop working by mid-February. The certificates allow developers to sign and distribute apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nADEP was widely used for app testing in Russia without publishing to the ‌App Store‌, but major corporations and developer companies in the country also relied on the platform for internal business apps, corporate chatbots, CRM systems, and logistics tools.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite Apple suspending product sales and limiting certain services like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ‌App Store‌ continues to operate within the country. However, Apple has complied with local regulations by removing certain applications, such as VPN services and specific news apps, after requests from Russian authorities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/technology/tech-companies/apple-cuts-off-russian-access/ar-AA1zEzgA\">MSN</a>.)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/russia/\">Russia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apple-developer-enterprise-program-russia/\">Apple Cuts Off Russian Access to Its Developer Enterprise Program</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-cuts-off-russian-access-to-its-developer-enterprise-program.2450151/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c5b93c63bc41c645a56ed62b53930c9f7f14610c511a1fb5cd0339412a8dce73","category":"Apple"}
