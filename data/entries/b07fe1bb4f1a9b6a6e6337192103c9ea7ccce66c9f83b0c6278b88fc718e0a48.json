The new Turbo Tero is a more all-terrain solution.</p>\n<p>Comfort is a key aspect to the range’s design, and Specialized’s development engineers in California and Switzerland are said to have spent a lot of time refining the feel of both the bikes and the motors – built by Brose to Specialized’s specs.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Turbo Tero</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized’s new Turbo Tero electric bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Turbo Tero is designed as a true all-terrain vehicle, built for getting across town, picking up shopping and then hitting local trails should you wish.</p>\n<p>As such, the bike features a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\" target=\"_blank\">suspension fork</a> with 110mm of travel, 2.3in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\" target=\"_blank\">mountain bike tyres</a>, luggage-carrying and trailer-towing capabilities, as well as integrated lighting.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Turbo Tero gets proper MTB tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The base-level Tero 3.0 / 3.0 ST (step-through) model uses Specialized’s 2.0 Brose motor and gets a 530Wh removable battery, for charging away from the bike, while the top-spec Tero 5.0 uses Specialized’s Full Power 2.2 motor, as seen on its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/specialized-s-works-turbo-levo-review/\">high-end electric mountain bikes</a>, and is fitted with a 710Wh battery that Specialized claims gives the bike a real-world 90-mile range.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes are a given, but you don’t see many kickstand mounts on a hardtail!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<h2>Specialized Turbo Vado</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Specialized Vado is said to be a “vehicle for everything”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Specialized says the Turbo Vado is designed to do everything from commutes to riding roads and trails.</p>\n<p>The bike has a large carrying capacity, with the maximum load on the rear rack boosted from 20kg to 27kg compared to the previous generation Vado.</p>\n<p>The bike can tow up to 60kg and carry an extra 15kg with Specialized’s yet-to-be-released front rack attachment.</p>\n<p>The bike has also switched from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\" target=\"_blank\">700c wheels to 650b</a>, which Specialized says allows for more nimble handling and improved comfort. Its suspension seatpost and 80mm suspension fork should also increase comfort.</p>\n<p>The Vado is available in 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0 models. The bikes are the same apart from the motor, battery and drivetrain.</p>\n<p>All models are equipped with fenders, integrated lights and Specialized’s new MasterMind+ display unit. Again, we are waiting on full specs, pricing and photos of the bikes.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Turbo Como</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Turbo Como is said to have the lowest step-through height of any Specialized bike, ever.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The Specialized Turbo Como bears a resemblance to classic town bikes with its upright position and low step-through.</p>\n<p>In fact, Specialized say it’s the lowest step-through frame it has ever designed, with the step-through height dropping from 526mm on the previous generation to 355mm on the new generation in a size large.</p>\n<p>Specialized has achieved this by changing the frame from a two-piece design to a new one-piece monocoque.</p>\n<p>Like the Turbo Vado, the Turbo Como has moved from 700c to 650b wheels with 2.3in Pathfinder tyres.</p>\n<p>The handlebar is integrated and houses Specialized’s MasterMind+ display unit. The bike also has integrated lights and mudguards.</p>\n<h2>Smart upgrades</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new on-bar display has plenty of data on offer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The range also sees a few extra features, to bolster security, useability and safety.</p>\n<p>The on-bar MasterMind+ controller has a colour, customisable display, which you can alter via the Mission Control app on your phone. This allows it to show a wide array of data in numerous forms to suit your needs.</p>\n<p>For example, there’s a feature that compares your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\" target=\"_blank\">cadence</a> to the most efficient for the motor – 70 to 80rpm according to Specialized – to help you get the most out of the bike’s battery. It’ll also look at your power input and the bike’s battery levels to work out the remaining range.</p>\n<p>The Mission Control app features on-ride diagnostics too, to quickly assess any issues and help get them fixed at a dealer. Also possible now are over-air updates to the bikes’ software, for when Specialized adds additional features.</p>\n<p>The MasterMind+ will also work seamlessly with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/albion-cycling-kit/#:~:text=Garmin%20Varia%20RTL515,RTL515%20rear%20radar\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin Varia radar units</a>. This is a small box that sits at the back of your bike to alert you when cars are approaching. Top models of the Como and Vado will come with a Garmin Varia built onto the bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Customisable, the screen shows any info you might want.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Other security features include a motion-sensitive alarm and system lock, so thieves won’t be able to access the motor’s power and will also have to listen to a constant alarm. Bikes can be flagged as stolen, so if they’re taken to a bike shop the staff will know it has been taken.</p>\n<p>In terms of liveability, Specialized has worked with a rack mount company to bring easily swappable, click-on-click-off rack carriers and child seats to the bikes, all of which fit onto the rear rack.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there will be a new Tailwind range of panniers. These are said to be aerodynamically shaped, and Specialized claims they offer a 6 per cent boost to battery range when compared to less aerodynamic panniers.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Turbo Vado has been a hit with BikeRadar’s testers in the past.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<h2>Closing the loop</h2>\n<p>Finally, Specialized is aware that building tens of thousands of bikes with large batteries has an environmental impact.</p>\n<p>In the US, it’s working with its retailers so old batteries can be taken and passed on to logistics partners, to then be taken to material recovery companies. Furthermore, Specialized says that parts for the bikes will be available for 10 years.</p>\n<h2>2022 Specialized Turbo Tero range and pricing</h2>\n<p>Specialized will initially offer four models of the Turbo Tero, but we’re yet to see full specs, international pricing and photos of all models.</p>\n<h3>Specialized Turbo Tero 3.0 / 3.0 ST (Step-through)</h3>\n<p>This base-level Tero comes with a 2.0 motor, 530Wh battery, Shimano Alivio groupset and SR Suntour XCM fork.</p>\n<ul><li>£2,900</li>\n</ul><h3>Specialized Turbo Tero 4.0</h3>\n<p>The 2.0 motor is powered by a 710Wh battery and driven by a SRAM NX drivetrain, while a RockShox Recon TK props up the front end.</p>\n<ul><li>£4,000</li>\n</ul><h3>Specialized Turbo Tero 4.0 EQ / 4.0 EQ ST</h3>\n<p>This fully-loaded bike is the same as the 4.0 but comes with lights, fenders, a rack and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-kickstand-doesnt-exist-yet/\">kickstand</a>.</p>\n<ul><li>£4,200</li>\n</ul><h3>Specialized Turbo Tero 5.0</h3>\n<p>Specialized’s top-level 2.2 motor and large 710Wh battery feature here.
