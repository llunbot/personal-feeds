{"title":"Textpattern Turns 20","link":"https://textpattern.com/weblog/textpattern-turns-twenty","date":1709144691000,"content":"\n<p>Stef Dawson, on the Textpattern blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Twenty years ago, the landscape was very different. There was \nadvertising, sure, but nowhere near the scale of today. And, \nperhaps to celebrate the fact that Dean Allen’s newly created CMS \nwas so small, nimble, lightweight, yet powerful — or perhaps \nbecause its creator was an eccentric genius — the fanfare \nsurrounding the official birth of Textpattern was this: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040407174458/http%3A//www.textpattern.com/\">Public Gamma 1.10</a> is up. I’m going to bed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040313194455/http%3A//www.textism.com/article/781/Textpattern\">from Textism</a>) </p>\n\n<p>That was it; the extent of the marketing campaign. Nothing more. \nNothing less. A factual statement and an indicator that the road \nto reach it from the numerous alpha and beta releases throughout \n2001 until its <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040312114829/http%3A//www.textism.com/article/661/Textpattern\">naming in 2003</a> and public release in 2004 \nhad been arduous, yet worth it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t hear about it much, but I’m so glad to see Textpattern is still going. And man do I still miss Dean Allen.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/28/textpattern-turns-20\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1ae797f4c1f0caac501f7678cdeff8c60c908a1098ed84e8efe7cc9be2169028","category":"Tech"}
