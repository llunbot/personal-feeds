They’ve recently teamed up with Accell, Canyon, Quality Bicycle Products, Rose, Schindelhauer, Schwalbe, Scott, and Trek to launch a free <a href=\"https://www.shiftcyclingculture.com/cat\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Action Training Course</a> for the cycling industry. They are hoping the course helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the cycling industry’s global supply chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Shift-Cycling-Culture-CAT-course-Trek-bikes-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"743\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Shift-Cycling-Culture-CAT-course-Trek-bikes-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Shift Cycling Culture CAT course Trek bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Shift-Cycling-Culture-CAT-course-Trek-bikes-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Shift-Cycling-Culture-CAT-course-Trek-bikes-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Shift-Cycling-Culture-CAT-course-Trek-bikes-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Shift-Cycling-Culture-CAT-course-Trek-bikes-768x446.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Shift Cycling Culture)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of a cycling company’s environmental impact comes from its supply chain. In fact, 95% of carbon emissions occur during the extraction, sourcing, and production of bicycle materials and components. To help tackle these challenges, companies have been working together to co-develop a Climate Action Training Course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The online training is custom-tailored for suppliers of cycling hard goods. It’s available in English, Mandarin, and Vietnamese (from mid-November onwards). The program is targeted at top management as well as technical mid-management. The free course is designed to help raise awareness about the “crucial role manufacturing sites play in reducing emissions and to equip them with helpful resources.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some Touch Points of the Training Course</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Training provides: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Foundational knowledge of measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How to set reduction targets and monitor progress</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitor relevant case studies of potential solutions to drive down emissions</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Want to Get Involved?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the press release, “<em>This course is open to the entire cycling industry, and all brands are encouraged to use the training as a tool to support their own climate action efforts, as well as those of their business partners</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course is available as a free online, self-paced course, and as a tutor-guided option for groups.
