Ever since we started hearing about it, reports have pegged the MSRP at $3,000 or higher, which would make it one of the most expensive non-Mac devices in Apple’s history. However, a new report suggests that while it wont be cheap, the actual price might be significantly lower than reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://xrdailynews.com/en/apple-vr-ar-headset-bill-of-materials-is-1500/&amp;xcust=1-1-1923318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">XRDailyNews</a>, Apple’s headset will cost approximately $1,500 to manufacture, which includes several high-end components that are more than $150 each. The total cost was corroborated by multiple supply-chain sources in China, though the site notes that some terms “might not directly correspond to their conventional meanings.”</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Dual M2 processors: <strong>$120-$140</strong></li><li>Two micro OLED screens: <strong>$280-$320</strong></li><li>14 cameras: <strong>$160</strong></li><li>Optical-mechanical lens system and assembly: <strong>$70-$80</strong></li><li>Rearview mirror: <strong>$13-$15</strong></li><li>Pupillary distance adjustment module: <strong>$30-$35</strong></li><li>3D sensor part: <strong>$80-$90</strong></li><li>Metal middle frame: <strong>$95</strong></li><li>Appearance parts: <strong>$15-$20</strong></li><li>External battery pack: <strong>$22-$25</strong></li><li>Microphone: <strong>$21-$22</strong></li><li>Speakers: <strong>$16-$18</strong></li><li>PCB+FPC: <strong>$40-$45</strong></li><li>Storage: <strong>$40-$45</strong></li><li>WiFi/Bluetooth/etc.: <strong>$60-$70</strong></li><li>Cooling module: <strong>$70</strong></li><li>Auxiliary accessories: <strong>$30-$40</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Add it all up and you’ve got a total of around $1,500. Of course, the bill of material doesn’t represent the entire cost, which also includes production, shipping, distribution, and other factors, but it shows that the AR headset will be a very high-end device. By comparison, the manufacturing cost of the Meta Quest 2 is reportedly around $750.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s do some math. The iPhone 14 Pro Max costs Apple roughly $475 to make and sells for $1,100. Assuming a 40 percent gross margin, there are about $185 in added costs, which shouldn’t be much higher for the headset. But even if we tack on $250 per unit, that brings the total price to $1,750. If you factor in Apple’s 40 percent gross margins, that would bring the MSRP to right around $3,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a Bloomberg report this week claims Apple could sell the headset “at cost” and has even considered selling it at a loss to generate sales. That means the headset could come in as low as $1,999, which would practically seem like a bargain compared to the rumors of a $2,999 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should know in just a matter of weeks. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> kicks off on June 5, just two weeks from Monday.</p>\n\nApple</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"bab8c3abd910c103e83afc4310755f8bd766b062238723efb1127bc95fe960f6","category":"Apple"}
