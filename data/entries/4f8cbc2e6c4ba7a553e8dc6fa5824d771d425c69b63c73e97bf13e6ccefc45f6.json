{"title":"★ Now Apollo Faces the Cliff","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/now_apollo_faces_the_cliff","date":1688758577000,"content":"\n<p>When Twitter unceremoniously pulled the plug on third-party clients earlier this year, commercial Twitter clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific were left in a perilous position. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff\">I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Twitter’s kneecapping of third-party clients didn’t just mean that\ntheir <em>future</em> revenue was gone — it meant <em>revenue they’d\nalready collected</em> from App Store subscriptions would need to go\nback to customers in the form of prorated refunds for the\nremaining months on each and every user’s annual subscriptions.\nConsider the gut punch of losing your job — you stop earning\nincome. It’s brutal. Now imagine that the way it worked when you\nget fired or laid off is that you’re also suddenly on the hook to\npay back the last, say, 6 months of your income. That’s where\nTapbots and The Iconfactory are.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t recall a situation like this, with an ecosystem of\nthird-party clients collecting subscriptions and then having the\nfirst-party service yank the carpet out from under them — and\ntheir customers — with zero warning or sunset period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alas, this situation has become a recurring theme. Now it’s <a href=\"https://apolloapp.io/\">Apollo</a>, the exquisitely well-made Reddit client by Christian Selig. The situation is nearly identical: Apollo stopped working earlier this week, and Selig is on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in refunds to annual subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>Just as with Tweetbot and Twitterrific, if you’re a subscriber to Apollo, here’s what you can do to support Selig:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Reinstall Apollo if you’ve already deleted it; otherwise, make sure you’re running the latest version.</li>\n<li>Tap the “I Don’t Need a Refund” button.</li>\n<li>Feel good and go buy yourself a treat, knowing you helped a talented developer (and nice person).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here’s Selig, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/14nb5qs/today_is_apollo_for_reddits_last_day_and_i_just/\">in his goodbye post the Apollo subreddit</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It feels disingenuous on the surface to say “I want to thank all\nof you”, but in this case it’s demonstrably true. I’ve worked on\nthis app for over 9 years, and I’ve never felt burned out, I get\nsuch a crazy amount of energy and enjoyment out of building\nsomething so publicly alongside such an awesome community, and you\nseriously have no idea how easy product development is when your\nnorth star is just “listen to what people are saying”. [...]</p>\n\n<p>I’m really heartbroken with how this whole process unfolded, I\ntruly drank the Kool Aid talking to Reddit at the beginning that\nthis was something they were going into in good faith with the\ninterest of developers, moderators, and the community as a whole,\nbut as many people pointed out to me, it’s clear now that\nultimately wasn’t their intent. If they wanted something that\ncould work for everyone, they would have simply made an effort to\nlisten, instead of being dishonest, callous, and punitive in\npricing. I’m sorry to all the folks who, like me, lost Apollo\nabruptly as a result of this. I had so much more I wanted to do\nwith this app!</p>\n\n<p>But, legitimately, I really feel a sense of that “Don’t cry\nbecause it’s over, smile because it happened” right now. I\ngrew up so much developing Apollo, I met and learned from so\nmany incredible people, made lifelong friends, got to go to\nmultiple WWDCs and was even featured in a few, and I got to\nwork on a product and platform I absolutely loved for 9 years.\nThat’s an incredible run, and it’s hard to feel anything but\nthankful for that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition to the “I Don’t Need a Refund” button, the final release of Apollo has a bunch of bonus content, including a few dozen wallpapers and some treats for Selig’s other app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6443919232\">Pixel Pals</a>. I find Selig’s good spirits in the face of this debacle to be inspiring.
