{"title":"iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus Rumored to Feature Frosted Glass Like Pro Models","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/","date":1681752721000,"content":"The standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will be equipped with frosted back glass like existing Pro models, according to a <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/MC0NhnzSD\">Weibo post</a> last week from the same account that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">accurately leaked</a> that iPhone 14 models would be launching in Yellow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iPhone-15-Frosted-Glass-Emoji.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWith frosted glass, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus would look more similar to the Pro models. However, only the iPhone 15 Pro models are rumored to be getting a new titanium frame and even thinner bezels around the display, whereas the standard models are still expected to have an aluminum frame and the same bezel size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe rear glass panel on the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/15/iphone-14-removable-back-glass/\">officially removable</a> for the first time since the iPhone 4S, making internal repairs easier. It's unlikely that a switch to frosted glass would impact this design aspect.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's common for features and design elements that are initially exclusive to Pro models to trickle down to the lower-end iPhone models over the years. For example, OLED displays were only available on the Pro models until the iPhone 12 lineup, while the Dynamic Island is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/dynamic-island-all-iphone-15-models-rumor/\">expanded to the entire iPhone 15 lineup</a> this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the source of this rumor accurately leaked that the iPhone 14 would launch in Yellow a few months in advance, they do not have a long-term established track record, so there is no guarantee that their latest information will prove to be correct. Nevertheless, the source's accuracy in the past makes this rumor worth sharing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 15 lineup in September as usual.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/\">Setsuna Digital</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/\">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus Rumored to Feature Frosted Glass Like Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-plus-rumored-to-feature-frosted-glass-like-pro-models.2387054/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"09878e0d2a1222007fd286e59daded20d811dea535a6d836221364dc9dfc3bd7","category":"Apple"}
