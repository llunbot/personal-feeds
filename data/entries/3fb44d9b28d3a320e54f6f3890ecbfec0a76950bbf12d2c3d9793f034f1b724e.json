{"title":"The Apple silicon transition is complete with the M2 Ultra-powered Mac Pro","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1941691/m2-ultra-processor-mac-pro-studio.html","date":1686000843000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple today introduced the new M2 Ultra processor as it completed its Apple silicon transition with the launch of the new Mac Pro. As with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/621053/m1-ultra-deep-dive-performance-power-ultrafusion.html\">M1 Ultra</a>, it’s a very big chip that needs tremendous cooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, the Mac Pro has the same design as the previous model with a stainless-steel frame and “cheese grater” aesthetic. But inside, the Mac Pro is all new, with a 24-core CPU/76-core GPU M2 Ultra processor and twice the starting memory and storage as the Intel model. It’s configurable up to 192GB of RAM and has six open gen 4 expansion slots for audio/video, networking, and storage cards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, the Mac Pro doesn’t support user-upgradeable RAM or graphics. It has a starting price of $6,999, a thousand dollars more than the Intel model. However, this model has the performance of seven Afterburner cards built-in, an upgrade that previously added $2,000 to the cost of the machine at checkout.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"apple silicon Mac Pro specs and features\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac-pro-features-specs.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Pro has twice as many Thunderbolt ports as before, with six on the back and two on the top, as well as three USB-A ports, two HDMI 2.1 ports that support up to 8K resolution and up to 240Hz frame rates, two 10Gb Ethernet ports, and a high-impedance headphone jack. Like the Intel model, you can configure it with a set of wheels for an additional $400 at purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also getting an update is the Mac Studio, which received its first refresh since its 2002 debut. It now includes an <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1475273/apple-announces-new-macbook-pro-m2-pro-max.html\">M2 Max or M2 Ultra processor</a> with Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1 for the same $1,999/£2099 starting price. the machine has the same design as before, with front-facing ports and a Mac mini-like footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced that the new Mac Studio and Mac Pro are <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-1941691-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-pro/tower#\">available for preorder today</a> with shipping beginning next Tuesday, June 13.</p>\n\nMac Pro</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3fb44d9b28d3a320e54f6f3890ecbfec0a76950bbf12d2c3d9793f034f1b724e","category":"Apple"}
