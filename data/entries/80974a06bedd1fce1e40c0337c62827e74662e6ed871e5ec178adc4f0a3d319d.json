Today, Google Maps has a gray background for land and white roads, but this new version has a nearly white background for land and darker gray roads, just like Apple Maps. This one change makes a lot of sense: Gray is a lot closer to the actual color of a road, and the darker color lets roads stand out more on the map. Pretty much every color has been tweaked, though—the blue water is much lighter. The green forest is darker. Major highways, instead of being bright yellow, are now a darker gray than the normal roads.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-980x717.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1.jpg\"></a> (credit: 9to5Google)</p></div>\n<p>Navigation mode picks up the new color scheme, too, with a darker green for the header and a dark blue for your current route. Previously, navigation was sort of themed around the Google logo colors, with Google Green for the header, red for a location pin, and blue, yellow, or red for the route, depending on traffic. The new design is a lot more muted.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965118#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965118&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"80974a06bedd1fce1e40c0337c62827e74662e6ed871e5ec178adc4f0a3d319d","category":"Tech"}
