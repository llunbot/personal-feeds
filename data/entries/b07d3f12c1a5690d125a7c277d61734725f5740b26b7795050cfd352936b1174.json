Man alive is it cold! There, I said it. Icy cold take from yours truly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s very good timing, then, that <em>Cyclist</em>‘s wisest and hardiest kit testing sages have been ploughing frosty furrows through the bitter badlands of the UK, checking which bib tights, jerseys, gloves and whatnot will keep your limbs and digits intact while you pursue your favourite pastime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy Turner’s wooden outhouse has been getting routinely dazzled by the camera, with these <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/santini-cargo-bib-tights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Santini </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/isadore-signature-thermal-tights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Isadore </a>leggings scoring particularly well in his cold-weather bib testing. While Paul Norman has opted for a Cotswoldian backdrop as he weighs up the pros and cons of the best long-sleeve jerseys in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-long-sleeve-cycling-jerseys\" target=\"_blank\">our buyer’s guide</a>. Katherine Moore is more (sorry) handy than those two, so it made sense for her to decide on the haves and the have nots in our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">winter cycling gloves buyer’s guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of the inclemency, there have been some nuggets of news to warm the tech cockles this past week. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/colnago-steel-bike-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago has launched a very bling limited edition steel bike </a>that’s less audax than it is St Moritz and will set you back about 40 years’ worth of Christmas presents. Speaking of audax-adjacent goods, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/dt-swiss-dynamo\" target=\"_blank\">DT Swiss has tossed its cap into the gravel dynamo market</a>, releasing some dynamo wheels that promise easy setup, compatibility and can be bought as either full wheelsets or separate hubs. Plus there’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pinarello-f1\" target=\"_blank\">a newly launched Pinarello </a>far more competitively priced than its fancy siblings, and some <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/argonaut-supernaut\" target=\"_blank\">new permanent members in the Argonaut range</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must be wondering what’s happened to Robyn and Ewan. No, we haven’t sent them to a high-altitude training camp to prepare them for the new season or frozen them in the basement. Robyn’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-lizzie-deignan-retirement\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Log</a> stokes up the remaining embers of the pro season, while Ewan, icicles forming on his beard, has proposed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/7-pro-cycling-things-that-should-be-left-in-2024\" target=\"_blank\">a few things the pro tour could and should leave behind in 2024</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And before I slide glacially down into the drops, if it’s bargains you’re after, check out the best of Black Friday via our articles on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/balfes-bikes-black-friday-deals-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Balfe’s Bikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/decathlon-black-friday-deals-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-deals\" target=\"_blank\">the best Black Friday</a> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-deals\">deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Ortlieb seatpost bag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5331-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My previous seatpost bag saw some pretty brutal treatment over the years and, for the most part, performed admirably despite not being fully waterproof. It strutted around with an atmosphere of superiority to water-ingress, but when it came to squeaky bum time – or wet bum time – your stuff ended up getting wet. Also, persistent rubbing on the seatpost eventually tore a hole in the fabric, which I’m yet to ask the company to repair for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the Ortlieb Seat-Pack QR (quick release) with answers to both problems. Its tender underbelly is protected by a robust plastic panel that functions as both an ersatz mudguard and protection against any rogue wheel rub. The material has a waterproof rating of IP64, which, while not fully waterproof, is plenty good enough for heavy downpours and constant splashing. Just don’t go lobbing your bag in a loch and expect your laptop to be fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5327-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ortlieb has also included a patented Seat-Lock attachment so that the bag is mounted directly, and securely, onto the seatpost, meaning none of the bag’s material layer is ever exposed to friction while riding. A couple of hooks clamp onto the rails of your saddle to finalise the fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In raw numbers, the QR itself weighs a decent 625g and has a 13L capacity with a maximum recommended load of 5kg. Plenty, when all I’m usually packing is an assortment of super-light down, tabasco and chamois cream.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/IMG_5323-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of straps and attachment points to hook onto and cable tie things to when your packing gets a bit haywire, while the compression straps should help you to make the best use of the space you do have – even if it is by brute force. Also, there’s an ingenious little pop-out valve that means you can squeeze all the air out of the bag before tightening it up as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://valleyandpeak.co.uk/products/ortlieb-seat-pack-qr-quick-release?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA_qG5BhDTARIsAA0UHSLDq7xOv2ktZeogik3_lPTubXpoZtkM5e7HtBloh7e2acKmtObRf_gaAn4xEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">Valley and Peak (£168.50)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-lizzie-deignan-retirement\">Pro Log: Lizzie Deignan announces retirement;

These little puppies make the impossible possible. With just a USB cable and a powerbank, no matter how rugged the wilderness, you can keep your navigation, tracking, lights, headphones, glove heaters, microwave, phone and goodness knows what else running. (The Nitecore even charges my laptop, which is certainly not common.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be dramatic, but it could be the difference between life and death – or at least life and life without a functioning pair of headphones during a long, dark night of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously a clunky old powerbank just isn’t going to cut it when weight is a consideration. As Christopher Wallace once said, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/drillium-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">drillium</a> and powerbanks just don’t mix, so put your DeWalt away and get an eyeful of the Nitecore NB20000 Gen3 Powerbank, an especially light contender that’s made from a carbon fibre solidified polymer and thus weighs just 291 grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/powerbank2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who has ridden a frame with a raw carbon finish, the Nitecore is finished in the same fashion, with a smart interlocking carbon weave. Nitecore says this forms part of its anti-torsion structure that makes it more resistant to vertical and horizontal impacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>20,000 sounds like a big number but what does that really mean? Well, Nitecore says its lithium ion battery will charge an iPhone 5.5 times and functions between -10° and +40°C, with a decent IPX5 weatherproof rating as well as two charging ports. It has two different functions for low and high output devices and Nitecore claims it will never overheat or short-circuit. Plus, you don’t need to worry about the journey to the start line, as its wattage is low enough to be carried as hand luggage on a plane.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://nitecore.co.uk/products/nitecore-nb20000-gen-3-power-bank.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nitecore (£104.95)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sealskinz clothing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/SS-fleece-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m in the fortunate position where my commute is less than 30 minutes door to door, via this nifty little contraption called a bike.

If it’s just moderately rubbish outside, I can get away with fabrics that will shrug off showers and focus on drying out quickly once I’ve arrived, not to mention look reasonably presentable and non-bikey once I’m tapping pearls of prose into the laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Sealskinz ensemble is pretty much ideal for the job. The Geldeston fleece comes in navy or olive, and is both warm and very quick drying, in spite of its cosy fabric.

The cotton is blended with stretchy elastane and Tencel, a fabric that has some decent environmental credentials, and is both breathable and moisture wicking.

Don’t worry about me: save yourselves people, the horse has officially bolted from this sun-scorched stable. There are hides of mountain ibexes in better shape than the wizened old skin bag I’m carrying around in place of a face, but that doesn’t prevent me from slapping on the factor 50 come rain or shine, summer or winter. And that’s where Lifejacket comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There comes a point in life where you start feeling guilty about piggybacking on your partner’s expensive skincare routine. I have reached that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifejacket specialises in products for those who spend lots of time outdoors – including cyclists – and has a product for most eventualities. I’m particularly enjoying the Daily Repair moisturiser, which is intended for end-of-day use as it doesn’t contain SPF (there is also an SPF version), but is also handy after shaving and just generally when you’re feeling husk-like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works to soothe damaged and dry skin and purports to be non-greasy and hydrating. I can confirm the former is certainly true. Interestingly, it contains something called carnosine technology, which protects skin from infrared radiation. Can’t say I’ve been worrying about that very much but now I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/Lifejacket-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other highlights are the Mineral Sun Stick, a 50+ SPF stick that is water resistant and protects your face and lips when out riding, and the equivalent 50+ spray, which has an oily consistency that dries quickly and doesn’t leave any sticky residue. Lifejacket says the fact that it doesn’t contain any water at all, means it is more durable and protects the skin for longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the ultra distance bods, there is an anti-chafe bar containing coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax and jojoba, that Lifejacket says is good for protecting the skin from friction, and restoring it after the damage is done. The founders of Lifejacket were inspired by several of their friends, who contracted skin cancer while in their 30s. Raising awareness of this threat is the company’s main message – so however, you go about it, make sure you’re covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://lifejacketskin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lifejacket (from £16)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: <em>The Day of the Jackal</em></h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"788\" height=\"516\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/image.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/image.png 788w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/image-300x196.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/image-768x503.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/image-750x491.png 750w\" /><figcaption><em>It’s story time with mummy</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s no two ways about it: it’s grim out there.
