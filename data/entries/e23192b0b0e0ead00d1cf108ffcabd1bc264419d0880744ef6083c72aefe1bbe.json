However, he said Apple is not actively developing such a device at this time, so it is unclear if it will ever be released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said the ring could be a lower-cost alternative to the Apple Watch that could sync health and fitness data with a paired iPhone. It would compete with products like the <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/\">Oura Ring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-ring-allegedly-in-development/\">Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Ring</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Smart Glasses</h2>\r<br />\nIt has long been rumored that Apple eventually hopes to release advanced AR glasses based on its Vision Pro headset. In the meantime, Gurman said the company has considered developing a \"less ambitious\" pair of smart glasses that would compete with the likes of Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Amazon's Echo Frames.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has discussed creating glasses that would serve as an \"AirPods replacement,\" with built-in speakers, cameras, health sensors, and AI capabilities, according to Gurman. The glasses are in a \"technology investigation\" stage within Apple's hardware engineering division, he said, so it sounds like a release is still far off. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPods With Cameras</h2>\r<br />\nApple engineers last year started exploring how to fit low-resolution camera sensors into AirPods, according to Gurman. If ever released, he believes these AirPods could offer AI features that \"assist people in their daily routines.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/apple-has-explored-smart-ring-and-glasses/\">Apple Has 'Explored' a Smart Ring, Glasses, and AirPods With Cameras</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-explored-a-smart-ring-glasses-and-airpods-with-cameras.2420380/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e23192b0b0e0ead00d1cf108ffcabd1bc264419d0880744ef6083c72aefe1bbe","category":"Apple"}
