This episode is packed full with insight, particularly on the importance of emotional intelligence both in a professional sense but also in everyday life and the reasons why some people are so chatty before an event while others are as quiet as a mouse. Dr Perry also shares how to find that all-important balance between pushing yourself hard and pushing yourself over the limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few curveballs too, including her reasoning for why she thinks not every cycling team should have a sports psychologist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview starts at 4:09.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/dr-josie-perry\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 78 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/orla-chennaoui-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 77: Orla Chennaoui, the face of pro cycling</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pippa-york-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 76: Polka dot jersey winner Pippa York on finding happiness</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/will-butler-adams-brompton-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 75: Brompton CEO, Will Butler-Adams</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p><em>This episode is brought to you by GCN+, the home of live bike racing.

When stored carbs are depleted, your body starts to convert fat into ketones. Studies show that ketones are 28% more efficient than glucose, making them a super-efficient fuel source for the brain and the body.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These benefits led H.V.M.N to create Ketone-IQ: a drinkable ketone designed to support energy, focus and endurance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Developed alongside the U.S. military, Ketone-IQ is one of the most powerful ketone supplements on the market. It’s designed to elevate your ketone levels for up to 4 hours – much longer than other products. Plus, it’s vegan, caffeine free, and compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s guidelines. That’s a major win for athletes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ketone-IQ Shots are the best way to get your ketones on the go. They’re portable, convenient, and fit perfectly in your pocket during a ride or a race.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can save 20% on Ketone-IQ using the promo code CYCLIST at <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?\" target=\"_blank\">https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about achieving your ultimate metabolic potential, subscribe to H.V.M.N’s podcast “Health Via Modern Nutrition with Dr. Latt Mansor” on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube.
