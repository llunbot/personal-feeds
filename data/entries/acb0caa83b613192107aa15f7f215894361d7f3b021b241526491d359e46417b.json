The side lugs are a bit wide and flat to really claw in if you lean over hard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/mountain-bike-tyres/schwalbe-nobby-nic-evo-super-trail-addix-soft-review/\">Read our full Schwalbe Nobby Nic Evo Super Trail Addix Soft review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h4>Tioga Edge-22</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tioga Edge-22 mountain bike tyre\" title=\"Tioga Edge-22 mountain bike tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s no denying how much predictable traction was on offer, especially when pushed hard.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£64.99 / $65 / €77.95 as tested</li>\n<li>905g claimed weight</li>\n<li>27.5×2.5in tested</li>\n<li>Predictable cornering</li>\n<li>Best as a front tyre</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another tyre with excellent cornering predictability, the Tioga Edge-22 is lightweight and easy to control.

We bring you the lowdown on what to look for when buying new mountain bike tyres.</p>\n<h3>What to look for when buying mountain bike tyres</h3>\n<p>You can’t overstate the importance of a good set of tyres. They drastically affect how your bike rides, so skimping is a false economy. Finding the best tyres for your needs is far from straightforward though.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclist in red top riding the Canyon Spectral 125 CF 7 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Canyon Spectral 125 CF 7 - 21\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Although the range of tyres on the market may at first seem overwhelming, it’s never been easier to buy a set of tyres that are suitable for your preferred style of riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Width</h3>\n<p>Width is crucial. Wider tyres roll faster over soft or bumpy terrain – in timed tests we’ve consistently ridden DH tracks faster on them – so many brands now offer 2.6in options. But a fatter tyre won’t suit everyone, because they can have a bouncy ride feel and won’t fit all frames.</p>\n<h3>Tread</h3>\n<p>Tread pattern is a key consideration too. Tall, widely-spaced knobs are ideal for muddy or loose terrain, while shorter tread blocks tend to be faster – rolling and more predictable on hard surfaces.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist riding the Whyte E-180 RS v3 full suspension eMTB\" title=\"Whyte E-180 RS v3 - 15\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyres can make or break a bike’s ride quality.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Compounds</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Big Betty EVO Super Gravity Addix Soft mountain bike tyre\" title=\"Schwalbe Big Betty EVO Super Gravity Addix Soft 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Schwalbe tyre compounds can be identified by the coloured strip on the tread.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most MTB tyres are available in several rubber compounds.

Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mtb-tyre-carcass-construction/\">mountain bike tyre carcass construction</a> has all the detail.</p>\n<p>But in short, thicker carcasses are less likely to puncture. Due to stiffer sidewalls, they can usually be run at lower tyre pressures without the sidewall collapsing when cornering. They also provide more damping, so are less bouncy over bumps.</p>\n<p>Thinner casings roll faster, especially over bumpy ground, and transmit less feedback at a given pressure.</p>\n<h3>Front or rear</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist riding the Vitus Escarpe 29 CRX full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus Escarpe 29 CRX - 14\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Be aware that there are front- and rear-specific tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tyres are becoming increasingly specialised for the front or rear wheel.

The advantage is an airtight seal with or without a sealant liquid inside, and very stable, pinch puncture-resistant, low pressure performance.</p>\n<p>The downsides are that these tyres are more expensive and also heavier.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Peaty's Holeshot Biofibre tubeless sealant\" title=\"08.06.22.PIC © Andy Lloyd\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubeless sealant is required to seal any punctures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most mountain bike tyres on the market today use some sort of ‘tubeless compatible’ system. These tyres use a tubeless bead but require sealant in order to make them airtight. They also require rim tape to seal the spoke holes off.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this system is that it is lighter than a full UST system and offers the user a wide variety of tyre choices.</p>\n<p>The downside is that there is not an established standard between the various tyre and rim manufacturers, so some rim and tyre combinations work better than others. Even so, this is the most common tubeless option you’ll encounter.</p>\n<h3>Which are better, light or heavy mountain bike tyres?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Maxxis Minion DHF mountain bike tyre\" title=\"Orange Stage 6\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Minion DHF has great turning performance and is suited to most conditions until it gets really muddy and boggy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>Weight has a big effect on the agility and acceleration of your bike. Light tyres are much easier to spin up to speed, change direction with and even stop, so make sense for cross-country use.</p>\n<p>Heavier tyres are generally thicker, which means they resist punctures and pinch flats better and are less likely to flop and roll off at low pressures. Heavier tyres also increase the gyroscopic effect of the wheel, making the bike more stable on the ground or in the air.</p>\n<p>At the really heavy end, reinforced-carcass downhill tyres are designed to be run at low pressures without popping or tearing off the rim, and rely on the help of gravity to get their 1kg-plus weight moving.</p>\n<h3>What width mountain bike tyre should I use?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof Dissent 290 Comp\" title=\"Nukeproof Dissent 290 Comp\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Maxxis Assegai tyres were designed with input from Greg Minnaar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s a massive range of tyre widths available from 1.5in to 5in fat bike tyres.

This type of tread has more rolling resistance than a lower-profile, more tightly-spaced design though, and can squirm on harder surfaces.</p>\n<p>A tyre with a square-profile will have more edging grip but is harder to lurch into corners. Rounder tyres roll more easily into corners and slide in loose terrain more predictably. Edge grip isn’t as aggressive, though.</p>\n<p>It’s a slightly simplistic summary, but a tyre that grips well because of a sticky/softer rubber compound and tall square-edged knobs will have more drag than those that don’t. But within this generalisation there are some notable tyres that reduce drag with a slight sloping of tread patterns, multiple tread compounds or the use of a ‘fast’ carcass.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some tyres that have barely any tread actually bite as well as some mid-knob rubber.</p>\n<p>Some tyres use different compounds for the centre and edge tread blocks, to balance rolling resistance, grip and durability.</p>\n<p>All of this depends on your local terrain as well – a super chunky aggressive tyre won’t be as useful on the slick rock of Moab as a lower profile tyre.</p>\n<h3>Glossary</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shoulder:</strong> The edge tread that provides off-camber and cornering grip</li>\n<li><strong>Sidewall:</strong> The bare side of the tyre, between the tyre tread and rim bread. Double or ‘two ply’ on DH tyres for extra stability and pinch flat resistance; airtight on UST tyres for tubeless running</li>\n<li><strong>Damping:</strong> Ability of a tyre to absorb energy as it rolls over a bump. More damping means the tyre rebounds slower, giving a less bouncy ride with better grip and control but more rolling resistance</li>\n<li><strong>Bead:</strong> The steel wire or Kevlar cord at the base of the sidewall that locks into the rim lip to keep the tyre in place. Kevlar or Aramid fibre beads are lighter and let the tyre fold, but are more expensive and the tyre is more likely to detach from the rim if flatted</li>\n<li><strong>Carcass:</strong> The fabric body of the tyre made from overlapping nylon threads encased in rubber. A more supple carcass enables the tyre to deform around lumps for extra grip but is less stable at low pressures. A reinforced carcass is more protective and less wobbly at low pressures but heavier and less comfortable. Lighter carcasses are more likely to get punctures too</li>\n<li><strong>TPI:</strong> The number of threads per inch in the carcass. Tyres with more threads are generally higher quality with a more subtle feel, but companies such as Tioga use a smaller quantity of fatter threads</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-compound:</strong> Tyres that use different rubber compounds; dual compounds are normally harder in the centre or underneath for fast rolling and long life, but soft on the shoulders for cornering grip. Schwalbe and Maxxis now do triple-compound tyres too</li>\n<li><strong>Durometer:</strong> The softness rating of the rubber; 70 and above is hard, 60 medium and anything below 50 is soft. The softer the tyre, the stickier it is on rocks and so on, but the faster it will wear out</li>\n<li><strong>Ramps:</strong> Ramped tread blocks have a leading edge which is angled like a wedge to decrease rolling resistance</li>\n<li><strong>Sipes:</strong> Small grooves cut into tread blocks to allow them to splay out like a goat’s hoof. Siped tyres offer increased grip, especially on wet surfaces</li>\n<li><strong>Squirm:</strong> Lateral movement of a tyre as the sidewall or tread folds during hard cornering</li>\n</ul>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"acb0caa83b613192107aa15f7f215894361d7f3b021b241526491d359e46417b","category":"Cycling"}
