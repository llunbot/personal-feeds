It featured a built-in Universal Dock for iPods, providing a seamless integration that allowed users to charge their device while playing music. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith its capability to produce a wide frequency range and room-filling sound without distortion, the iPod Hi-Fi combined Jony Ive's minimalist design aesthetic and high-quality audio performance. Its versatility was further highlighted by the inclusion of an Apple Remote, and the option for AC or battery power, making it portable. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMany products in the iPod series achieved remarkable success, but the iPod Hi-Fi wasn't one of them. The device was praised for its big rich sound, bass response, and ease of use, but its high price was a turn-off for many Apple device users. Also, the connector prominently positioned atop the speaker unit exposed docked iPods to potential knocks and damage. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite its innovative features, the iPod Hi-Fi remained a niche product in Apple's lineup​​, and the combination iPod dock/speaker system never took off. Apple discontinued it on September 5, 2007, just 554 days after its launch.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/apple-ipod-hi-fi-launched-18-years-ago/\">Apple's iPod Hi-Fi Launched 18 Years Ago – and Lasted Just 554 Days</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-ipod-hi-fi-launched-18-years-ago-–-and-lasted-just-554-days.2420717/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7a7eb85671fb53d4fa966d3b76d68268c8dde91eff412608282edb93bc4f9e16","category":"Apple"}
