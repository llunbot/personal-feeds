This is one reason why Apple always stresses backing up your iPhone before installing iOS betas, as pre-release software can experience critical bugs and issues from time to time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>iOS 18.4 beta 1 is now unsigned for the following devices: <br /><br />iPhone 12 Pro<br />iPhone 12 Pro Max<br />iPhone 12 Mini<br />iPad 8 (Cellular)<br />iPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi and Cellular)<br />iPad Air 11-inch (M2) (Cellular)<br />iPad Air 13-inch (M2) (Cellular) <br /><br />(h/t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhinakg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dhinakg</a>) <a href=\"https://t.co/esVqZ13cdy\">https://t.co/esVqZ13cdy</a></p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1893411982558052818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nThere may have been other issues affecting some of the cellular iPad Air models in particular, rather than the boot loop problem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1893424382468313474\">pulled the first watchOS 11.4 beta</a> for Apple Watch Series 6 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple should eventually make iOS 18.4 and watchOS 11.4 betas available again for the affected devices, but it is unclear when that will happen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnfortunately, this is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-pulls-third-software-update-in-past-month/\">far from the first time</a> this has happened.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/ios-18-4-beta-pulled-for-iphone-12-and-more/\">iOS 18.4 Beta Now Unavailable Across Entire iPhone 12 Lineup and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-now-unavailable-across-entire-iphone-12-lineup-and-more.2450097/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7d80c475e7e3ba156db33077e778df01d77403858d900f7245461c894af11941","category":"Apple"}
