{"title":"The Best Mountain Bike Flat Pedals of 2023","link":"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/","date":1687548312000,"content":"<p><strong>As one of the contact points between you and your bike, pedals are a seemingly simple but critical component for stability and control.</strong> Like your grips or your saddle, pedals play an important role in how you feel on your bike – your feet will be on the pedals for nearly all of your riding time, so it is key to find the right flat pedals that work for you, your shoes, and your riding style. And, because most mid to high-end mountain bikes don’t come with pedals, you’ll need to find a pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good mountain bike flat pedal will help you feel confident by providing great traction, predictable mobility, and a supportive platform to ride on. A poor pedal choice can cause your feet to slip around, adding risk to every ride. While most pedals share the same basic design, there are many subtle differences that impact the feel. Small changes in the size, shape, and profile of the platform, or the type of pins and how they are patterned, can have large impacts on how well the pedals work for you and how safe you feel on the bike. Due to the wide range of aesthetics, colors, and platform types available, pedals are also a relatively low-cost way to customize your bike and add some personal flair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spent months testing a wide variety of the top pedals available across all price points and analyzing them based on the platform (size, shape, pin layout, aesthetics, and finish), traction/grip, mobility (repositioning the feet), serviceability, and weight. The right set of pedals for you depends on your foot size, the shoes you ride in, the terrain you ride on, and your riding style, but we’ve chosen our favorites overall and those that excel in specific ways like traction, mobility, innovation, and value based on these categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top recommendations are listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are all still worthy choices.

These beautifully machined pedals are offered in two size options, a variety of colors, and they managed to secure the top spot in our flat pedals test with consistently high performance across our performance metrics. They are also the most expensive pedals we tested, but we feel that price is justified given their exceptional balance of traction/foot mobility, thin profile, low weight, and easy serviceability. </p><p></p><p>The small version of the WaveForm we tested has a well-sized platform measured at 105.5 x 97.3mm (the large version is a claimed 115 x 105mm) that works great for those with smaller feet, along with a thin, maximum thickness of 14mm, platform. While not the top performer in terms of all-out grip, we found them to have above-average traction thanks to the dual concave profile and 11 pins per side, including two on the axle. Grip proved to be impressively predictable and consistent in all terrain while still allowing for easy foot mobility when needed. While secure enough at all times, they allow easier repositioning of the feet than grippier models. This balance of grip and mobility is what truly made the WaveForm stand out, and makes them a great option for those who value both attributes in a pedal.  </p><p></p><p>The WaveForm pedals are part of Wolf Tooth’s “Right to Repair” program and they boast a 5-year warranty, replacement parts are readily available, and they are easily serviceable. They provide detailed service instructions and videos, and servicing our test pair only required a set of allen keys and about 10 minutes. Inside, three cartridge bearings help distribute the load, and the easy at-home service should help you keep them running smoothly for years to help ensure you get your money’s worth.</p><p></p><p>With solid traction and mobility, along with two platform sizes to get the right fit for your foot, the Waveform is a solid option that should work great for most riders. The $200 price tag is lofty, but the on-trail performance blending outright grip and mobility for a spectacular, balanced feel, combined with easy serviceability and readily available replacement parts, make the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fwolf-tooth-components-waveform-aluminum-pedals\">Wolf Tooth Waveform</a> a great option for riders who have committed to flat pedals and are looking for a high performing long term solution to move from bike to bike.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fwolf-tooth-components-waveform-aluminum-pedals\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FWolf-Tooth-Waveform-Pedals%3F_br_psugg_q%3Dwolf%2Btooth%2Bwaveform\">Check Price at Jenson USA</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth WaveForm mountain bike flat pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wolf_tooth-WaveForm.jpeg 1146w\" /></a><figcaption>The beautifully machined dual concave Wolf Tooth WaveForm pedals are available in two platform sizes and are our favorite model overall for their exceptionally balanced feel and well-rounded performance.

The average traction, above-average mobility, and easy serviceability make the OneUp Composite a great choice for any rider, and the $60 price tag makes them the best value among the models we tested.</p><p></p><p>The OneUp Composite pedals provide large 112 x 105 mm (measured) hexagonal platforms, the same as their Aluminum option and the same footprint size of the PNW Loam pedal. The platform features 10 rear-loading pins per side, with 9 around the perimeter and one towards the outside rear center of the axle. The platform is also grooved in the areas where pins are not present. The convex platform measured 18.6mm at the axle and a thin 13.2mm at the leading edge. The grip provided by the OneUp Composite pedals was average in the range of convex profiled pedals in our test, and while it does offer easy mobility, a concave profile provides more outright traction on faster, rougher terrain. The OneUp Composite pedals follow this idea – the convex profile makes it easy to unweight the edges of your foot to pivot on the central pin, and the lack of dead space between pins ensures grip in any position you land on.</p><p></p><p>Servicing the OneUp Composite is a breeze, with the only potential hang-up being the need for a longer 9mm socket head (or 8mm, depending on the age/version of your pedals) to reach the axle nut. Like with all their components, OneUp provides detailed service instructions and kits including all the parts on their website. Like most composite platforms, the pins use nuts to mount in the pedal rather than the tapped holes in metal platforms.</p><p>The nylon composite material feels solid, and while it is easier to scratch these pedals than their aluminum counterparts, because the material is the same color throughout rather than an anodized surface, they hide it well.</p><p></p><p>At $60 retail, the OneUp Composite pedals balance average grip, above-average mobility, easy serviceability, light weight (368g for the pair), and represent one of the best values in flat pedals available by exhibiting many of the same traits as their more expensive Aluminum counterpart. If you are a clipless rider who wants a pair of flats for occasional use, are not sure about switching to flats, have budget constraints, or just prefer a composite pedal body or affordable, quality components, the OneUp Composite should be your first choice.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-composite-pedal\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fpedals%2Foneup-components-composite\">Check Price at EVO</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"OneUp Components Composite mountain bike flat pedals action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Components-Composite-1.jpeg 1088w\" /></a><figcaption>Testing the best value OneUp Composite pedals in some wet spring conditions.

With an impressively thin, concave profile, a well-shaped platform, and solid grip in all conditions, the Altas is a great choice for most riders and styles of riding. </p><p></p><p>With one of the thinnest profiles (at max thickness) of just 12.5mm along with the chamfered leading edges and tapered outside edges, the Atlas reduces the chances of pedal strikes compared to thicker and squarer options. The shape of the pedal matches the soles of shoes very well and helps provide full perimeter contact with all the pedal pins for maximum grip. Bearing in mind that a size 7 US men’s shoe was used for testing, the average size platform could potentially be a bit on the small side for those with larger feet. The tall pins, 6.5mm on the leading and trailing edges and 5mm toward the axle, combine with the slightly concave profile to provide a very high level of grip at all times. The grip provided is right up there with the grippiest options we tested both while climbing and descending fast, rough terrain.</p><p></p><p>With tall pins and a concave profile, the grip provided by the Race Face Atlas doesn’t allow for the easiest foot mobility and repositioning requires deliberate lifts. While this is common on pedals with this much grip, it can result in your feet being locked into awkward positions at times. If you find the grip to be too much, Race Face includes pin washers that can be installed to decrease their height and increase foot mobility. Another consideration is the inboard bearing bulge. Many riders don’t get along with this feature on flat pedals, but it does provide a nice bumper for the edge of the foot while also helping to reduce the likelihood of crank rub. </p><p></p><p>Servicing the Atlas pedals is quite easy and requires only a 30mm socket to remove the endcap for inspection and greasing. Replacing bearings and bushings requires additional tools and a bearing kit, but the 6802 sealed cartridge bearing and IGUS bushing showed no signs of wear during our testing and are easy to clean and grease regularly to keep things running smoothly. Should you have any issues with your pedals, Race Face supports the Atlas with a lifetime warranty for added peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>With a smartly tapered, thin, and light platform providing high levels of traction, the Atlas pedal excels in the priorities for most riders. With average mobility and an easy process for light service, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F204939%2Frace-face-atlas-pedals\">Race Face Atlas</a> has no weak points to speak of and is a great performance choice, even at the high $180 price point. The lifetime warranty should help ease the price and the outstanding performance on trail make the Atlas a great option for all riders, particularly those looking for a thin concave option with very high traction.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F204939%2Frace-face-atlas-pedals\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frace-face-atlas-pedals\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Race Face Atlas flat pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Race-Face-Atlas.jpeg 1311w\" /></a><figcaption>The Race Face Atlas pedals have excellent grip for steep, technical climbs and rough, high-speed descents.

While they do require deliberate lifts to reposition the feet, the forgiving platform gives consistent, predictable grip performance in any position. With the high grip, easy-to-ride feel, and straightforward service, the OneUp Aluminum is a strong contender for anyone seeking a thin, lightweight aluminum pedal with a convex profile.</p><p></p><p>The usable platform size of the OneUp Aluminum measured 114.6 x 102.3mm, which is around the average for the pedals in our test and should accommodate most riders. With the large inboard bearing bulge, crank boot users should take note that the OneUp Aluminum may cause some fit issues, and may not be compatible. In terms of traction on the trail, the level of grip felt similar to the controlled float aboard the Wolf Tooth Waveform, our best overall pick, rather than the traction-focused feel of the Race Face Atlas. The convex profile and 10 tall, sharp pins provide enough grip, especially on rough terrain and during climbs, but not the pure “locked in” feel of the Atlas, possibly due to the convex profile allowing great grip in every position, rather than a concave “pocket” more sensitive to foot positioning while remaining slightly more forgiving from a foot mobility standpoint.</p><p></p><p>The thin profile of the OneUp pedals helps reduce the risk of pedal strikes, and the beveled edges on the outside edge further assist in deflecting impacts. In addition to the new pair for this review, a personal pair that’s been put through the wringer for the past 2.5 years shows marks from rock strikes limited to the outside edge of the platforms, where the extreme bevel has helped deflect impact, and the axle/bearing/bushings are still spinning very smoothly with literally no service. Speaking of, the Aluminum pedals are super easy to service and can be taken apart with a cassette tool to access the internals for cleaning and greasing. Bearing rebuild and pin replacement kits are inexpensive and available through OneUp.</p><p></p><p>With its forgiving nature, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-aluminum-pedal\">OneUp Aluminum</a> is a great choice for riders who don’t want to have to think much about foot placement, prefer a convex profile, or just want an overall great pedal that is easy to ride and maintain. The thin profile, average size, and strong, versatile performance of the OneUp Aluminum should work well for most riders, and, at its moderate price, the OneUp Aluminum is relatively affordable too.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-aluminum-pedal\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fpedals%2Foneup-components-aluminum%23image%3D166822%2F779869%2Foneup-components-aluminum-pedals-.jpg\">Check Price at EVO</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"OneUp Component Aluminum flat pedals action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aluminum.jpeg 1188w\" /></a><figcaption>The OneUp Components Aluminum pedals offer a well-rounded performance with a convex profile.

If traction, a locked-in feel, and a large platform are high on your list of priorities, the Dagga delivers in spades while still performing admirably across the board. Developed in collaboration with the legendary Chris Kovarik, these big, bad pedals are made for riding at fast speeds in hard-hitting terrain. </p><p></p><p>With a large footprint of 115 x 120mm and a measured usable platform of 115.4 x 110, the Dagga is one of the largest we tested (second only to the uniquely massive Pedaling Innovations Catalyst), the widest overall, and has the widest q-factor. The dual concave design tapers from 16mm at the leading/trailing edges to 14.2mm at the center of the axle and 15.4mm at the widest parts of the axle. Even with the larger dimensions, we found rock strikes to be less of a problem than expected, due likely to the reasonable maximum thickness of just 16mm. And, the platforms didn’t overlap the smaller size 7 men’s shoes excessively and the pin placement resulted in good contact with the soles.</p><p></p><p>The dual concave design and 12 well-placed 4mm tall pins on each side provide outstanding grip. Whether picking the way up a slow, technical climb, hurtling down rough terrain at speed, or slamming into compression, the grip is confidence-inspiring with a locked-in feel. Your feet won’t move unless you want them to. Surprisingly, repositioning the feet on the Dagga requires only an average amount of effort when compared to the other grip-focused models we tested. It still requires a deliberate effort, but is less challenging than the Deity TMAC or the HT Supreme, for example. Chromag also sells shorter pins should you wish to dial back the grip a bit.</p><p></p><p>A slight squeaking noise presented itself after the first few rides, but thankfully, servicing the Dagga is quick and easy with a set of allen keys and an 8mm socket. Plus, Chromag includes detailed instructions and a tutorial video to guide users through the process. A quick cleaning and greasing and the issue was quickly resolved.</p><p></p><p>If you’re seeking unflinching grip and a large platform for demanding DH, enduro, or super aggressive trail riding, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fchromag-dagga-pedals\">Chromag Dagga</a> stands out as our favorite model in the test. There are undoubtedly less expensive, lighter weight, and sleeker options on the market, but its exceptional grip and surprisingly well-rounded performance make the Dagga our top choice when grip is the priority. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fchromag-dagga-pedals\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FChromag-Chris-Kovarik-Dagga-Flat-Pedals%3F_br_psugg_q%3Dchromag%2Bdagga\">Check Price at Jenson USA</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Chromag Dagga mountain bike flat pedals action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-1.jpeg 1311w\" /></a><figcaption>The Chromag Dagga offer incredible grip and a locked-in feel for riding rough, technical terrain.

Unlike most of the other World Cup downhill and EWS enduro racers, Sam Hill has been winning on flat pedals for his entire career. So, it comes as little surprise that one of the grippiest pedals in this test is the <a href=\"https://us.nukeproof.com/products/horizon-pro-sam-hill-enduro-pedals\">Nukeproof Horizon Pro Sam Hill Enduro</a>. </p><p></p><p>These mid-sized octagonal pedals have a claimed footprint of 111 x 99mm and a measured usable platform of 100.5 x 99.3mm with a slightly concave design that dips about 0.7mm on each side between the leading and trailing edges. The moderate size of the Horizon Pro Enduro pedals worked very well with the smaller, men’s size 7 US, shoes used during testing, and the foot and pedal just always seemed to be in the right position. The maximum width of 17.4mm is slightly above average, but given the slightly narrower width and beveled leading and side edges, pedal strikes were no more of a problem than with most other models tested. </p><p></p><p>With 10 tall, thick pins evenly distributed around the perimeter of the Horizon Pro Enduro’s platform and a concave design, these pedals provided some of the most tenacious grip of all the models tested. While they are a touch less grippy than the class-leading Chromag Dagga, they seemed comparable to other high-grip options like the Race Face Atlas, Deity TMAC, and HT Supreme. The pin pattern and slight concavity seem to guide the foot into position, and once weighted, they have a locked-in feel that provides confidence in rough downhill sections or sprinting over bumpy terrain. Repositioning the feet takes a little effort, but certainly no more than other models with comparable levels of grip.</p><p></p><p>The service procedure is quite easy, and removing all the components, with the exception of the bushing, for basic service can be done with allen keys and an 8mm socket. They use a mix of backloading M4 x 10mm hex cap screw pins on the leading and trailing edges and top-loading M4 x 8mm socket head screw pins closer to the axle. The pins on the leading/trailing edges can be heightened to 6mm pin height by removing the 1mm washers that come installed on the pedal, but we never felt the need given the already impressive out-of-the-box grip.</p><p></p><p>If you are a trail or downhill rider who often finds themselves on fast and rough terrain and values outright traction and a precise feel, the <a href=\"https://us.nukeproof.com/products/horizon-pro-sam-hill-enduro-pedals\">Nukeproof Horizon Pro Sam Hill Enduro</a> pedals are for you.

At just $99 retail, they are also super affordable compared to most other alloy models. </p><p></p><p>The Loam pedals use a 6061 Aluminum body providing a 115.6 x 104.4mm convex platform, which tapers toward the outer edge and is relatively thin at 16mm thickness at the central axle and 10.3mm at the front and rear edges. The Loams aren’t the biggest or thickest pedal in the test, but for whatever reason, pedal strikes seemed a bit more common and they felt larger than the numbers suggest. The traction provided by the convex platform had a consistent feel, but was far from the “locked-in” character of the high-grip competition. Instead, they allow for easy foot mobility and foot “float” while providing trustworthy grip for most riding irrespective of foot positioning.</p><p></p><p>In PNW’s marketing materials, they state that the Loam pedal is built to provide “just enough grip to feel planted in sketchy terrain, but not so much that you can’t reposition your feet.” Based on our experience, it seems they accomplished this goal. They are grippy enough to provide confidence, yet subtle foot adjustments can be made predictably and with minimal effort. Both the convex profile and the ability to pivot off the forward central pin, located directly under the balls of the feet, seem to be at play here, yet the grip felt consistent wherever the foot ended up on the pedal. This combination of easy mobility and consistent grip made the Loam intuitive and quick to adapt to.</p><p></p><p>Basic service is a straightforward process that requires only a set of allen keys. The rear loading pins, however, could prove to be difficult to remove through the small access holes should they get bent. Still, with its extremely mobile feel and consistent, average traction in any position, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203387%2Fpnw-components-loam-pedals\">PNW Loam Alloy</a> do what they were designed to do and are our recommendation for those seeking a pedal that allows for easy foot repositioning. If you are coming from clipless pedals and missing rotational float, or just want a big, reliable, forgiving platform, the $99 PNW Loam provides solid overall performance and excellent mobility at a low price.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203387%2Fpnw-components-loam-pedals\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpnw-components-loam-pedals\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Loam Ally mountain bike flat pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PNW-Loam-Alloy.jpeg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>With large platforms and a convex profile, the PNW Loam Alloy allow for easy foot mobility with predictable and consistent, albeit not class-leading grip.

Created by James Wilson of MTB Strength Training Systems, the Catalyst’s design is intended to provide added stability, support, comfort, and efficiency with a massive platform that requires a different foot position than more traditionally shaped pedals. Pedaling Innovations provides lots of information to back up the science behind their claims as well as follow-up emails with helpful tips to make sure you’re getting along with the pedals after you purchase them.</p><p></p><p>The first thing you’ll notice about the Catalyst pedals is their massive rectangular platforms. At 143mm in length, and with 128.2mm of usable length, they are approximately 1.5cm longer than other models we tested. At 95mm wide and 16mm thick, they have otherwise fairly normal dimensions. The idea is to position the feet with the axle beneath the arch, with the goal of “recruiting” the hips which is said to increase power, efficiency, stability, and comfort compared to other designs. For most riders accustomed to placing the ball of the foot closer to the pedal’s axle, this position can take some getting used to, but that’s how the Catalyst are designed to be used and they can feel awkward and clumsy if you don’t.</p><p></p><p>Adapting to the foot position takes a few rides to become comfortable, but once you do, the advantages of the Catalyst become more apparent. While they don’t exactly feel as agile or precise for certain quick movements, they do provide loads of support and a confident, planted feel at speed through rough terrain or when weighting the bike through corners. After weeks of testing, the reduction of stress on the feet over extended descents is noticeable, and it would be easy to choose these pedals for a long day at the bike park or a high-mileage endurance ride.</p><p></p><p>With a whopping 18 pins per side, it came as a little bit of a surprise that their grip was only moderate on the first few rides. Thankfully, Pedaling Innovations supplies longer pins, and after swapping out eight on each side for longer ones, the desired level of grip was achieved. Adapting to the centered foot position also helped to improve grip over time. Still, repositioning the feet when needed never took too much effort, though the centered foot position does again take some getting used to with regards to mobility. </p><p></p><p>Manufactured by VP Components, the Catalyst pedals have a relatively standard design with an inboard bushing and two sealed cartridge bearings that are easy to remove and replace. Rebuild kits and replacement axles are only $10 each. A full bag of long pins is also included to fine-tune grip or use as replacements. The large platform does result in the Catalyst being the heaviest model we tested, though the performance gains claimed may outweigh the slight increase in weight. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://pedalinginnovations.com/product/black-catalyst-pedals/\">Pedaling Innovations Catalyst</a> is an interesting model with a unique design backed by research and science. While they take some getting used to, the comfort, stability, and control at speed and over rough terrain are noticeable.

The solid, locked-in feel and the high level of traction provides confidence and precision when firmly weighing the pedals, but unpredictable foot mobility in dynamic, slower-speed technical terrain was less impressive. With relatively low weight, a reasonably sized 100 x 100mm platform, great traction, and a $120 price tag, they are a good option for riders seeking the locked-in grip of a concave platform, provided they can find the sweet spot.</p><p></p><p>Outright traction on the Supreme was in line with some of the grippiest models we tested, but also more sensitive to foot positioning, and the traction felt compromised when not in the right spot. This may be due to the lack of pins on the inside edge of the platform, and when the feet weren’t perfectly centered the feel was quite different. This positional sensitivity wasn’t as apparent on other models in this test, so it is worth considering if your feet don’t always end up in the right spot.</p><p></p><p>Servicing the relatively lightweight, 375-gram, Supreme is a standard procedure, but HT does not provide service manuals on their website. The process requires a thin-walled 8mm socket to remove the axle nut, and thankfully, HT includes this tool with the pedals. The design also requires you to remove the bushing to remove the bearings, which makes it more difficult to ensure the pedal innards are clean and appropriately greased during quick services not requiring a bushing replacement. The bushing is a tight press fit and will require a tap or bolt to remove, meaning it will need to be replaced when doing so.</p><p></p><p>While the HT Supreme stood out in terms of overall traction, it didn’t rise to the top in a crowded field of quality pedal options.

Designed in collaboration with and named after legendary freeride mountain biker, Tyler McCaul, the TMAC pedals are made to handle big jumps, high speeds, and rough terrain. </p><p></p><p>The TMAC’s highly polished symmetrical platform measured 110.2 x 105.2mm and had the most concavity of any pedal in our test, at 2.15mm of drop per side from the leading/trailing edges to the axle. Most other concave options were about ½ of this level of concavity and you can certainly feel it on the TMAC. Fans of concave pedals should feel right at home. The concave profile and 14 thick, top-loading grub screw pins provide ample traction, one of the grippiest in the test, providing tons of confidence and a strong, locked-in feel. That said, the pronounced concavity of the TMAC’s profile made them feel more sensitive to fore-aft foot positioning than expected, and given the grip of the 14 pins, they aren’t the most forgiving in terms of foot repositioning. When positioned perfectly, however, the grip proved to be unwavering.</p><p></p><p>Weighing 448 grams for the pair, the TMAC is among the heaviest pedals in our test. This likely won’t matter much to the target audience, but worth noting if you concern yourself with pedal weight. Servicing the Deity TMAC is a fairly easy process, but it is worth noting that a standard 8mm socket was too thick to reach the axle nut, so a thin-walled socket, like the one included with the HT Supreme, is needed to remove it. The pins are top-loading and, though ours didn’t get damaged during the test period, will likely require some time with the vise grips to remove if the heads get smashed or bent. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221095%2Fdeity-tmac-pedals\">Deity TMAC</a> is a beautifully finished, highly concave option with standout traction that downhill riders, freeriders, and anyone who prioritizes outright grip and prefers a concave profile will love. While the Chromag Dagga may have taken home the grip crown in this round of testing, the Deity TMAC is another high-grip model that is very worthy of consideration.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221095%2Fdeity-tmac-pedals\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fdeity-components-tmac-pedals\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-pedal\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrankbrothers Stamp 7\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$180 (silver edition we tested: $190)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Usable Platform Size (L x W, measured)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Small (tested): 95.3 x 101.8mm, Large: 114 x 11mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness (Min/Max)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>11.0/13.4mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pins Per Side</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>10</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Profile</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Concave</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>353 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-pedal\">\n\n<img width=\"1368\" height=\"912\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrothers-Stamp-7.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Flat Pedals of 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrothers-Stamp-7.jpeg 1368w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrothers-Stamp-7-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrothers-Stamp-7-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrothers-Stamp-7-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrothers-Stamp-7-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrothers-Stamp-7-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightest pedal in our test</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2 sizes of platform available</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Average performance across platform and on trail categories</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Unique Service Process – you’ll love it or hate it</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Average on trail performance (traction and mobility) at a high price point</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-pedal\">Crankbrothers Stamp 7</a> is available in two sizes, large (114 x 111mm footprint) and small (100 x 100mm). Crankbrothers recommends the small size for shoe sizes 5-10 (US) / 37-43 (EU) while the large is intended for shoes size 10 (US) / 43 (EU) and up. While they have been making pedals for some time, Crankbrothers designed their Stamp flat pedal shoes with a sole tread intended to <em>Match</em> the pedal shape and pin layout of the Stamp pedals to work as a “system”. Though we didn’t test the pedals and shoes together, we will report back with more info when we do.  </p><p></p><p>The usable Stamp 7 small platform measured 95.3 x 101.8mm and features a concave profile with an 11mm thickness at the center of the axle and 13.4mm at the leading/trailing edges. The axle thickness ramps down to its low point slightly outside of the center of the pedal, where the inner diagonal bracing begins, and uses shorter pins by the axle, thereby increasing the concave feel. The slight bulge of the inboard bushing was occasionally noticeable, but otherwise, the shape, size, and feel of the platform was agreeable, especially for the men’s size 7 US shoes used during testing.</p><p></p><p>The traction provided by the Stamp 7 pedals seems pretty average. As such, they don’t inspire the most confidence when compared to similarly sized but much grippier models like the Wolf Tooth WaveForm or HT Supreme. When heavily weighted, the grip level seems quite acceptable, but they don’t provide a particularly sticky feel and it’s easy to accidentally pull a foot off during a technical climb, comparatively speaking. At the same time, finding the sweet spot and deliberately repositioning the feet seems to require a similar level of effort as pedals with more grip. The Stamp 7 pedals use two lengths of top-loading pins and they come with a full set of replacement full-length pins (bonus points). The shorter pins around the axle can be swapped out for the longer ones, which we found improved traction marginally during testing. Like all top-loading pins, they may be more difficult to remove if/when they are damaged.</p><p></p><p>Crankbrothers included a small grease port on the Stamp 7 pedals which should theoretically make it very easy to keep them spinning smoothly. A full service of the Stamp 7 only requires a 2.5mm allen key and a paper clip and it is easy to pull the axle assembly and two bushings from the body (no bearings here). Removing the bushings and inner seals for inspection gets a bit tedious with the split bushing on the inboard side with a very small surrounding seal and pushing the outside seal through the pedal axle with a paperclip. While service is quite accessible, we found that we preferred working on more traditional assemblies of other pedals we tested.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-pedal\">Crankbrothers Stamp 7</a> is a lightweight, 353g size small, and reasonably well-performing pedal that comes in two size options. Yet, at the fairly high price point, the average on-trail performance didn’t stand out compared to other similar or lower-priced options in this test. Again, we will update this review with info after testing them with the Stamp flat pedal shoes.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-pedal\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fpedals%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp%23image%3D113912%2F1010712%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-7-pedals-.jpg\">Check Price at EVO</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221094%2Fdeity-deftrap-pedals\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDeity DefTrap\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$55</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Usable Platform Size (L x W, measured)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>112.7 x 103.3mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness (Min/Max)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>18/20.4mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pins Per Side</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>10 (8 metal, 2 fixed composite studs)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Profile</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Concave</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>400 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221094%2Fdeity-deftrap-pedals\">\n\n<img width=\"668\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-DefTrap.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Flat Pedals of 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-DefTrap.jpeg 668w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-DefTrap-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-DefTrap-120x80.jpeg 120w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Larger platform</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Average performance across all categories</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Very affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Very basic design and aesthetics</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No outstanding features or performance differentiators</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Some composite pins that cannot be replaced</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>At $55, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221094%2Fdeity-deftrap-pedals\">Deity DefTrap</a> is the most affordable option we tested, coming in at $5 less than its composite competitor from OneUp. The Deftrap is a basic and accessible option with average performance on and off the trail, but its moderate weight, 4 non-replaceable pins, and average mobility traits kept it from taking our best-value award.</p><p></p><p>The Deftrap uses a fairly large, flat, and symmetrical 112.7 x 103.3mm platform with a relatively standard 10 pins per side in a perimeter pattern, two of which are molded composite that cannot be removed (the inside center pins closest to the axle). While the platform looks very basic and was the thickest in the test, it was easy to find and provided good support. Pedal strikes did not occur more than usual on the thicker platform, but if you find yourself scraping obstacles frequently, you may appreciate the composite material’s tendency to slide over obstacles rather than hang up.</p><p></p><p>Traction and mobility were average on the Deftraps large, flat platform, and on-trail performance felt similar to the Crankbrothers Stamp 7 Small, a significantly smaller and more expensive option at $190. While weighted, the traction was good – but the composite pins provide less grip than their metal neighbors elsewhere on the pedal, which can lead to some uncontrolled floating on the roughest, fastest tracks or when the pedals were not weighted very heavily, particularly when climbing seated technical switchbacks. The level of grip felt fairly consistent regardless of foot position and, while the mobility was not as controlled as the convex OneUp Composite, repositioning was fairly easy. </p><p></p><p>Performing a basic service on the Deftrap is a standard affair and requires only a 6mm Allen key and a 9mm standard socket. Two sealed cartridge bearings at the end of the axle should help distribute loading and increase durability. The pins that are replaceable are rear loading, a nice touch, and use a nut to mount to the pedal in the same way as other composite pedals. Again, the two composite pins, inboard by the axle, are not replaceable. Replacement spindles, bearing/bushing kits, and pins, however, are readily available from Deity and are super affordable too.</p><p></p><p>Does the on-trail performance of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221094%2Fdeity-deftrap-pedals\">Deity Deftrap</a> justify the $55 price tag? Absolutely. While the Deftrap was not the highest performer in our test including expensive, high-end options, its performance was consistent, reliable, and satisfactory. It’s a basic design and didn’t have the mobility traits of the OneUp Composite or fully replaceable pins, but most riders looking for an affordable flat pedal will likely be pleased with the average performance and low cost of the Deftrap. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221094%2Fdeity-deftrap-pedals\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fdeity-components-deftrap-pedals\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.dmrbikes.com/Catalogue/Pedals/Vault-2/Vault-Midi-NEW\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDMR Vault Midi\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$130</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Usable Platform Size (L x W, measured)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>94.6 x 104mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness (Min/Max)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>14.4/17mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pins Per Side</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>11</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Profile</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Dual Concave</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>425 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.dmrbikes.com/Catalogue/Pedals/Vault-2/Vault-Midi-NEW\">\n\n<img width=\"869\" height=\"579\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR_Vault-Midi.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Flat Pedals of 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR_Vault-Midi.jpeg 869w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR_Vault-Midi-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR_Vault-Midi-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR_Vault-Midi-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR_Vault-Midi-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR_Vault-Midi-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to reposition feet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smooth, controlled rotation around the axle</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sized down, dual concave platform for smaller feet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lower grip</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Average overall performance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dmrbikes.com/Catalogue/Pedals/Vault-2/Vault-Midi-NEW\">DMR Vault Midi</a> is a downsized version of the popular DMR Vault with a smaller 95 x 104mm platform, intended to provide a proportional fit for folks with smaller feet, or those who appreciate the smaller platform. Compared to the Vault, the Vault MIDI is 10mm shorter in length and only 1mm smaller in width and has the smallest footprint of all the models we tested. While the 105mm width is in line with most of the pedals in our test, the 95mm length is at least a ½ centimeter shorter than most, excluding the Crankbrothers Stamp 7 Small. The asymmetric octagonal platform tapers more dramatically towards the trailing edge, setting the stance slightly forward of the axle.</p><p></p><p>Eleven pins per side around the perimeter and 4mm pin height at the leading/trailing edges are fairly standard, but these pedals provided the least grip of all the models we tested. While you can flip the pins to fine-tune the grip of the pedal, the central pins cannot be extended (as there isn’t the necessary tool clearance) and the outer pins came installed in the longest position. We found the traction provided by the DMR Vault MIDI to be acceptable at slower speeds, on smoother terrain, and while climbing, but they did not provide a competitive level of grip when speeds got higher on more technical terrain. At higher speeds, the search for grip wasn’t particularly confidence inspiring, particularly over washboard root sections or in braking bumps. Shifting foot position, however, is quite easy as a result, and small adjustments are no problem. </p><p></p><p>Servicing the DMRs is a standard procedure but it is worth noting that they were the only pedal on which we lost any pins while testing. The DMR Vault MIDIs come with two replacement pins (in the long length) and losing a pin isn’t a big deal as it was easy to replace. That said, all of the top-rated pedals we tested came with Loctite applied to the pins to avoid this issue, while the DMR Vault MIDI did not.</p><p></p><p>With the lower grip, easy mobility, and a basic design, the Vault MIDI didn’t stand out in a crowded field of quality flat pedal competitors. Still, the <a href=\"https://www.dmrbikes.com/Catalogue/Pedals/Vault-2/Vault-Midi-NEW\">DMR Vault MIDI</a> may be suitable for riders who lean towards easy mobility and those with smaller feet may appreciate the short platform. The moderate price of $130 is attractive for an aluminum model, though we feel there are better values out there. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.dmrbikes.com/Catalogue/Pedals/Vault-2/Vault-Midi-NEW\">Check Price at DMR</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comparison Chart</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Pedal Model</th><th>MSRP</th><th>Measured Usable Platform Size (L x W)</th><th>Thickness (min/max)</th><th>Pins per side</th><th>Profile</th><th>Weight</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fwolf-tooth-components-waveform-aluminum-pedals\">Wolf Tooth WaveForm</a></td><td>$200</td><td>Small: 105.5 x 97.3mm, Large: 115 x 105mm</td><td>12.5/14mm</td><td>11</td><td>Dual Concave</td><td>377g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-composite-pedal\">OneUp Components Composite</a></td><td>$60</td><td>112 x 105mm</td><td>13.2/18.6mm</td><td>10</td><td>Convex</td><td>368g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F204939%2Frace-face-atlas-pedals\">Race Face Atlas</a></td><td>$180</td><td>111.3 x 106.3mm</td><td>11.8/12.5mm</td><td>10</td><td>Concave</td><td>381g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-aluminum-pedal\">OneUp Components Aluminum</a></td><td>$145</td><td>114.6 x 102.3mm</td><td>8.3/12mm</td><td>10</td><td>Convex</td><td>389g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fchromag-dagga-pedals\">Chromag Dagga</a></td><td>$172</td><td>115.4 x 109.7mm</td><td>14.2/16mm</td><td>12</td><td>Concave</td><td>496g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://us.nukeproof.com/products/horizon-pro-sam-hill-enduro-pedals\">Nukeproof Horizon Pro Enduro</a></td><td>$136</td><td>100.5 x 99.3mm</td><td>16/17.4mm</td><td>10</td><td>Concave</td><td>424g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203387%2Fpnw-components-loam-pedals\">PNW Loam Alloy</a></td><td>$99</td><td>115.6 x 104.4mm</td><td>103/16mm</td><td>11</td><td>Convex</td><td>443g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://pedalinginnovations.com/product/black-catalyst-pedals/\">Pedaling Innovations Catalyst One</a></td><td>$150</td><td>128.2 x 95.2mm</td><td>16mm</td><td>18</td><td>Flat</td><td>524g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fht-components-ans10-pedals\">HT Supreme ANS10</a></td><td>$120</td><td>100.5 x 101mm</td><td>14.5/17.2mm</td><td>10</td><td>Concave</td><td>375g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221095%2Fdeity-tmac-pedals\">Deity TMAC</a></td><td>$180</td><td>110.2 x 105.2mm</td><td>14.5/18.8mm</td><td>14</td><td>Concave</td><td>448g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-pedal\">Crankbrothers Stamp 7</a></td><td>$180</td><td>Small: 95.3 x 101.8mm, Large: 114 x 111mm</td><td>11/13.4mm</td><td>10</td><td>Concave</td><td>353g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingflatpedals&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221094%2Fdeity-deftrap-pedals\">Deity DefTrap</a></td><td>$55</td><td>112.7 x 103.3mm</td><td>18/20.4mm</td><td>10</td><td>Concave</td><td>400g</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.dmrbikes.com/Catalogue/Pedals/Vault-2/Vault-Midi-NEW\">DMR Vault Midi</a></td><td>$130</td><td>94.6 x 104mm</td><td>14.4/17mm</td><td>11</td><td>Dual Concave</td><td>425g</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Should You Trust Bikerumor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bikerumor, we’ve been reporting on the latest cycling news, technology, and products for over a decade.

For our buyer’s guides, we’ve sought out qualified individuals to test and review products side by side to form the basis for our comparisons and recommendations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mountain bike flat pedal review author, Paul Clauss, is a talented mountain biker who has been riding almost his entire life. Hailing from Essex Junction, VT, Paul has great access to quality, technical trail riding with ample roots and rocks that make for great flat pedal testing conditions. He is a mechanical engineer with experience working with 3D printing and CNC manufacturing processes on a variety of products including bike frames and components. This background gives him unique insight into bike components and technologies and an excellent ability to tease out the subtle performance differences between the products he tests. In this role, Paul gets to combine his discerning tastes and love for writing into detailed reviews that will hopefully help you find the best products for your needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After scouring the market for the best mountain bike flat pedals available in 2023, we rounded up a diverse selection of 13 models for side-by-side testing and comparison. Each model was tested in conditions ranging from wet to dry with equal parts climbing and descending. Often, models were swapped out mid-ride for back-to-back comparison. A pair of well-broken-in Five Ten Freerider Pro shoes was used with all of the pedals tested for consistency on Paul’s Santa Cruz Bronson and Chromag Wideangle hardtail mountain bikes. Each model was judged on a number of performance characteristics including platform, traction/grip, foot mobility, serviceability, and weight to determine our favorites. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing the best mountain bike flat pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HT-Supreme.jpeg 1311w\" /></a><figcaption>All of the pedals in this review were rigorously tested on a wide range of terrain and weather conditions.

Individual preferences and needs vary, of course, but thankfully so do the pedals we tested. As one of your key contact points on the bike, there are a few variables to consider to help select the best flat pedals for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Comparing a flat pedal's platform to the sole of a flat pedal shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Platform.jpeg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The size of flat pedal platforms vary, as do rider preferences and needs based often on shoe size. As you can see here, the Race Face Atlas’ shape matches up very well with the sole of this shoe. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Platform Size</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your shoe size and natural tendency towards in/out-toeing will contact various sizes and shapes of platforms differently. If you have very large feet, you will likely benefit from the support provided by a larger platform, while a smaller platform may work better for smaller-footed folks. If you like to hang your feet off the outside of the platform, pentagonal or rectangular shapes may give better support for the outside of your foot than a hexagonal shape. If your feet are sore after riding, consider how your foot engages the pedal when you are in your pedaling position on the bike and look for a size and shape that optimizes support throughout your foot. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedal-Platform-Size-Comparison.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"409\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedal-Platform-Size-Comparison-800x409.jpeg\" alt=\"Mountain bike flat pedal platform size comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedal-Platform-Size-Comparison-800x409.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedal-Platform-Size-Comparison-297x152.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedal-Platform-Size-Comparison-120x61.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedal-Platform-Size-Comparison-768x393.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedal-Platform-Size-Comparison.jpeg 1523w\" /></a><figcaption>Platform sizes vary between different models like the Pedaling Innovations Catalyst, Nukeproof Horizon Pro Enduro, and OneUp Aluminum (left to right) pictured above. Some brands also offer their pedal models in more than one size to fit different-sized feet more proportionally. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pedal Sizes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It stands to reason that people with smaller feet may not need the same size platform as those with larger feet, so some flat pedals are offered in different sizes with the goal of providing options for different foot sizes. Several brands, like Crankbrothers and Wolf Tooth, offer their pedals in both small and large sizes. For example, Crankbrothers recommends the small version of their Stamp 7 pedal for riders with shoe sizes between 5 and 10 US, and the large version for riders with shoes between 10 and 15 US. Wolf Tooth has a to-scale printable size comparison on their website, which riders can use to determine the best fit of the WaveForm pedals for their shoe’s soles. Other brands make numerous models that often have different size platforms for the same reason. Like anything else, it comes down to personal preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Chromag Dagga mountain bike flat pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Q-Factor.jpeg 1128w\" /></a><figcaption>Q-factor is the horizontal distance between the widest part of your cranks where the pedals attach. Some pedals, like the Chromag Dagga pictured here, have extra space between the cranks and platform that effectively increase the q-factor for a wider overall stance. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Q-factor</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also want to consider the q-factor. Q-factor refers to the width of your stance on the bike – technically it is the distance between the pedals at the outside of the cranks. Depending on how close the inner edge of the pedal platform sits in relation to the outside of the crankarm can change the effective q-factor in your normal riding position. If you have wide hips or tend to take a very wide stance, a wider q-factor may be more comfortable. If you ride bulky shoes or a frame with large chain stays or seat stays, a wider q-factor can help you reduce rubbing your foot on the cranks and frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-TMAC-Concavity.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-TMAC-Concavity-800x403.jpeg\" alt=\"Deity TMAC mountain bike flat pedals concave profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-TMAC-Concavity-800x403.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-TMAC-Concavity-297x150.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-TMAC-Concavity-120x60.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-TMAC-Concavity-768x387.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deity-TMAC-Concavity.jpeg 1342w\" /></a><figcaption>Many flat pedal riders prefer the feel of pedals with a concave profile.

Like anything else, preferences vary, but most riders prefer one or the other. Concave pedals are thicker at the leading and trailing edges and thinner along the axle. This creates a depression in the middle of the pedal for the sole of the shoe to sink into. Examples of concave pedals include the Deity TMAC, Chromag Dagga, Race Face Atlas, and Nukeproof Horizon Pro Enduro, which also happen to be some of the grippiest models we tested.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convex pedals are slightly thicker at the axle and thinner at the leading and trailing edges. This has the opposite effect of concavity, as it promotes the shoe’s sole flexing slightly over the pedal to achieve maximum grip. In general, we’ve found that the convex design allows for somewhat easier foot mobility, as the pins are easier to release from the sole of the shoe when repositioning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfectly flat profiles are somewhat rare, but the unique Pedaling Innovations Catalyst is an example. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Crankbrothers Stamp 7 mountain bike flat pedals pin layout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crankbrother-Stamp-7.jpeg 947w\" /></a><figcaption>In combination with the size, shape, and profile of a pedal, the pin layout, pin height, and pin type play a role in the grip that each model offers. The soles of your shoes also make a difference in the grip/traction equation. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Traction and Grip</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The traction provided by a pedal depends on the platform size/shape/profile, the pin layout, and the type of pins. Pin height and placement vary across pedals – some rely on pins placed around the perimeter, some include central pins. Some pedals allow you to adjust the pin height by adding or removing washers while others do not. The combination of these different platforms and layouts changes how much effort you need to spend keeping your feet on the pedals while riding rough terrain. The rubber compound and tread design of the soles of your shoes is also a factor when it comes to grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of traction you want from a pedal depends on your riding style and preferences. While a super grippy pedal might be great for riding fast downhill trails, it might be very sensitive to foot position and grip so well that it is difficult to reposition your foot – there are pedals that provide <em>too much</em> grip. The right amount of grip is individual to the terrain you ride and your riding style – if you find yourself struggling to reposition or rotate your feet regularly to feel like you are in the right spot on the pedals, you might want to try a pedal with a bit less overall grip but with a pin pattern, profile, and shape that allows for better mobility and is less sensitive to foot position. Riders coming from clipless pedals will want to pay special attention to rotational float if they are interested in a flat pedal that feels similar to clipping in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Chromag Dagga mountain bike flat pedals disassembled for basic service\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chromag-Dagga-Service.jpeg 1590w\" /></a><figcaption>Basic service, cleaning and greasing, is fairly straightforward for most modern pedals and can be done at home fairly easily. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Serviceability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any time you ride your bike, your pedals put in some serious work. Not only do they support much of your weight at virtually all times, but any time they are spinning, the internal components like bearings and bushings are doing their job. Given their location at the end of the crank arms, under your feet, and close to the ground, they may also be subjected to impacts with trailside obstacles. Hard impacts can damage pedal pins, scratch the pedal body, or even bend the spindles. Despite being a sealed system, water and dust from the trail can make their way into the internals. Of course, how often you ride, how you ride, the terrain where you ride, and the weather conditions in which you ride will play a role in how quickly wear and tear occurs on your pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Pedaling Innovations Catalyst mountain bike pedals pins\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pedaling-Innovations-Catalyst-2.jpeg 1373w\" /></a><figcaption>Many brands include extra pins with their pedals to replace damaged or lost pins, or in the case of the Pedaling Innovations Catalyst, pictured here, adjust the grip with longer pins. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, most quality flat pedals are designed to be serviced fairly easily to keep them running smoothly. Basic service procedures generally only involve a few simple tools to pull the spindle from the pedal body for simple cleaning and regreasing. Most brands sell bearing and bushing replacement kits and spindles so you can rebuild your pedals should something bend or wear out. Spare pins are often, but not always, included with new pedals so you can replace damaged ones or those that have fallen out, and replacement pin kits are inexpensive and typically easy to find.  Typically, you can find an instructional video to guide you through the process. That said, if you are unsure of your mechanic skills or don’t have the tools to do it yourself, most good bike shops can service your pedals for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite-800x533.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OneUp-Aluminum-vs-OneUp-Composite.jpeg 1190w\" /></a><figcaption>Visually, there is little difference between the OneUp Composite, $60 (top) and the OneUp Aluminum, $145 (bottom), but there are slight performance differences.

(photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to many other things in mountain biking, pedals are a relatively inexpensive component. And that’s a good thing since you can’t ride a bike without them. Still, the models we tested vary in price pretty dramatically from $55 up to $200. It will depend on how much you ride and how much abuse you put them through, but it’s fair to expect that a pair of pedals should last a couple seasons or longer if taken care of properly. Not surprisingly, the more expensive models are typically made from higher-quality materials and they generally offer higher overall performance than the least expensive options. If you ride every day and have specific performance expectations of your pedals, then it’s probably best to spring for a more expensive pair to meet your needs. If you ride less frequently, less aggressively, or simply can’t justify shelling out the big bucks for the high-end models, the less expensive composite options still perform admirably at a fraction of the price. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"DMR Vault Midi mountain bike flat pedals action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DMR-Vault-Midi.jpeg 1311w\" /></a><figcaption>Review author, Paul Clauss, testing the DMR Vault Midi pedals.

It really comes down to personal preference, and there are pros and cons to each style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flat pedals are often the first type of pedal that people ride when they start out mountain biking, and many riders choose to continue riding them as their skills progress for various reasons. Since the connection to the pedal is a result of the interface between the pedal platform, pins, and the sole of your shoes, it is much easier to remove/replace your foot on the pedal when needed. Modern pedal designs have large platforms that provide excellent stability and control and many shoe/pedal combos provide a nearly locked-in feel over rough terrain. Flat pedals also help riders build strong technique for bike handling, particularly with rear wheel lifts or bunny hops. The correct technique for these moves is not relying on using your feet to lift the pedals but using your entire body to move the bike. You’ll notice that most trials riders, freeriders, and dirt jumpers use flat pedals. This is partly due to technique, partly so they can adjust their foot position on the fly, and partly to mitigate risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clipless pedals, on the other hand, rely on a mechanical connection between the sole of your shoe and the pedal. This connection keeps your feet positioned optimally for pedaling and prevents your feet from getting bounced off the pedals in rough terrain. It is also claimed to be more efficient when pedaling, although some people will debate this, because the pedal connection means that you can use your leg power throughout the entire pedal stroke, both pushing down and pulling up. For this reason, you’ll notice that ALL road racers, and MOST mountain bike racers, use clipless pedals, particularly XC racers. For downhill or enduro racing, the argument towards clipless is likely less about pedaling efficiency and more about being locked into the bike on rough terrain – whether you are pedaling through it or not. There is a learning curve, however, as clipping out of clipless pedals requires a deliberate twisting of the foot. Often while learning to use them, awkward crashes and tip-overs are quite common. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Which pedals will give me the best grip?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>This is an individual preference and depends on your riding style. The level of grip you feel when riding flat pedals is impacted by: The shape, size, stiffness, and rubber compound on the sole of your riding shoes. The profile, size, and pin layout of the pedals – how does your shoe engage with the pedal platform? The height and diameter of the pins. In general, taller and narrower/sharper pins will give a more “locked in” feeling, particularly with more spacing between the pins – but this increase in pressure on individual pins can make repositioning your foot difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If possible, try a variety of shapes, profiles, and pin layouts with your favorite riding shoes to find what works best for you. Hop on your friends’ bikes and try to sprint over rough sections to test pedal grip with your shoes and foot positioning throughout your pedal stroke under high stress – this will ensure you are testing the vertical and lateral grip of your shoes on the pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, the grippiest pedals are those designed purely for gravity riding like the Deity TMAC, Chromag Dagga, and Nukeprood Horizon Pro. These pedals typically have long, sharp pins, concave profiles, and large platforms to optimize the connection to the sole of the shoe.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>What tools will I need to change my pedals?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>All the pedals in this test use either 6 or 8mm Allen (Hex) keys or a 15mm Spanner/Pedal Wrench. You will need the appropriate tool for your pedals and a small amount of general bicycle assembly grease.<br /><br />When installing pedals, remember that the left pedal is reverse threaded – turn counterclockwise into the crank arm to install. All the pedals in this test have clear markings to indicate their side. An easy way to remember this is that you always rotate pedals forward (towards the front of the bike) to install. Most pedals mark right and left pedals to help avoid installing them on the wrong side. If you are struggling to get the threads to catch, don’t force it or you can risk damaging the threads in your cranks arms. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>What maintenance is required for flat pedals?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Flat pedals are a simple part but do require simple, infrequent maintenance. Riding flat pedals, you can generally expect to replace pins to maintain traction and service bearings/axles to keep them spinning smoothly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some pedals use standard grub screws for pins that you can find at your local hardware store. Others use customized pins that you will need to order from the pedal manufacturer. If you find yourself smacking roots and rocks often, you may want to consider the ease of replacing pins when selecting pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing pins is easy – unscrew the old ones and screw in the new ones. Recessed or sunken pin heads can help you avoid needing to remove bent or damaged pins with vise grips and a good brush will help you remove dirt packed into pins. Some pedals come with replacement pins while others do not. Most pins use a small hex key (1 to 3mm) or a Torx head (T10 or T15) for removal/installation. We recommend using a small amount of thread locker when installing pins to ensure they don’t fall out, like Blue Loctite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your pedals are not rotating smoothly, it is time to service/replace the bearings/bushings and axle. For most pedals in this test, rebuild kits are sold by the manufacturers and instructions are typically very easy to find online. This is a relatively straightforward process of removing the pin, checking bearings/bushings, and cleaning/regreasing/repacking or replacing as necessary.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>What shoes do you recommend for use with flat pedals?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Any modern mountain bike flat pedal shoe will work well with these pedals. Flat pedal shoes are constructed with flat soles, grippy rubber, and tread patterns to optimize the grip provided by common pin patterns and pedal designs. When purchasing flat pedal shoes, consider normal sneaker fit and your preference for a stiff or soft sole. A stiffer sole might be more supportive and reduce foot pain on longer rides while a softer sole may give a better overall grip, particularly when looking for high control at slower speeds. Bear in mind that not all flat pedal shoes are created equal in terms of the grip that their rubber compound or tread pattern provides, and that may also affect your connection to the pedals.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Related Content</h3>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"mountain bike helmets\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Yakima StageTwo\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Hitch Bike Racks of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">The Best Mountain Bike Flat Pedals of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0653fa0e6e5fdbd3d0d52c6587aa74316eff5f0f83832f5fb4160da252b7d33c","category":"Cycling"}
