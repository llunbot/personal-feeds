Winter training and commuting are hard enough without worrying about fixing a flat with frozen fingers on a dark road.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there’s never been a better selection of winter road bike tyres, combining trustworthy all-weather performance with everyday reliability. To make your life easier, we’ve rounded up some of the best winter road tyres as rated by the BikeRadar testing team.</p>\n<p>The key to these real-world advances has been the combination of technologies from seemingly very different areas.</p>\n<p>Tyre compounds and layups developed for racing use in wet conditions deliver a balance of late braking, hard-turning grip and rolling speed.</p>\n<p>Puncture-protection technology has also moved on a great deal (we certainly don’t miss <a href=\"https://link.monetizer101.com/shop-rest/api/track/deeplink/608?sourceUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Panaracer-Flataway-Kevlar-Puncture-Protection_424.htm\" target=\"_blank\">puncture protection strips</a>) and is now achieved largely by multi-ply composites used originally in bulletproof vests. This means you can have a barrier between road debris and your inner tube without feeling like there’s wood in your tyres.</p>\n<p>While it may be tempting to pair your winter wheels with the heaviest-duty tyre you can handle lugging about, puncture-proof tyres really have got a lot better in recent years, so it’s worth delving into our longer reviews to see whether one may work for you.</p>\n<p>Tubeless tyre tech has taken off on the road too, giving you the advantage of some extra protection on winter roads. If you’re still frequently plagued by punctures, it may be worth investigating whether or not converting to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-set-up-road-tubeless-tyres/\">road tubeless tyres</a> could work for you.

Trying to balance extra protection but still allowing the tyre to be flexible and supple enough to roll quickly and comfortably is hard.</p>\n<p>Some tyres also include protective layers in the side walls to stop cuts, which is called bead-to-bead protection.

This means the inner tube (if using) is less likely to get pinched and punctured. Fatter tyres feel more comfortable, afford more control on rough surfaces and oodles of tests have shown they often roll better than narrower ones.</p>\n<p>The ability to drop the pressure in a wider tyre means you have a larger, more compliant contact patch for more grip too.

This is why many tyres have a dual compound that is harder in the centre than on the shoulders.</p>\n<p><strong>Gravel tyres:</strong> Another winter option that’s been opened up by the ever-increasing tyre clearance of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a> is to run gravel tyres. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">best gravel tyres</a> will add even more grip, but may roll almost as fast as a road bike tyre. Often, there’ll be a range of widths available and the narrower ones will fit in a road bike frame, giving you the grip you need to take on rougher, damper surfaces.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e06f0296efe7445a590ce4773e9908453c1b0c34d1a128f4b11d4dcd8aa8c628","category":"Cycling"}
