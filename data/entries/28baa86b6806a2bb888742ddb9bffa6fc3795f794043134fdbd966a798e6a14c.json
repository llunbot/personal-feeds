I’ve always associated the adventure sandal with hardcore thru-hiking, or professional dirtbaggery (I mean that in the best of ways). And if you would’ve asked me 10 years ago if I would ever ride my bike on flat pedals while wearing sandals, I would’ve asked if you were high. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, while looking for a different way to approach my cycling, getting bored with the same ol’ way of doing it … I tried it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairns-riding-South-Tahoe-e1678145058658.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"574\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairns-riding-South-Tahoe-e1678145058658-800x574.jpeg\" alt=\"Bedrock Sandals Cairns riding South Tahoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairns-riding-South-Tahoe-e1678145058658-800x574.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairns-riding-South-Tahoe-e1678145058658-297x213.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairns-riding-South-Tahoe-e1678145058658-120x86.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairns-riding-South-Tahoe-e1678145058658-768x551.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairns-riding-South-Tahoe-e1678145058658.jpeg 940w\" /></a><figcaption>Bedrock Cairns in South Tahoe.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m here to tell you, it’s a good time. I’ve been riding my bike exclusively with sandals for many years and on many, many different terrains, including during a torrential hail storm on the way to ride Mr. Toad’s in South Tahoe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first started my cycling-in-sandals adventures sometime in 2016, with a pair of Tevas. I can’t remember the model, it was the Hurricane somethin’ or other. But it’s not important because I didn’t like them much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After discovering the benefits of “zero drop” footwear, I looked to find another sandal to ride in. After some searching and review reading, I discovered <a href=\"https://bedrocksandals.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bedrock Sandals</a> in 2017. I’ve been wearing them nonstop ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hold on, what does “zero drop” mean? Zero drop simply refers to the angle of where your heel sits compared to your toes. Traditional footwear, like the Tevas I was wearing (as well as all of my other shoes), elevates the heel between a half and a full inch (14-24 mm). Some say that this misaligns the spine and causes an “unnatural heel strike.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zero-drop footwear keeps your piggies (toes) and heel level, mimicking the natural state the foot is in while barefooted and standing on a flat surface. Simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-riding-the-Haanjo.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-riding-the-Haanjo-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Bedrock Sandals riding the Haanjo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-riding-the-Haanjo-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-riding-the-Haanjo-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-riding-the-Haanjo-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-riding-the-Haanjo-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-riding-the-Haanjo.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-before-the-Re-Soul.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-before-the-Re-Soul-800x1067.jpeg\" alt=\"Bedrock Sandals before the Re-Soul\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-before-the-Re-Soul-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-before-the-Re-Soul-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-before-the-Re-Soul-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-before-the-Re-Soul-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-before-the-Re-Soul.jpeg 960w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairn-tan-line.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairn-tan-line-800x1067.jpeg\" alt=\"Bedrock Sandals Cairn tan line\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairn-tan-line-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairn-tan-line-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairn-tan-line-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairn-tan-line-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bedrock-Sandals-Cairn-tan-line.jpeg 960w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I went ahead and ordered a pair of Bedrock’s <a href=\"https://bedrocksandals.com/collections/all-sandals/products/cairn-sandals\" target=\"_blank\">Cairn Adventure Sandals</a>. I kinda fell for them right out of the box — I loved the way they looked and they were instantly comfortable. After wearing them for the first week, my feet felt great, and they felt light while walking. While outdoors, camping, and riding, they performed great. The aggressive tread held on to the pedals perfectly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up putting hundreds and hundreds of miles on my Cairns. But, when the weather got cold, I put them away for the winter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Bedrock announced the launch of its Mountain Clog, I thought “all right, now I can wear Bedrocks all winter long … with socks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bedrock Mountain Clogs: First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LargeBedrock-Mountian-Clogs-gray-synthetic.jpg\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LargeBedrock-Mountian-Clogs-gray-synthetic-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Bedrock Mountain Clogs gray synthetic\" /></a><figcaption>Bedrock Mountain Clog in the gray synthetic leather. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon the initial unboxing, I noticed that these <a href=\"https://bedrocksandals.com/collections/bedrock-mountain-clogs\" target=\"_blank\">new</a> Mountain Clogs ($160-175) are very similar to my Cairns. They have three adjustment areas, adjusting similarly to the Cairns, so I tried to match the settings of the Cairns and started wearing them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The side and heel daisy chain adjustments are adjusted just once when you get them on to find the right fit.
