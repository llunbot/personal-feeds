{"title":"Mastodon’s FAQ on Threads","link":"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/","date":1688687222000,"content":"\n<p>Eugen Rochko, founder and CEO of Mastodon:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today, Meta is launching its new microblogging platform called\nThreads. What is noteworthy about this launch is that Threads\nintends to become part of the decentralized social web by using\nthe same standard protocol as Mastodon, ActivityPub. There’s been\na lot of speculation around what Threads will be and what it means\nfor Mastodon. We’ve put together some of the most common questions\nand our responses based on what was launched today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What strikes me about this FAQ is that nearly every question has no basis in reality. It’s calming the irrational fears of people who view Facebook as a corporate bogeyman. Having <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open\">written</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/more_on_preemptively_blocking\">quite a bit</a> recently about Threads joining the open fediverse, I can vouch that these fears are real, insofar as people really do think Threads is somehow going to steal their data, or that Facebook is somehow going to show ads to people on Mastodon servers, but those fears have no more basis in reality than worrying about monsters who live under your bed.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the one that really matters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Will Meta embrace-extend-extinguish the ActivityPub protocol?</em></p>\n\n<p>There are comparisons to be made between Meta adopting ActivityPub\nfor its new social media platform and Meta adopting XMPP for its\nMessenger service a decade ago. There was a time when users of\nFacebook and users of Google Talk were able to chat with each\nother and with people from self-hosted XMPP servers, before each\nplatform was locked down into the silos we know today. What would\nstop that from repeating? Well, even if Threads abandoned\nActivityPub down the line, where we would end up is exactly where\nwe are now. XMPP did not exist on its own outside of nerd circles,\nwhile ActivityPub enjoys the support and brand recognition of\nMastodon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/mastodon-threads-faq\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"94c5bf8c3e70df1644a71e06ead657bd1f7337dd4836f0ce8897a5f81a04225e","category":"Tech"}
