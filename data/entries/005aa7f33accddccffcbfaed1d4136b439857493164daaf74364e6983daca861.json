{"title":"Dread Pirate Roberts escaped development hell: Making Silk Road work as a film","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769648","date":1627214458000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>Trailer for <em>Silk Road</em>. </p></div>\n<p>In the last decade or so of Ars, two pre-COVID news stories stand out to me as the \"biggest\"â€”the kind of stuff that captivates a general audience in the moment and will attract the eyes of Hollywood eventually. The first one happened back in 2013, when former <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/the-snowden-legacy-part-one-whats-changed-really/\">NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified documents</a> that showed the US had a secret surveillance program up and running that even monitored US citizens. To make the saga even juicier, Snowden ultimately <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/with-wikileaks-help-snowden-lands-in-moscow-headed-on-to-democratic-nation/\">had to flee the country</a> for fear of legal retribution.</p>\n<p>The second story largely unfolded in that same year. A young libertarian named <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/\">Ross Ulbricht</a> pondered why in the United States you couldn't purchase drugs freely and openly on the Internet through some kind of one-stop repository like Amazon. Eventually, his Silk Road website sprung up and captivated the world... until federal authorities finally closed in on Ulbricht in a San Francisco library in October 2013. The arrest led to an eye-opening trial and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/sunk-how-ross-ulbricht-ended-up-in-prison-for-life/\">a life sentence for the pseudonymous Dread Pirate Roberts</a>.</p>\n<p>Snowden's story ultimately got the Hollywood treatment, via the Oscar-winning documentary <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/secrets-become-history-edward-snowden-on-film-as-citizenfour/\"><em>Citizenfour</em></a> in 2014 and a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/snowden-sees-stone-return-to-war-film-relevance-thanks-mostly-to-gordon-levitt/\">fictionalized account starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a> two years later. And though it took a bit longer (unless we're counting a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web_(film)\">made-for-TV documentary</a>), the Silk Road odyssey has finally made its feature film debut, too.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769648#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769648&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"005aa7f33accddccffcbfaed1d4136b439857493164daaf74364e6983daca861","category":"Tech"}
