{"title":"2026 Porsches Still Won’t Have Next-Gen CarPlay, Which Was Announced in 2022","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay/","date":1743003702000,"content":"\n<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s next-generation CarPlay experience is still nowhere to be\nseen following <a href=\"https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-communication-management-change-of-the-model-year-38985.html\">Porsche’s announcement</a> of a major upgrade of\nits infotainment system for 2026.</p>\n\n<p>The upcoming 2026 model year Porsche Taycan, 911, Panamera, and\nCayenne feature an upgraded version of the Porsche Communication\nManagement (PCM) system, making it more responsive, adding Dolby\nAtmos support, and integrating Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. The\nnew system brings the Porsche App Center, a kind of app store for\nthe vehicle, to all of the new models.</p>\n\n<p>It continues to support the standard version of Apple CarPlay and\nAndroid Auto. Support for Apple’s next-generation CarPlay\nexperience is again conspicuously missing from Porsche’s new\nlineup, and the automaker did not mention it at all during its\nlatest announcement — another bleak sign for the delayed feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d crack a joke about it looking less and less likely that next-gen CarPlay was going to appear in 2024, but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/apple-carplay-2024\">I already did that in January</a>, when Apple itself took the date off <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/\">its CarPlay page</a>. That announcement <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-carplay-could-revolutionize-your-cars-interface-in-2023\">came at WWDC 2022</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In this case (unlike the advanced personalized features of Apple Intelligence) it was actually sensible for Apple to pre-announce the existence of next-gen CarPlay, given the reliance on third parties. But it also should have been clear just how incredibly hard it would be to get third party carmakers up to snuff on being able to ship it, so Apple giving a date, any date, was always odd. Apple doesn’t make a car, and you can’t promise what you can’t control. They should have just said “soon”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/26/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"57e42ce5a83df7b071044f34b58189d0b76d6e8067a059d3623de6263f277561","category":"Tech"}
