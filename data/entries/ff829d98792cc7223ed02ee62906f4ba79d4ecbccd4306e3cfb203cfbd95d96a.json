The tech giant claims that its latest Fire OS update is about security but has refused to detail any potential security concerns.</p>\n<p>Users and app developers have reported that numerous apps that used to work with Fire TV devices for years have suddenly stopped working. As first reported by <a href=\"https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/\">AFTVnews</a>, the update has made apps unable to establish local Android Debug Bridge (ADB) connections and execute ADB commands with Fire TV devices. The update, Fire OS 7.6.6.9, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201497590\">affects</a> several Fire OS-based TVs, including models from TCL, Toshiba, Hisense, and Amazon’s <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/amazons-self-branded-tvs-get-fancier-with-quantum-dots-local-dimming/\">Fire TV Omni QLED Series</a>. Other devices running the update include Amazon’s first Fire TV Stick 4K Max, the third-generation Fire TV Stick, as well as the third and second-generation Fire TV Cubes and the Fire TV Stick Lite.</p>\n<p>A code excerpt shared with <a href=\"https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/\">AFTVnews</a> by what the publication described as an “affected app developer,\" which you can view <a href=\"https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/amazons-change-to-fire-tv-adb-that-blocks-local-connections/\">here</a>, shows a line of code indicating that Fire TVs would not be allowed to make ADB connections with a local device or app. As pointed out by AFTVnews, such apps have been used by Fire TV modders for abilities like clearing installed apps’ cache and using a different home screen than the Fire OS default. Other uses include advanced tweaks, like console emulators, as <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/amazon-fire-tv-apps-adb/\">How-To Geek</a> noted.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006190#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006190&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff829d98792cc7223ed02ee62906f4ba79d4ecbccd4306e3cfb203cfbd95d96a","category":"Tech"}
