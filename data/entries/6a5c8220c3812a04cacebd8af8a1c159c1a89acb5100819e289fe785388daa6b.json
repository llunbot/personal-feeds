{"title":"How to find the Retouch tool in Photos for macOS Sequoia 15.1","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2516226/how-to-find-photos-retouch-tool-macos-sequoia-15-1.html","date":1732179600000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has offered a Retouch tool in the macOS Photos app for several releases. This brush-like tool lets you “paint” over an area or in spots and have Photos interpolate detail, removing noise and dust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in macOS 15.1 Sequoia, however, some readers who rely on Retouch noticed it disappeared. That’s because Apple added a more powerful but still in-progress replacement feature: Clean Up. Clean relies on Apple Intelligence, the company’s beta machine-learning product. You need an M1 or later Apple silicon Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re using an M-series Mac, when you double-click an image and click Edit, and click Adjust in the button at the top of the editing window, Retouch no longer appears in the right-hand adjustment list. Instead, a new Clean Up button is available at the top of the screen. Click that, and you can adjust a Size slider and click, circle, or paint an area on a photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clean Up seems to work best on small areas and in removing certain kinds of distractions, like power lines, people in the background of a photo, or objects. When I drag or circle larger areas instead of painting, the results are quite poor compared to the control offered in Retouch.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac911-retouch-clean-up-compared.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Photos Retouch\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac911-retouch-clean-up-compared.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac911-retouch-clean-up-compared.png?resize=300%2C148&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac911-retouch-clean-up-compared.png?resize=768%2C378&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac911-retouch-clean-up-compared.png?resize=1200%2C591&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac911-retouch-clean-up-compared.png?resize=1536%2C756&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac911-retouch-clean-up-compared.png?resize=2048%2C1009&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"591\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Retouch isn’t perfect, but it seems to smooth out dust from the top-right of an iPad mini without being too obstrusive (left).

Even if you disable Apple Intelligence in  <em>&gt; System Settings &gt; Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri</em>, Clean Up still remains in Photos, and Retouch is still missing. While Apple Intelligence remains in beta, you would think Apple would offer a switch between the two or keep both in place. Unfortunately, it’s provided a dubious “upgrade” that you’ll have to suffer through (or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671318/how-to-downgrade-macos-revert-back.html\">revert to 15.0 Sequoia</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Martin.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
