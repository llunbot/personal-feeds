This program lets you get dedicated, private access to the full capacity of various quantum processing units (QPUs) without any queues or wait times, connect with quantum computing specialists to receive expert guidance for your workloads, and get early access to features and devices with limited availability to conduct cutting-edge research on today’s noisy quantum devices.</p> \n<p>Since its <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-braket-go-hands-on-with-quantum-computing/\">launch in 2020</a>, Amazon Braket has democratized access to quantum computing by offering on-demand access to various QPUs using shared, public availability windows, where you only pay for the duration of your reservation.</p> \n<p>You can now use Braket Direct to reserve the entire dedicated machine for a period of time on IonQ Aria, QuEra Aquila, and Rigetti Aspen-M-3 devices for running your most complex, long-running, time-sensitive workloads, or conducting live events such as training workshops and hackathons, where you pay only for what you reserve.</p> \n<p>To further your research, you can now engage directly with Braket’s experts through free office hours or one-on-one, hands-on reservation prep sessions. For deeper research collaborations, you can connect with specialists from quantum hardware providers such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/braket/quantum-computers/ionq/\">IonQ</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/braket/quantum-computers/oqc/\">Oxford Quantum Circuits</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/braket/quantum-computers/quera/\">QuEra</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/braket/quantum-computers/rigetti/\">Rigetti</a>, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quantum-solutions-lab/\">Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab</a>, our dedicated professional services team.</p> \n<p>Finally, to truly push the boundaries, you can gain access to experimental capabilities that have limited or reduced availability starting with <a href=\"https://ionq.com/quantum-systems/forte\">IonQ’s highest fidelity, 30-qubit Forte device</a>.</p> \n<p>Braket Direct expands on our commitment to accelerate research and innovation in quantum computing without requiring any upfront fees or long-term commitments.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Getting started with Braket Direct</u></strong><br /> To get started, go to the <a href=\"https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/braket/home?region=us-east-1#/direct/dashboard\">Amazon Braket console</a> and choose <strong>Braket Direct</strong> in the left pane. You can see new features such as quantum hardware reservation, expert advice and get access to next-generation quantum hardware and features.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/11/2023-braket-direct-fig1-overall.png\" width=\"2774\" height=\"1562\" /></p> \n<p><strong>1. Request a quantum hardware reservation</strong><br /> To create a reservation, choose <strong>Reserve device</strong> and select the <strong>Device</strong> that you would like to reserve. Provide your contact information, including your name and email address, any details about the workload that you would like to execute using your reservation, such as desired reservation length, relevant constraints, and desired schedule.</p> \n<p>Braket Direct assures that you have the full capacity of the QPU during your reservation and the predictability that your workloads will execute when your reservation begins.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/24/2023-braket-direct-fig2-reserve-1.png\" width=\"1194\" height=\"1574\" /></p> \n<p>If you are interested in connecting with a Braket expert for a one-on-one reservation prep session after your reservation is confirmed, you can select that option at no additional cost.</p> \n<p>Choose <strong>Submit</strong> to complete your reservation request. A Braket team member will email you within 2–3 business days, pending request verification. To make the most of your reservation, you can choose to pre-create your tasks and jobs prior to a reservation to maximize use of the time.</p> \n<p>To learn more about your quantum tasks and hybrid jobs to execute in a device reservation, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-direct.html\">Get started with Braket Direct</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><strong>2.
