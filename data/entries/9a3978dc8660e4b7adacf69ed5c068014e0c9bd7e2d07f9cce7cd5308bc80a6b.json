Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/\">expected to discontinue</a> the 5.4-inch mini form factor model next year due to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-mini-expected-despite-12-sales/\">poor sales</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe rumored feature that customers are most excited for in the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup is a high-refresh rate 120Hz display, according to 22 percent of survey respondents. 18.2 percent of respondents are hoping for under-display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, but may be disappointed as this is not expected to come to new ‌iPhone‌ models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">until 2023</a>. 16 percent are anticipating an always-on display, while 10.9 percent are excited about the prospect of a smaller notch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe responses also indicated that customers are least excited for new color options, a faster processor, reverse wireless charging, and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, with these potential features being favored in less than five percent of survey responses.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome of Apple's other upcoming products, such as the Apple Watch Series 7 and third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> aroused little interest from survey respondents. 72.7 percent of respondents said that they were not interested in buying the Apple Watch Series 7 and 87.1 percent of respondents said that they were not interested in buying third-generation ‌AirPods‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCompared to the high level of interest in upgrading to the ‌iPhone 13‌, the Apple Watch Series 7 and third-generation ‌AirPods‌ appear to be significantly less enticing to potential customers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>SellCell</em>'s findings were based on survey responses from more than 3,000 ‌iPhone‌ owners aged 18 or older, based in the United States, between July 28 and August 6.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/44-percent-to-upgrade-to-iphone-13/\">44% of iPhone Users Intend to Upgrade to iPhone 13, Survey Shows</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/44-of-iphone-users-intend-to-upgrade-to-iphone-13-survey-shows.2306977/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kD_43Jda-hQ:Lh6TUsePWQk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kD_43Jda-hQ:Lh6TUsePWQk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kD_43Jda-hQ\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a3978dc8660e4b7adacf69ed5c068014e0c9bd7e2d07f9cce7cd5308bc80a6b","category":"Apple"}
