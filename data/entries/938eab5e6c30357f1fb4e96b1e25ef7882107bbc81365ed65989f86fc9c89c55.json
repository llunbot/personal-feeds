Apple explains:\r<br />\n<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognises when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.</blockquote>In addition to Vehicle Motion Cues, Apple is also set to introduce an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/\">eye tracking feature</a> that will let users navigate their ‌iPad‌ and ‌iPhone‌ with just their eyes. It will also debut <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> voice control and new Music Haptics later this year. The latter uses the Taptic Engine in the ‌iPhone‌ to play taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music, allowing users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music. The new features are expected to arrive as part of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, which is likely to be released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/\">Accessibility</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-reduce-motion-sickness-feature/\">Apple to Reduce Motion Sickness With Vehicle Motion Cues on iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-reduce-motion-sickness-with-vehicle-motion-cues-on-iphone.2426409/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"938eab5e6c30357f1fb4e96b1e25ef7882107bbc81365ed65989f86fc9c89c55","category":"Apple"}
