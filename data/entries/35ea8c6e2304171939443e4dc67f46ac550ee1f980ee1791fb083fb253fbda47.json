On January 6th Trek released its 2024 <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/sustainability/?utm_source=Iterable&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=US%20Media%2020250106%20Trek%20Sustainability%20Report_11963890\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainability Report</a>. It’s said to showcase the company’s ongoing commitment to reducing its carbon emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the company’s other initiatives, the report introduces Trek’s low-impact aluminum program along with a “groundbreaking” supplier agreement that’s driving meaningful emissions reductions. Check out the details on the report below! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>John Burke’s Eight Sustainability Solutions… </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Our sustainability report isn’t only about tracking progress — it’s about accelerating it,” </em>said Joel Demeritt, Trek’s Global Sustainability Manager<em>. “We’re setting the groundwork now for a major change in just the next year or two. It’s necessary work that’s making a difference beyond our walls, and we’re excited to get more companies to join us in this effort.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that bikes could be the solution to many of the world’s issues. It could solve problems like climate change, public health, and congestion. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trek-Bikes-2024-Sustainability-Report-birds-eye-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trek-Bikes-2024-Sustainability-Report-birds-eye-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bike's 2024 Sustainability Report bird's eye\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trek-Bikes-2024-Sustainability-Report-birds-eye-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trek-Bikes-2024-Sustainability-Report-birds-eye-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trek-Bikes-2024-Sustainability-Report-birds-eye-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trek-Bikes-2024-Sustainability-Report-birds-eye-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trek-Bikes-2024-Sustainability-Report-birds-eye-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Trek Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Trek Bicycles, the road to sustainability came after their first sustainability report in 2021. It was a raw look at the impact that Trek had – and a roadmap for making things better. Now, after the release of their third report, they say they’ve taken many steps forward. That started with doing an emissions study with a third party. From that study, they set a goal to reduce their emissions which started with reducing packaging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there they explored the carbon footprint of the materials they are using. They were surprised to see that the aluminum they used had nearly the same carbon foot print as carbon fiber composites. Working with their suppliers, Trek notes a change from “dirty to clean” aluminum which has the potential to massively reduce their carbon emissions for aluminum frames. The change is so great that Trek calls it “the single biggest thing to reduce our carbon emissions,” and it has the potential to help them reach their 2032 goal by 2027. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check out the actual report <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/sustainability/?utm_source=Iterable&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=US%20Media%2020250106%20Trek%20Sustainability%20Report_11963890\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/\" target=\"_blank\">TrekBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/low-impact-aluminum-trek-bicycle-2024-sustainability-report/\">Low-Impact Aluminum?
