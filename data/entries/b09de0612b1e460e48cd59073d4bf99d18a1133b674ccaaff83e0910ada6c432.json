It’s been in the works for a long time. After four years in the “planning hopper”, taking their time to “do it right, and do it our way”, the new Sour <a href=\"https://sour.bike/bikes/road/space-cake/\" target=\"_blank\">Space Cake</a> is finally here.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-front-end-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-front-end-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-front-end-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-front-end-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-front-end-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-front-end-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Sour Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sour felt that there was a significant gap in their bike offerings. A road-plus bike was the thing to fill the gap. They set out to design something fast and efficient, but something that could “get weird when the road turns rough”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Space Cake to Tackle the “Paved” Roads</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-cockpit-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-cockpit-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-cockpit-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-cockpit-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-cockpit-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-cockpit-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After countless prototypes and test rides, the Space Cake is here and Sour says it’s the most “road” bike they’ve ever made. The geo is tuned for long road days and adds durability. The tubing and frame parts are designed to be as light and efficient as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-27.2-seatpost-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-27.2-seatpost-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike 27.2 seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-27.2-seatpost-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-27.2-seatpost-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-27.2-seatpost-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-27.2-seatpost-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-head-tube-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-head-tube-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike head tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-head-tube-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-head-tube-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-head-tube-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-head-tube-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the road bikes of yesterday. No more ultra-skinny, high-pressure tires on a “one-trick-pony”, road bike. This all-road bike is built for when the paved road fades into a gravel road and you want to take the long way home. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-carbon-fork-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-carbon-fork-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike carbon fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-carbon-fork-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-carbon-fork-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-carbon-fork-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-carbon-fork-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sour says the Space Cake is light, responsive, and built for speed. Like all of the Sour bike models, the Space Cake comes with its signature, custom powder coating. Choose from bold, classy, or a little off-beat. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-rear-end-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-rear-end-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike rear end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-rear-end-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-rear-end-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-rear-end-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-rear-end-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-road-bike-profile-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-road-bike-profile-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike road bike profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-road-bike-profile-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-road-bike-profile-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-road-bike-profile-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-road-bike-profile-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain biking is at the core of Sour Bikes’ DNA, but they say all-road and gravel are at the heart of Sour’s off-MTB-season. As such, a bike like the Space Cake can be the perfect off-season tool even if you prefer knobby tires and full suspension. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retail and Build Options </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frameset retail: 1,299€ for frame-only, or 1,549€ for the steel frame with the full carbon Space Cake fork<br />Complete bike retail: $5,999 € (Shimano Ultegra Di2)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ultegra Build Kit Details</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rear Derailleur: Shimano Ultegra Di2 RD-R8150</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Front Derailleur: Shimano Di2 FD-R8150</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crankset: Shimano Ultegra FC-R8100, 172,5mm with 50/35t chainrings </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shifters: Shimano Ultegra Di2 ST-R8170+BR-R8170 with RT-CL800S 160mm Discs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cassette: Shimano ULTEGRA CS-R8101 11-30t with CN-M7100 chain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wheelset: Built by hand with Duke Baccara RX 42 SLR2 rims paired with Duke Bad Boy J-Bend, Centerlock hubs. 28h, Sapim bladed spokes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Complete Easton EA90 Cockpit</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Small size: 90mm stem; handlebar 400mm 16° flare; seat post 27,2x350mm; Easton bartape</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Medium and Large  size: 100mm stem; handlebar 420mm 16° flare; seat post 27,2x350mm; Easton bartape</li>\n\n\n\n<li>X-Large size: 110mm stem; handlebar 440mm 16° flare; seat post 27,2x350mm; Easton bartape</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saddle: SQ Lab 611 Ergowave XS-L 140mm XL-XXL 150mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>White Industries Headset</li>\n\n\n\n<li>White Industries Bottom Bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tires, Schwalbe Pro One 700×34 tubeless</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame Features and Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-frame-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-frame-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Sour bikes Space Cake All-Road Bike frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-frame-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-frame-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-frame-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sour-bikes-Space-Cake-All-Road-Bike-frame-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Frame Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tubing: Custom drawn, multiple butted, partly heat treated SOUR CrMo</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Headtube: 44 mm upper and lower</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bottom bracket: External 68mm T47 threaded bottom bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Axle: 12mm x 142mm thru-axle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seat post: 27.2mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brake standard: FM160 Direct.
