Could you really swap parts between laptops—reasonably thin and lightweight laptops—year over year? Would that even work as a business model?</p>\n<p>Framework <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/\">released the first edition</a> of its machine, and we found that it lived up to its promises. The company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/\">followed through</a> with a second-generation laptop, and we reviewed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-framework-laptops-13th-gen-intel-upgrade-helps-fix-its-battery-problem/\">the third iteration</a> as \"a box of parts\" that upgraded the previous version. The upgrade experiment has been a success. All that's left are, well, the parts left behind.</p>\n<p>It's 2023, and those who have Framework's first generation of laptops, containing Intel's 11th-generation Core processor) might be itching to upgrade, especially with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/framework-gives-its-modular-laptops-13th-gen-intel-cpus-and-finally-an-amd-option/\">an AMD model around the corner</a>. Or maybe, like me, they find that system's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/\">middling battery life</a> and <a href=\"https://community.frame.work/t/high-battery-drain-during-suspend-windows-edition/4421\">tricky-to-tame sleep draining</a> (since improved, but not entirely fixed) make for a laptop that doesn't feel all that portable. Or they're just ready for something new.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951787#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951787&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b84e964ccc299dc0cbaf2663ded0fe3a3b0cc530c85315e754e6320de20d37b6","category":"Tech"}
