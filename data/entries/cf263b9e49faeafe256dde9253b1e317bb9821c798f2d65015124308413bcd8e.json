The U1 chip is also included in Apple Watch Series 6, the HomePod mini, the second-generation HomePod, AirTag trackers, and the charging case for the second-generation AirPods Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLooking further ahead, Kuo says the iPhone 16 will feature support for Wi-Fi 7, \"which will be more conducive to Apple's integration of hardware products running on the same local network and provide a better ecosystem experience.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPositioned as the next major generational Wi-Fi technology evolution, Wi-Fi 7 is expected to provide speeds of \"at least 30\" gigabits per second and could even hit 40Gbps, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 7 is also able to use 320MHz channels and supports 4K quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) technology, ultimately providing up to 2.4x faster speeds than Wi-Fi 6 with the same number of antennas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple previewed its Vision Pro headset earlier this month at WWDC, but did not reveal all the details of its hardware specifications. The headset is set to launch early next year, and Apple reportedly plans to launch a more affordable model by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/12/cheaper-apple-vision-headset-2025/\">end of 2025</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ultra-wideband/\">U1 Chip</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/iphone-15-new-u1-chip-vision-pro-headset/\">Kuo: iPhone 15 to Get Next-Gen Ultra Wideband Chip for Enhanced Vision Pro Headset Integration</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-15-to-get-next-gen-ultra-wideband-chip-for-enhanced-vision-pro-headset-integration.2393474/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cf263b9e49faeafe256dde9253b1e317bb9821c798f2d65015124308413bcd8e","category":"Apple"}
