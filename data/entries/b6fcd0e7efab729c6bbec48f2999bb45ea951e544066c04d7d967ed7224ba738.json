Launched in October in partnership with Apple, the program provides monthly financing via Citizens Bank for select Apple products purchased from Best Buy in the U.S., similar to Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program. APRs range from 0% to 29.99% based on creditworthiness, according to the program's fine print.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/ipad-pro-2022.jpg\" alt width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe program is also available for the latest models of the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Studio, and Mac mini, including the new 15-inch MacBook Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe monthly payments are spread across three years. After 36 months, customers who purchase an eligible iPad Pro, Apple Watch Ultra, or Mac have the options of upgrading to a newer device, paying off the remaining balance of the purchase in the 37th month and keeping the device, or returning the device and leaving the program.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUpgrade+ also offers customers the option to finance the purchase of an AppleCare+ plan for their Apple device and select Apple accessories. Best Buy Totaltech members who purchase an iPad Pro or Apple Watch Ultra through the program will receive AppleCare+ at no additional charge for up to 24 months while their membership is active.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore details about the Upgrade+ program are available <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/misc/upgradeplus/pcmcat1660594475091.c\">on Best Buy's website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-buy/\">Best Buy</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/14/best-buy-upgrade-plus-ipad-pro-apple-watch-ultra/\">Best Buy Expands Upgrade+ Program to iPad Pro and Apple Watch Ultra</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/best-buy-expands-upgrade-program-to-ipad-pro-and-apple-watch-ultra.2392948/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b6fcd0e7efab729c6bbec48f2999bb45ea951e544066c04d7d967ed7224ba738","category":"Apple"}
