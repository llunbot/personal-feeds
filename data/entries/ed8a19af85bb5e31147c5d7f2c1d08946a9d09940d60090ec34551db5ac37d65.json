However, this hyper-realistic concept created by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF5HXJItzsx\">WEIS Studio</a> gives us the best idea yet of what Apple's thin device might actually look like.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-air-concept-weis.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe concept design is inspired by recent leaks indicating that the device will have a super-slim 5.5mm profile. For comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro measures 8.25mm in thickness, while the 11-inch M4 iPad Pro comes in at 5.3mm. That measurement doesn't include the camera bump, which could be thicker to accommodate the single 48-megapixel rear camera rumored for the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn terms of size, rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which will put it in between the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max in size. As mentioned, it will have a single-lens rear camera, and Apple could be planning for a horizontal bar-like camera bump at the back. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 17 Air is rumored to come with a 120Hz ProMotion display and Apple's in-house 5G modem. It's also expected to feature the A19 chip, Wi-Fi 7, and a more durable display material designed to resist drops and scratches. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnlike the iPhone 17 Pro models, which prioritize high-end hardware, Apple is reportedly positioning the iPhone 17 Air as a design-focused device. While it may not have the most advanced internal components, its refreshed aesthetic could be a major selling point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF5HXJItzsx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF5HXJItzsx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by WEIS Studio | Global Ð¡reative &amp; Production Company (@weis_studio)</a></p></div></blockquote>\r<br />\n</div>\r<br />\nThere's no word on battery life for the iPhone 17 Air yet, but space will be limited so there may be battery life compromises. The device is expected to be priced more affordably than the iPhone 17 Pro, which will start at $999. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/iphone-17-air-specs-design-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 17 Air Design, Specs, and More: All the Rumors So Far</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe iPhone 17 Air will reportedly replace the iPhone \"Plus\" model in Apple's new lineup, which is set to be released around mid-September.
