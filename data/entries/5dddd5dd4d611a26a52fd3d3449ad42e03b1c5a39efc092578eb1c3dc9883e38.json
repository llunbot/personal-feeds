Using GitHub Actions with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/\">AWS CodeBuild</a> is much easier. Also, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/\">Amazon Q</a> in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/\">Amazon CodeCatalyst</a> can now manage more complex issues.</p> \n<p>I was amazed to meet so many new and old friends at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/emea/london/\">AWS Summit London</a>. To give you a quick glimpse, here’s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/yan-cui/\">AWS Hero Yan Cui</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/danilop/status/1783076902984438147\">starting his presentation at the AWS Community stage</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/29/IMG_3925.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/29/IMG_3925-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"AWS Community at the AWS Summit London 2024\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches<br /> </strong></span>With so many interesting new features, I start with generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) and then move to the other topics. Here’s what got my attention:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\"><strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong></a> – For supported architectures such as Llama, Mistral, or Flan T5, you can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/import-custom-models-in-amazon-bedrock-preview/\">import custom models</a> and access them on demand. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-model-evaluation-is-now-generally-available/\">Model evaluation is now generally available</a> to help you evaluate, compare, and select the best foundation models (FMs) for your specific use case. You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/metas-llama-3-models-are-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/\">access Meta’s Llama 3 models</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\"><strong>Agents for Amazon Bedrock</strong></a> – A <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/agents-for-amazon-bedrock-introducing-a-simplified-creation-and-configuration-experience/\">simplified agent creation and return of control</a>, so that you can define an action schema and get the control back to perform those action without needing to create a specific <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> function. Agents also added <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/agents-amazon-bedrock-anthropic-claude-3-haiku-sonnet/\">support for Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku and Sonnet</a> to help build faster and more intelligent agents.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\"><strong>Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock</strong></a> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/knowledge-bases-amazon-bedrock-multiple-data-sources/\">ingest data from up to five data sources</a> and provide more complete answers. In the console, you can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/knowledge-bases-amazon-bedrock-asking-questions-single-document/\">chat with one of your documents</a> without needing to set up a vector database (read more in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/knowledge-bases-in-amazon-bedrock-now-simplifies-asking-questions-on-a-single-document/\">this Machine Learning blog post</a>).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/\"><strong>Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock</strong></a> – The capability to implement safeguards based on your use cases and responsible AI policies is <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/guardrails-for-amazon-bedrock-now-available-with-new-safety-filters-and-privacy-controls/\">now available with new safety filters and privacy controls</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/\"><strong>Amazon Titan</strong></a> – The new <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-titan-image-generator-and-watermark-detection-api-are-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock\">watermark detection feature is now generally available</a> in Amazon Bedrock. In this way, you can identify images generated by Amazon Titan Image Generator using an invisible watermark present in all images generated by Amazon Titan.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon CodeCatalyst</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-codecatalyst-task-breakdown-issues-amazon-q/\">Amazon Q can now split complex issues into separate, simpler tasks</a> that can then be assigned to a user or back to Amazon Q. CodeCatalyst now also <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/workflow-approvals-amazon-codecatalyst/\">supports approval gates within a workflow</a>. Approval gates pause a workflow that is building, testing, and deploying code so that a user can validate whether it should be allowed to proceed.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\"><strong>Amazon EC2</strong></a> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/removing-adding-auto-assigned-public-ipv4-address/\">remove an automatically assigned public IPv4 address from an EC2 instance</a>. If you no longer need the automatically assigned public IPv4 (for example, because you are migrating to using a private IPv4 address for SSH with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-using-eice.html\">EC2 instance connect</a>), you can use this option to quickly remove the automatically assigned public IPv4 address and reduce your public IPv4 costs.</p> \n<p><strong>Network Load Balancer</strong> – Now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/network-load-balancer-resource-map-aws-management-console/\">supports Resource Map in AWS Management Console</a>, a tool that displays all your NLB resources and their relationships in a visual format on a single page. Note that <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/application-load-balancer-resource-map-aws-management-console/\">Application Load Balancer already supports Resource Map in the console</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS CodeBuild</strong> – Now supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/aws-codebuild-managed-github-action-runners/\">managed GitHub Action self-hosted runners</a>. You can configure CodeBuild projects to receive GitHub Actions workflow job events and run them on CodeBuild ephemeral hosts.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/route53/\"><strong>Amazon Route 53</strong></a> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/unify-dns-management-using-amazon-route-53-profiles-with-multiple-vpcs-and-aws-accounts/\">define a standard DNS configuration in the form of a Profile</a>, apply this configuration to multiple VPCs, and share it across AWS accounts.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\"><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong></a> – Hosted connections now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/aws-direct-connect-gbps-hosted-connection-capacities/\">support capacities up to 25 Gbps</a>. Before, the maximum was 10 Gbps. Higher bandwidths simplify deployments of applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), media and entertainment (M&amp;E), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML).</p> \n<p><strong>NoSQL Workbench for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">Amazon DynamoDB</a></strong> – A <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/nosql-workbench-amazon-dynamo-db-operation-builder-user-interface/\">revamped operation builder user interface</a> to help you better navigate, run operations, and browse your DynamoDB tables.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/\"><strong>Amazon GameLift</strong></a> – Now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-gamelift-containers-support-preview/\">supports in preview end-to-end development of containerized workloads</a>, including deployment and scaling on premises, in the cloud, or for hybrid configurations. You can use containers for building, deploying, and running game server packages.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span><br /> Here are some additional projects, blog posts, and news items that you might find interesting:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/gql-the-iso-standard-for-graphs-has-arrived/\"><strong>GQL, the new ISO standard for graphs, has arrived</strong></a> – GQL, which stands for Graph Query Language, is the first new ISO database language since the introduction of SQL in 1987.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/authorize-api-gateway-apis-using-amazon-verified-permissions-and-amazon-cognito/\"><strong>Authorize API Gateway APIs using Amazon Verified Permissions and Amazon Cognito</strong></a> – Externalizing authorization logic for application APIs can yield multiple benefits.
