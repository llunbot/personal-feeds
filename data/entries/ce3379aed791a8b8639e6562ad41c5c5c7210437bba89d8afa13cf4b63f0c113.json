{"title":"★ Follow-Up on Apple No Longer Including Stickers With New Products","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2024/05/no_more_stickers_follow-up","date":1715829101000,"content":"\n<p>I got some pushback from readers <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/09/no-more-stickers-with-new-ipads\">for saying “Boo hiss”</a> to the news that starting with this week’s new iPads, Apple is no longer including logo stickers in the boxes, and more or less rolling my eyes at the environmental concerns.</p>\n\n<p>My thinking was that with all the other “paperwork” included in the box — warranty info, safety info, Quick Start guides — why not include one extra sheet that’s just for fun? One argument against the stickers is even just one extra sheet adds up. If those stickers are 0.1mm thick, a stack of 1 billion of them would be 100km high. But that’s still just one sheet amongst many others that Apple includes in every box.</p>\n\n<p>The better argument against the stickers is that they’re plastic. All the other in-box paperwork is actual paper, and the packaging itself — including the interior structure — is all cardboard. And paper and cardboard are entirely recyclable. Apple has eliminated almost all plastic from its packaging over the years, including the clear shrink-wrap. So consider my mind changed: eliminating the stickers from the box, but making them available to those who want them at Apple retail stores, is a good compromise.</p>\n\n<p>I conducted the same poll <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1789357342888226861\">on Twitter/X</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/112423787469612252\">Mastodon</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/C61ndfdxxBq\">Threads</a>: “Thoughts on Apple no longer including stickers with new devices to reduce waste?”, with two options: 👍 or 👎. The results:</p>\n\n<table>\n\n<thead>\n<th></th><th>Votes</th><th>👍</th><th>👎</th>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Twitter/X</td><td>3,612</td><td>63%</td><td>38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mastodon</td><td>3,425</td><td>73%</td><td>27%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Threads</td><td>2,711</td><td>71%</td><td>29%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td><td>9,748</td><td>69%</td><td>31%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>As a meta note, I continue to find the relative popularity of the three platforms amongst my followers interesting. Also interesting that Twitter/X respondents were a bit less in favor of the change. And lastly, if you’re interested, all three posts on social media have a slew of replies.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ce3379aed791a8b8639e6562ad41c5c5c7210437bba89d8afa13cf4b63f0c113","category":"Tech"}
