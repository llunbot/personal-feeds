That's right—it's time for the 2021 edition of our annual Charity Drive!</p>\n<p>Every year <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/the-opposable-thumbs-childs-play-giveaway-you-donate-we-give-you-stuff/\">since 2007</a>, we've encouraged readers to give to <a href=\"http://www.childsplaycharity.org/\">Penny Arcade's Child's Play charity</a>, which provides toys and games to kids being treated in hospitals around the world. In recent years, we've added the <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/donate/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to our annual charity push, aiding in their efforts to defend Internet freedom. This year, as always, we're providing some extra incentive for those donations by offering donors a chance to win pieces of our big pile of vendor-provided swag. We can't keep it, and we don't want it clogging up our offices. So it's now yours to win.</p>\n<p>This year's swag pile is full of high-value geek goodies. <strong>We have 39 prizes valued at over $1,600 total</strong>, including hardware, accessories, collectibles, smartwatches, apparel, and more. In 2020, Ars readers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/\">raised a record $58,000 for charity</a>, contributing to a total haul of <strong>more than $394,000 since 2007.</strong> We want to raise even more this year, and we can do it if readers really dig deep.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819712#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819712&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aecbae372ce56167bdaf7770609f36d5d847c42051cbd240d2aa6abd50912b72","category":"Tech"}
