There's a 50MP Sony camera on the back, accompanied by a second depth sensor for portraits, and a 16MP front-facing camera. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nA 5,000 mAh battery offers up to two days of power on a single charge, and the base model comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also supports Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 and 9-band Dual 5G. As it's a budget device, there are a few tradeoffs – there's no NFC, for example, and the device is only splash-resistant. There's also no wireless charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLook beyond the specs though, and the Android phone's big selling point is its unique screw-based system of interchangeable backplates and accessories. CMF Phone (1) users can switch out different colored shells (black, orange, blue, and light green, costing $35 each) using a supplied flathead screwdriver and screws, resulting in a completely different look, right down to a color-matched SIM tray. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne of the screw points includes a dial-style pop-out for mounting optional accessories, including a kickstand, a MagSafe-style wallet case, and lanyard, each costing $25. Accompanying the release of the phone are new <a href=\"https://cmf.tech/en-gb/pages/buds-pro-2\">CMF Buds Pro 2 wireless earbuds</a> and a <a href=\"https://cmf.tech/en-gb/pages/watch-pro-2\">CMF Watch Pro 2 smartwatch</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/nothing-cmf-phone.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nNothing's <a href=\"https://us.nothing.tech/products/cmf-phone-1\">CMF Phone (1)</a> is launching in the UK and the EU this week, with a launch in the US scheduled for later in July under a \"Beta Program,\" so expect high demand and a possible waitlist.
