Gurman also said that it would be marketed as a way to chat with ‌Siri‌, and that the device is \"designed to bring ‌Siri‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> to life in a way that hasn't happened before.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman initially said the device could launch as soon as March 2025, but in January, he suggested Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/apple-smart-home-hub-launch-possibly-delayed/\">would not make</a> that timeline due to ‌Siri‌ delays. With the ‌Siri‌ ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features being pushed back even further, it's entirely possible Apple's \"Command Center\" won't be ready to go until 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's acknowledgement of the delay suggests that the ‌Siri‌ capabilities aren't going to be introduced until <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>, and the timing remains unclear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe smart home hub is expected to look something like a mini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and it will be square in shape with a six-inch display. In addition to controlling smart home products, it will have a selection of Apple apps so people will be able to make video calls, look up recipes, listen to music, access their calendars, view photos, and more.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">Apple Command Center</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/siri-delay-smart-home-command-center/\">What Does the Siri Apple Intelligence Delay Mean for Apple's Rumored Smart Home Command Center?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-does-the-siri-apple-intelligence-delay-mean-for-apples-rumored-smart-home-command-center.2452457/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"864bfb0cc12a3002fb7eff48a2e907d7a494affef4e442e68ac8debba006649b","category":"Apple"}
