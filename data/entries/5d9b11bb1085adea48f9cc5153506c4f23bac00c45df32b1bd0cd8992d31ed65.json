The Game Boy Advance (GBA), its software having crashed nearly two hours ago, will, for example, play a tune based on the game inside it. And if you listen closely enough—using specialty hardware and code—you can tell exactly what game it was singing about. And then theoretically play that same game.</p>\n<p>This was discovered recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheZZAZZGlitch\">by TheZZAZZGlitch</a>, whose job is to \"sadistically glitch and hack the crap out of Pokémon games.\" It's \"hardly a ready-to-use solution,\" the modder notes, as it requires a lot of tuning specific to different source formats. So while there are certainly easier ways to get GBA data from a cartridge, none make you feel quite so much like an audio datamancer.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>TheZZAZZGlitch's demonstration of re-creating Game Boy Advance ROM data using the sounds from a crashing system. </p></div>\n<p>After crashing a GBA and recording it over four hours, the modder saw some telltale waveforms in a sound file at about the 1-hour, 50-minute mark. Later in the sound-out, you can hear the actual instrument sounds and audio samples the game contains, played in sequence. Otherwise, it's 8-bit data at 13,100 Hz, and at times, it sounds <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0-7PSmYYHF0?si=Vi36MhaFJxsIKTUZ&amp;t=44\">absolutely deranged</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997786#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997786&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d9b11bb1085adea48f9cc5153506c4f23bac00c45df32b1bd0cd8992d31ed65","category":"Tech"}
