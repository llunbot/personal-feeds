There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light; a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope.

It is November 8, and yes, we're headed back out to the Lucy mission again. NASA <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/lucy/nasas-lucy-surprises-again-observes-1st-ever-contact-binary-orbiting-asteroid/\">has shared some additional information</a> about an asteroid flyby last week, and there's more goodness to share.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/11/daily-telescope-lucy-finds-not-one-but-two-diamonds-in-the-sky/\">Daily Telescope reported</a> that the Lucy spacecraft had found not one but two asteroids during its flyby of the small main-belt asteroid Dinkinesh. It turns out that was not the whole story. Subsequent data downlinked from the spacecraft revealed that the smaller of the two asteroids is a contact binary—two smaller asteroids in contact with one another.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982133#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982133&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"365e908ded9f4271bac29327cfba22621a1ac4e62361abf39df690b1ef8ba94b","category":"Tech"}
