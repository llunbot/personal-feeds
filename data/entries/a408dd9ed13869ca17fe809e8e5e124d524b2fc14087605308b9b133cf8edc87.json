They’ve won a combined 12 three-week races between them, and filled a load of podium spots besides. As such, their names are always the first to go on any predictions lists for further success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who are the riders waiting in the wings with the potential to break that stranglehold and add their own name to the illustrious list of Grand Tour champions? We look at six likely candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>1. João Almeida (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"joao almeida 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-16-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tour de Suisse/Buchli Fotografie</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>João Almeida is 26 years old yet commands the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates XRG</a> train in Grand Tours with an authority far beyond his years, whether it’s setting up <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Pogačar</a> for stage wins or corralling Juan Ayuso up the Col du Galibier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s more than comfortable in stage races and formed a dynamic tag-team <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-de-suisse-giro-next-gen\" target=\"_blank\">with Adam Yates at the Tour de Suisse</a> last year, with the pair splitting the stages between them and Yates leading leading home a GC 1-2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Pogačar is understandably the team’s number one option right now when it comes to chasing Grand Tour wins, Almeida has been teetering on the edge of a breakthrough success himself since the 2020 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>. Making his Grand Tour debut, he wore the leader’s pink jersey for 15 days and ended up finishing just off the podium. He would go on to place third overall in the 2023 Giro and finished fourth at the Tour de France last year. In all Grand Tours he has completed to date, he has never finished lower than ninth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how does the team balance the ambition of Pogačar, the engine of Almeida and the rise of Juan Ayuso? Almeida could move to a different team to achieve his Grand Tour ambitions, but for now that looks unlikely given the rewards he’ll receive for his loyalty at UAE. He’ll be riding in support of Pogačar at the Tour and Vuelta this season, forgoing his own chance once again barring disaster. All eyes on 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

The 22-year-old is on co-leadership duties with Adam Yates at his debut Giro d’Italia this season and he’s not hiding his Grand Tour ambitions. Yet with several younger riders on UAE vying for the same spot, he’s one that could look for pastures new in order to lead his own team.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tnt-sports-subscription-cycling\">What TNT Sport’s £30.99 per month subscription means for UK cycling fans</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/eurosport-tnt-sports-premium\">Live cycling moves to TNT Sports premium subscription</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-beat-tadej-pogacar\">How do you beat Tadej Pogačar?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a España 2025 route revealed with the Angliru, Bola del Mundo and three stages in Italy</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2025 route revealed with the return of the Colle delle Finestre, Albania stages and Strade Bianche</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2025 route revealed with Mont Ventoux, Superbagnères, La Plagne, Col de la Loze and a mountain TT</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>3.

He was forced to abandon the 2023 Tour before the final week after a crash, but at last year’s race was able to hop back into the top ten with a strong performance on Isola 2000 on Stage 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s looking promising that Jorgenson could become the next American to win a Grand Tour, and his best hope for now is to avoid the Pogačar vs Vingegaard showdown at the Tour and instead focus his efforts on the Giro next season – provided Vingegaard doesn’t fancy a shot at the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\" target=\"_blank\">maglia rosa</a></em> himself, that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

The Spaniard’s 2024 season included what were some of the team’s only highlights <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">in a barren year</a>, winning the final stage and finishing second overall at the Tour of the Basque Country, claiming the overall title at the Tour de Romandie and recovering after a tough start to finish seventh at Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodríguez had already shown his potential the previous year at the Tour, when he took advantage of Pogačar and Vingegaad’s private battle to descend to a famous stage win in Morzine, going on to finish fifth overall despite a crash-hampered final week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having only just turned 24, he should be given the keys to the Ineos kingdom at the Tour and Vuelta this year. The only problem is his schedule is the same as Pogačar and Vingegaard’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

It <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-reflections\" target=\"_blank\">went down to the wire</a> between Skjelmose, Rodríguez and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe’s Florian Lipowitz but the final individual time-trial worked in the Dane’s favour and he took the jersey by over a minute in Madrid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skjelmose wanted to ride the Giro this season but Lidl-Trek have pencilled him in for the Tour instead. It won’t be ideal given the competition and his team’s split support with Jonathan Milan’s sprint hopes, but it will serve as a chance to test his legs again over three weeks against the best in the business. He’s only 24 years old after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grand-tour-not-big-four\">Who could be the next men’s Grand Tour winner outside the Big Four?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a408dd9ed13869ca17fe809e8e5e124d524b2fc14087605308b9b133cf8edc87","category":"Cycling"}
