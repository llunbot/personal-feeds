Then things changed drastically as the planet was plunged into a deep freeze.</p>\n<p>It was previously unclear when Earth became a gargantuan freezer. Now, University College London researchers have found evidence in an outcrop of rocks in Scotland, known as the Port Askaig Formation, that show evidence of the transition from a tropical Earth to a frozen one 717 million years ago. This marks the onset of the Sturtian glaciation and would be the first of two \"<a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0303\">snowball Earth</a>\" events during which much of the planet’s surface was covered in ice. It is thought that multicellular life began to emerge after Earth thawed.</p>\n<p>Found in the Scottish islands known as the Garvellachs, this outcrop within the Port Askaig Formation is unique because it offers the first conclusive evidence of when a tropical Earth froze over—underlying layers that are a timeline from a warmer era to a frigid one. Other rocks that formed during the same time period in other parts of the world lack this transitional evidence because ancient glaciers most likely scraped it off.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049611#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049611&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6977207e959bf75616ebc826ffdab1c26d541bb93b31082f6d70aa497c5ad547","category":"Tech"}
