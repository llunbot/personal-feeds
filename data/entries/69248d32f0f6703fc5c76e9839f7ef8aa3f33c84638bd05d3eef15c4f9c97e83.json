In actuality – and this could go without saying – the phone in question is very likely just showing a poorly superimposed display added in post-production.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ted-lasso-notchless-phone.jpg\" /><div><em>Notchless ‌iPhone‌ in scene from \"Ted Lasso\"</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe mythical notchless ‌iPhone‌ appears in two separate scenes in the second season of \"Ted Lasso,\" specifically in episode six, \"The Signal.\" In both scenes, an ‌iPhone‌ can be seen with an on-screen user interface identifiable as iOS, but without a notch at the top of the display. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe idea that Apple would reveal an unannounced flagship product in a pre-recorded show is certainly a tantalizing prospect, but it's a tenuous theory at best. TV shows routinely apply artificial overlays onto digital displays in post-production in order to make their contents clearer for viewers to see – in this case, an iOS Lock Screen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/notchless-iphone-ted-lasso.jpeg\" /><div><em>Notchless ‌iPhone‌ in scene from \"Ted Lasso\"</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThat's not to say Apple isn't <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/08/product-placement-in-apples-tv-shows/\">penchant to product placement in its shows</a>, but the notch has been a mainstay of the ‌iPhone‌ throughout four generations of the device, and the ‌iPhone 13‌ will be no different, with the notch continuing to remain on the front of Apple's upcoming smartphones. However, the ‌iPhone 13‌ is expected to feature a smaller notch, and several reputable sources have indicated that the notch size <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/07/iphone-13-may-have-a-smaller-notch/\">will shrink</a> in 2021, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLooking further ahead into the future, 2022's \"‌‌iPhone‌‌ 14\" is expected to finally ditch the notch, replacing it with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">Android-style hole-punch camera</a>. Where Apple goes from there is unclear, but a rumor in 2019 claimed Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/26/2020-iphone-prototype-without-notch/\">prototyped at least one iPhone with no notch</a>, with the TrueDepth camera sensors for Face ID instead housed in the thin bezel above the display.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/notchless-iphone-ted-lasso-not-iphone-13/\">No, That Notchless iPhone Spotted in 'Ted Lasso' Isn't the iPhone 13</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/no-that-notchless-iphone-spotted-in-ted-lasso-isnt-the-iphone-13.2309266/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nrc8oQ1V4G4:qSBFzljfXkI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nrc8oQ1V4G4:qSBFzljfXkI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nrc8oQ1V4G4\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"69248d32f0f6703fc5c76e9839f7ef8aa3f33c84638bd05d3eef15c4f9c97e83","category":"Apple"}
