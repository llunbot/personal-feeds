Just combine tea and sugar with a kombucha culture known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOBY\">SCOBY</a> (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast), aka the \"mother,\" also known as a tea mushroom, tea fungus, or a Manchurian mushroom. It's basically akin to a sourdough starter. A SCOBY is a firm, gel-like collection of cellulose fiber (biofilm), courtesy of the active bacteria in the culture creating the perfect breeding ground for the yeast and bacteria to flourish. Dissolve the sugar in non-chlorinated boiling water, then steep some tea leaves of your choice in the hot sugar water before discarding them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009695#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009695&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"896309bf5c5c50cf164689332f5268627e622d4ffb96a83a65d0e2bf073f442a","category":"Tech"}
