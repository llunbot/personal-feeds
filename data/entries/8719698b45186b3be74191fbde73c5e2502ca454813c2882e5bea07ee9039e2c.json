New chief executive Dave Limp, who arrived in December, is working to instill a more productive culture at the firm owned by Jeff Bezos. In January, the company's powerful BE-4 rocket engine performed very well on the debut launch of the Vulcan booster. And later this year, possibly as soon as August, Blue Origin's own heavy-lift rocket, New Glenn, will take flight.</p>\n<p>But wait, there's more. The company has also been hard at work developing hardware that will fly on New Glenn, such as the <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/news/blue-origin-unveils-space-mobility-platform\">Blue Ring</a> transfer vehicle that will be used to ferry satellites into precise orbits. In addition, work continues on a private space station called Orbital Reef.</p>\n<p>One of the key questions about that space station is how astronauts will get there. The only current means of US crew transportation to low-Earth orbit is via Blue Origin's direct competitor, SpaceX, with its Dragon vehicle. This is likely unpalatable for Bezos.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007475#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007475&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8719698b45186b3be74191fbde73c5e2502ca454813c2882e5bea07ee9039e2c","category":"Tech"}
