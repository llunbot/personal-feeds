The file itself is a 12 megapixel image plus a RAW DNG file for additional editing. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Process Zero is fast, capturing at anywhere from 10 — 25× the speed of a ProRAW capture. Much like film, it can feature natural sensor grain, slight color aberrations, and is much less usable in low light. This makes for its natural look, like taking photos on an older classic digital camera,\" explain the developers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHalide 2.15 still allows photographers the choice of process before or during shooting – users can choose processing at setup, or while shooting, picking from ProRAW, standard iPhone photo processing, reduced image processing, or Process Zero. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, the Halide update includes a dial in the app's new Image Lab which lets users re-develop the RAW file with Process Zero for different exposure levels. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/halide-Process-Choice.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1173\" />\r<br />\nLux Optics is eager to stress that many of Apple's image processing features still benefit users, but with Process Zero they can see exactly what images look like when it's completely taken away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/halide-mark-ii-by-lux-camera/id885697368\">Halide 2.15</a> is available today from the App Store with a limited 1-week discount on all new Halide memberships for $11.99 per year (usual price is $19.99). There is also a 1-week free trial with a membership, or users can opt for a lifetime purchase of $59.99.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/\">Halide</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/halide-2-15-lets-users-take-shots-with-zero-computational-processing/\">Halide 2.15 Lets Users Take Shots With Zero Computational Processing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/halide-2-15-lets-users-take-shots-with-zero-computational-processing.2433637/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e93ed653ef6b1b1300a14077baaba0a2d09138656737c9baf9c27e9f7e1cd42e","category":"Apple"}
