Andrew's write-up got me thinking: When was the last time any Ars staffers actually burned an optical disc?</p>\n<h3>Lee Hutchinson, Senior Technology Editor</h3>\n<p>It used to be one of the most common tasks I'd do with a computer. As a child of the '90s, my college years were spent filling and then lugging around <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/cd-binders\">giant binders stuffed with home-burned CDs</a> in my car to make sure I had exactly the right music on hand for any possible eventuality. The discs in these binders were all labeled with names like \"METAL MIX XVIII\" and \"ULTRA MIX IV\" and \"MY MIX XIX,\" and part of the fun was trying to remember which songs I'd put on which disc. (There was always a bit of danger that I'd put on \"CAR RIDE JAMS XV\" to set the mood for a Friday night trip to the movies with all the boys, but I <em>should</em> have popped on \"CAR RIDE JAMS XIV\" because \"CAR RIDE JAMS XV\" opens with Britney Spears' \"Lucky\"—look, it's a <em>good song</em>, and she <em>cries</em> in her <em>lonely heart</em>, OK?!—thus setting the stage for an evening of ridicule. Those were just the kinds of risks we took back in those ancient days.)</p>\n<p>It took a while to try to figure out what the very last time I burned a disc was, but I've narrowed it down to two possibilities. The first (and less likely) option is that the last disc I burned was a Windows 7 install disc because I've had a Windows 7 install disc sitting in a paper envelope on my shelf for so long that I can't remember how it got there. The label is in my handwriting, and it has a CD key written on it. Some quick searching shows I have the same CD key stored in 1Password with an \"MSDN/Technet\" label on it, which means I probably downloaded the image from good ol' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_TechNet\">TechNet</a>, to which I maintained an active subscription for years until MS finally <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/microsoft-killing-off-technet-subscriptions/\">killed the affordable version</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042118#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042118&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f58bfbf79ba7f278f08d341697acba0615827253cadcd7487f2ae115b5c8191d","category":"Tech"}
