In a report today, Kuo outlines his expectations for the device, noting that it will have an approximately 7.8-inch \"crease-free\" inner display and a 5.5-inch outer display, matching a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/\">rumor from last month</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-Fold-Vertical-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" />\r<br />\nKuo says that the foldable ‌iPhone‌ will measure between 9 and 9.5 mm when folded, and around 4.5 to 4.8 mm when unfolded. It will feature a titanium alloy casing with a hinge made of stainless steel and titanium alloy, and it will have a dual-lens rear camera with a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, Kuo says that the phone will forgo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> authentication, instead using a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> side button as a means to save precious internal space. It will also be positioned as a \"true AI-driven phone,\" with the larger screens allowing for a better multi-tasking AI experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith premium pricing above $2,000 and perhaps even above $2,500, Kuo believes the foldable ‌iPhone‌ will tap into Apple's loyal fanbase, some of whom will view it as a \"must-have device\" if its quality meets expectations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo says Apple is aiming to finalize the specs of its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ during the second quarter of this year and officially kick off the project in the third quarter. Mass production is reportedly planned for the fourth quarter of 2026, so we could perhaps see a launch late next year or in early 2027. A second-generation model is said to be in the pipeline for a year later.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kuo/\">Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">Kuo: Apple's First Foldable iPhone to Feature Book-Style Design, Sell for Over $2,000</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apples-first-foldable-iphone-to-feature-book-style-design-sell-for-over-2-000.2452123/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dbb3db72749b60962f0118085c71ec211ad013aa391e3eef26652c68a24eb4e7","category":"Apple"}
