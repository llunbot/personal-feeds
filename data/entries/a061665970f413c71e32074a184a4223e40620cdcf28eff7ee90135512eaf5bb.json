The 8 Elite uses a \"brand-new, 2nd-generation Qualcomm Oryon CPU\" with clock speeds up to 4.32 GHz, which Qualcomm says will improve performance by about 45 percent compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p>\n<p>Rather than a mix of large, medium, and small CPU cores as it has used in the past, the 8 Elite has two \"Prime\" cores for hitting that high peak clock speed, while the other six are all \"Performance\" cores that peak at a lower 3.53 GHz. But it doesn't look like Qualcomm is using a mix of different CPU architectures anymore, choosing to distinguish the higher-performing core from the lower-performing ones by clock speed alone.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/qualcomm-brings-laptop-class-cpu-cores-to-phones-with-snapdragon-8-elite/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/qualcomm-brings-laptop-class-cpu-cores-to-phones-with-snapdragon-8-elite/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a061665970f413c71e32074a184a4223e40620cdcf28eff7ee90135512eaf5bb","category":"Tech"}
