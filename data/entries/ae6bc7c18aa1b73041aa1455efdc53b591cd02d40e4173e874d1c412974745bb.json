{"title":"Peppermint Cycling Adds MTB Overalls + Women’s Jerseys","link":"https://bikerumor.com/peppermint-cycling-spring-collection/","date":1682695393000,"content":"<p>Peppermint Cycling Co. just announced its spring line — a collection that includes new pieces across MTB, gravel, and road disciplines. The launch represents the Canadian <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-womens-bike-helmets/\" target=\"_blank\">women-specific</a> brand’s first foray into the American market. Maybe the best news? There’s a range of colorways beyond the typical pinks and purples. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are thrilled to bring our brand to the US and share our passion for cycling with American cyclists,” said Genevieve Grondin, VP of Sales and Marketing at Peppermint Cycling Co., in a press release. “Our mission is to provide female-identifying cyclists with the best possible apparel. Women shouldn’t have to choose between function and style when getting out on the road and trails, and we see lots of opportunity in the U.S. to build a community of riders like we have in Canada.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allow us to present a few choice nuggets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MTB Overall sports a zippered chest pocket and a zippered side opening for ventilation. Elastic at the waist and ankles aims for comfort, while the fabric is a “water-repellent, four-way stretch” material (92 percent nylon, 8 percent spandex). MSRP is $220. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-800x1200.webp\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-800x1200.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/K2602_E131_2-scaled.webp 1707w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the gravel-y side of the road, Peppermint Cycling offers an Italian-made jersey with two side pockets, three back pockets, and a rear zipper pocket. The “high-quality Italian fabric” garment gets mesh panels on the underarms as well as features you’d expect, like reflective details and a silicone drop hem waistband. All that Italian craftsmanship comes at a cost: MSRP is $190. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there’s the MTB Shirt, a button-up number that’s more chillaxed than the riding you might be doing in it. The pattern is a lightly abstracted flower motif — feminine without being overly cutesy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes in a few tie-die variations. But don’t worry; the neutral tones remain intact. A side zipper pocket is the only notable feature, but hey, what more do you need on a shirt like this? MSRP is a cool $160. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peppermint-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Peppermint Cycling Co.’s spring line also includes shorts, socks, and other apparel.
