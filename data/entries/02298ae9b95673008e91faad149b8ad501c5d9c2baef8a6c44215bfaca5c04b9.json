This is an official shot from Google's video.                           [credit:\n                              Google                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>I guess the Pixel Fold wasn't going to be a surprise to anyone after all the leaks, so why not just announce it? Google posted <a href=\"https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/pixel-is-open/?\">a teaser site</a> for the long-awaited foldable, where you can join a mailing list for \"The first foldable phone engineered by Google.\" This is the first time the company has acknowledged the Fold's existence.</p>\n<p>We've already been through <a href=\"https://www.howtoisolve.com/all-about-google-pixel-fold-leaks-renders/\">CAD-based renders</a>, one very brief <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/googles-pixel-fold-is-real-first-ever-live-footage-surfaces/\">hands-on video</a>, and the leak of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/official-pixel-fold-pictures-show-off-big-bezels-inner-display/\">official renders</a>, but we can still learn a bit from the video. Namely it's clear that the sides and camera bar of the phone have been polished to a mirror finish, just like the Pixel 7 Pro. That mirror finish will very quickly show scratches, and the camera bar on our Pixel 7 Pro hasn't held up well over time. Like we said in our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pixel-7-pro-review-google-makes-refinements-to-the-best-android-phone/6/#h1\">Pixel 7 Pro review</a>, the cheaper Pixel 7 went out the door with a matte sandblasted aluminum finish, and that both looks better and is more durable.</p>\n<p>We're only getting official looks at the phone todayâ€”the specs and pricing will presumably be revealed at I/O. Rumors from CNBC have the phone shipping in June for $1,700+. The Fold is expected to have a 7.6-inch inner display and a 5.8-inch outer display and ship with the usual Google Tensor G2 chip.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936858#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936858&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"02298ae9b95673008e91faad149b8ad501c5d9c2baef8a6c44215bfaca5c04b9","category":"Tech"}
