One can see the appeal to the designer—slick-looking fiat panels trump dust-attracting seams, for starters. The bean counters love them, too—it takes less time to install the subassemblies, and that means a little more profit per car. It's just that they suck. And now, some Volkswagen drivers say capacitive buttons are to blame for their car crashes.</p>\n<p>Capacitive buttons require only the lightest of touches to register a button push. That's mostly a positive thing for buttons on the center console, but when those controls are on bits of trim you might touch by accident, you can run into problems.</p>\n<p>For example, capacitive buttons are sometimes put on the spokes of a multifunction steering wheel, as in the image above. In some maneuvers—parking, for example—it's possible to brush either one of the panels of buttons with a palm. If it's the spoke on the right side, an accidental touch will just mess with the audio system, which is annoying and perhaps a bit distracting.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038577#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038577&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
