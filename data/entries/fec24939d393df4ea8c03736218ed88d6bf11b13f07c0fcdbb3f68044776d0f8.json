The larger 100W version retails for $99.99 and is equipped with three USB-C ports rated at 100W and one USB-A port rated at 18W. (The 100W version is currently out of stock.)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/hyper-stackable-gan-charger.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nHyper says GaN semiconductor material based on Navitas GaNFast technology allows these chargers to be 10x smaller, 100x faster, and 5x more power efficient than traditional silicon chargers. A report earlier this year claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/apple-gan-chargers-rumor/\">Apple is planning its own GaN chargers</a>, but it is unclear when they would be released.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Hyper.
