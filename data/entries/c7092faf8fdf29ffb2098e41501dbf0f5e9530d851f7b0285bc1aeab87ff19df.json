The device has been in development for more than a decade and features an array of sophisticated technologies that allow it to display augmented reality content superimposed on the world around you, and entirely virtual content for immersive entertainment and gaming experiences.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStarting at $3,499, the wearable headset device features two micro-OLED displays that deliver over 4K resolution to each eye, and an external display called EyeSight that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in an immersive mode or if you can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts ($149) that can be attached magnetically to the headset's lenses, and optional readers ($99) will be available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device includes an array of sensors and cameras for monitoring hand gestures and mapping the external environment, and there are speakers on either side of the headset. Vision Pro is powered by an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> processor and a separate R1 processor dedicated to processing information coming from these sensors. It also comes with 16GB of RAM and at least 256GB of onboard storage, with the potential for Apple to offer models with up to 1TB of storage, although this hasn't been officially confirmed. An external battery pack is included in the box.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-vision-pro-pre-order-need-to-know/\">Pre-Ordering Apple Vision Pro: What You Need to Know</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple is planning to produce between 60,000 and 80,000 Vision Pro units for the February 2 launch of the device, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/\">according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.
