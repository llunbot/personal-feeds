With <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mone-bikes-sb2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">my personal builds</a>, I like to tinker and experiment <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/black-cat-bicycles-swami-rigid-29er-mtb-review/\" target=\"_blank\">all the time</a>. So when I began stripping <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/how-to-silver-dropper-post/\" target=\"_blank\">dropper post stanchions</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-hack-strip-entire-dropper-post/\" target=\"_blank\">dropper posts entirely</a>, I was curious if anything would come from it or if brands were listening to not only my, but our audience’s calls for silver stanchions.</p>\n<p>One of the finds today at the Sea Otter Classic was this PNW Components dropper post. Aaron Kerson, the co-founder and co-owner of PNW Components said he saw what I was doing over here and whipped up a sample dropper. His team was apprehensive but he thinks it’s a good idea. There’s talk of only 100 posts coming out in a run but I think that’s not enough.</p>\n<p>Let the PNW Components team know in the comments if they should make a run of silver droppers with anodized bases! The way I see it, people like silver components and why not offer one?</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/pnw-components-silver-stanchion-dropper/\">Sea Otter Classic 2024: PNW Components Silver Stanchion Dropper Post</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"be162dae483800101dbe8c7f5513695a0dd2c53595ccc0b10ca324f5c9619d7a","category":"Cycling"}
