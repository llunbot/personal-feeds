The question behind <em>Mario Party Superstars</em> on the Switch is whether you can find 100 of those mini-games that are actually <em>good</em>.\n<p>The answer is a resounding yes. By focusing on the best and most enduring mini-game design from over two decades, <em>Superstars</em> is probably the most consistently enjoyable game in the series' long run. But if you're not already on board with <em>Mario Party</em>'s slow pace and heavy reliance on luck, there's nothing here that will change your mind.</p>\n<h2>Better to be lucky than to be good</h2>\n<p><em>Mario Party Superstars</em> is a game dripping with nostalgia, from the music and sound effects to the menu screen drawn straight from the first game. The structure of the main game is completely unchanged as well. Four human or computer-controlled players take turns rolling a 10-sided die to move around a board, trying to pass spots where they can buy the stars needed to win the game. After everyone has rolled, all four players face off in a mini-game where they can earn coins that can be used to buy stars or items that can help them or hinder others.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-2-640x360.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-2.jpg\">The Switch's graphical power means this level looks more scrumptious than ever.</a> </p></div>\n<p>    </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808438#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808438&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b44e062e1fc926672da3c165c8fa4ea45431583170ae8c8cac0d1352ce61c3f9","category":"Tech"}
