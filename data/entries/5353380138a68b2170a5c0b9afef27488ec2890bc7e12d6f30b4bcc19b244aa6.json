But the lower-court ruling was reversed on September 20 in a unanimous decision by three appellate court judges.</p>\n<p>Georgia McGinty had agreed to Uber's arbitration clause long before the accident. But the couple challenged the terms in part because they say their minor daughter, then 12, was the one who clicked the most recent terms agreement when the girl ordered food through Uber Eats. Those newer terms were also allegedly less specific about users waiving the right to a jury trial.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053490#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053490&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5353380138a68b2170a5c0b9afef27488ec2890bc7e12d6f30b4bcc19b244aa6","category":"Tech"}
