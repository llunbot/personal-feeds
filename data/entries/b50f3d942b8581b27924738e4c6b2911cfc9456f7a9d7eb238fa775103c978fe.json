It's a tricky kind of celebration because, for many of us, every day is a Wikipedia Day. Scanning a new Wikipedia tab can feel like turning on a faucet, using a resource that has seemingly always been there and dispensed evenly, almost magically, from the Internet pipes.</p>\n<p>But that's not where Wikipedia comes from.

Now, he's exploring the distinctive lives, interests, and conflicts of this tribe in a fiction tome, <em><a href=\"https://www.stephenharrison.com/\">The Editors</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Editors</em> follows Morgan Wentworth, a recently laid-off journalist who scopes out a freelance story at a global conference for the book's Wiki stand-in, Infopendium. Wentworth sees the breadth of ages, personalities, and motivations among the editors and comes to appreciate their dedication.
