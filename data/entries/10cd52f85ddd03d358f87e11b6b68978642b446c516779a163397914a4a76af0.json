Lowe's said that its pilot test was successful, which is why the Vision Pro will roll out to new locations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLowe's Style Studio lets customers view a 3D kitchen environment that can be customized with hundreds of real-world materials, fixtures, and appliances. The app is available in the Vision Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, but customers who do not have a Vision Pro can use it at Lowe's stores.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the initial test run, Lowe's has added new options including trending colors and popular kitchen designs. There's also a new teleport feature that lets users view their kitchen from different viewpoints within the room, without moving.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA Lowe's employee will guide customers through the kitchen creation process during a one-on-one 45-minute appointment, where there are 80 billion design combinations available. Completed kitchen setups can be saved, emailed, texted, or AirDropped as a PDF, with the content in the kitchen able to be purchased through Lowe's.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSessions are free, and customers in the Austin area can book a consultation online using the Lowe's website. Vision Pro headsets will be available at Texas stores for approximately three months, with appointments to start on March 15.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/lowes-vision-pro-expansion/\">Lowe's Expanding Vision Pro 'Style Studio' Experience to Additional Stores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lowes-expanding-vision-pro-style-studio-experience-to-additional-stores.2452745/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"10cd52f85ddd03d358f87e11b6b68978642b446c516779a163397914a4a76af0","category":"Apple"}
