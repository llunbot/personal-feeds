The rest of this article originally posted on October 24, 2023.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cisco kicked off its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.webexone.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2112933-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">WebexOne</a> conference on Tuesday with some big news for Apple fans—you can now take Webex calls on your Apple TV 4K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Webex app for the Apple TV 4K works similarly to the FaceTime app to allow users to participate in meetings through a TV connected to an Apple TV 4K. Users can log into a meeting using a mobile phone to scan a QR code on the TV. Since the Apple TV 4K does not have a camera or microphone, users can take advantage of tvOS 17’s new Continuity Camera support, which connects with an iPhone or iPad that can be set up as the Apple TV’s camera and mic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Webex App for the Apple TV 4K was mentioned during Apple’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/tvos-17-brings-facetime-and-video-conferencing-to-apple-tv-4k/&amp;xcust=1-1-2112933-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">tvOS 17 announcement</a> at WWDC. That announcement focused on FaceTime’s integration into tvOS 17. The Webex App uses the Continuity Camera application programming interface (API) introduced at WWDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Webex App for Apple Watch can now show a list of meetings and users can tap on a meeting to join it in audio-only mode. If a user has paired the Apple Watch with AirPods, the Webex App can use the AirPods’s microphone and the user can speak during a meeting.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Webex Apple Watch\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-watch-webex.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>The Webex App for Apple Watch now lets users join a meeting in audio-only mode from the watch itself.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Cisco</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Webex App for the Apple TV 4K and Apple Watch can be downloaded through the Apple App Store. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://blog.webex.com/hybrid-work/webex-apple-watch-and-tv/&amp;xcust=1-1-2112933-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">More details can be found on the Webex blog</a>.</p>\n\nApple TV, Apple Watch, Professional Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3fbf4d41b50953076c37f247dd4910d2b00b1b9cf97833b3ea65cb2ae3c40c15","category":"Apple"}
