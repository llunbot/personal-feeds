What if you could use a single set of input devices to control multiple Macs—and sometimes iPads?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest operating system updates from Apple offer Universal Control for Macs and iPads, a solution for sharing keyboards and pointers in many situations. Where Universal Control doesn’t fit, you can try a hardware or software KVM, which can share a set of input devices among multiple computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Universal Control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal Control lets you use a keyboard, mouse, or trackpad across multiple devices logged into the same iCloud account and that are in proximity to one another. MacOS Monterey version 12.4 or later and iPadOS 15.4 or later are required. You also have to have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve written elsewhere about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/609440/how-to-universal-control-mac-ipad-mouse-keyboard-settings.html\">how to set up Universal Control</a>, and Apple offers <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757&amp;xcust=1-1-785277-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">this detailed setup guide</a> that includes minimum hardware model requirements for Macs and iPads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hardware KVM</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Called KVM long ago for “keyboard, video, and mouse,” a KVM switch was an important tool for system and network administrators to avoid the clutter of extra bulky CRTs and keyboards in server rooms and elsewhere. Later, KVMs became handy for those who wanted to dock a laptop next to a desktop setup and use a larger monitor, full-sized keyboard, and mouse, trackball, or trackpad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those KVMs had to include a VGA connection, multiple serial and audio connectors, and sometimes USB 1.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, a KVM can be much simpler: you just need USB Type-A ports and can use USB-C adapters as necessary to connect to your Macs.
