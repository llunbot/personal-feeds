And now, the race's time in Italy is </span><span>coming to a close</span><span>. But it will not be forgotten anytime soon and will go down as one of the most memorable Tour de France starts ever.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is hard to believe that the Tour never started in Italy. But the race organisers more than made up for it this year with the spectacular backdrop of the Renaissance city of Florence. From the riders climbing the podium on the Piazzale Michelangelo for the official team presentation, to the moment they rolled over the Ponte Vecchio on their way out of town on stage one, the city offered one of the most spectacular stages for a bicycle race ever, and placing the bar very high for the upcoming stage starts.</span></p>\n<p><span>The riders wasted little time turning up the heat in the already sweltering temperatures. The French got off to one of their best Tour starts in modern memory with back-to-back wins with Romain Bardet and</span><span> </span><span>Kevin Vauquelin. Eritrea’s Binaim Girmay raised his arms at the line in Turin, giving his country its first-ever stage win in the Tour. </span></p>\n<p><span>Meanwhile, the Italian fans, the esteemed </span><em><span>Tifosi</span></em><span>, lined the roadside throughout the three-day affair, and although at times, they seemed to take on a French accent, town after town was decorated in yellow, instead of the Giro d’Italia pink.</span></p>\n<p><span>And while the Tour returns to home soil on stage four today with a mountainous stage to Valloire, this year’s Tour send-off will remain in our memory for years </span><span>to come</span><span>.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01_team_presentation_vingegaard_Pre-Tour_TDF_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1719857540\" /></div>\n<p>Two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard waves to the fans at the team presentation while the city of Florence and its famed Duomo offered one of the most striking backdrops ever.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02_stg01_florence_remake_tdf_2024_59440cbc-0cc1-4927-a359-9ca8a2f4cdde_1024x1024.jpg?v=1719857821\" /></div>\n<p>The Tour de France director's car leads the riders through the Piazza del Duomo as they wind their way through the city. </p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/03_stg01_bardet_podium02_tdf_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1719857540\" /></div>\n<p>Bravo Romain! Everyone here at the Tour was happy for Romain Bardet, who stormed to victory on stage one and captured the first yellow jersey of this year's race. The Frenchman announced this would be his last Tour de France, and while he has finished both second and third in the race, he never wore the yellow jersey, even for a day. </p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/04_stg02_Cesenatico_old_port_tdf_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1719857542\" /></div>\n<p>Stage two of this year's race rolled past the old port in the seaside town of Cesenatico, home to Marco Pantani. </p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/05_stg02_devil_pantani_fan_tdf_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1719857541\" /></div>\n<p> Even the devil saluted Marco Pantani in the stage start in Cesenatico.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06_stg02_fans_italy01_tdf_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1719857542\" /></div>\n<p>The pack rolled along miles and miles of beaches early in stage two as the race cycled up the Adriatic Coast.

Now the only question is just how long he can keep it. </p>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Rouleur_StaffBanners_desktop_JamesStartt_5a6f2994-2e06-49a7-8d46-a6b52de659cf.jpg?v=1719861464\" /></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"f3f92358cab55eb91186943553df624fe4d6fd88273e199c860bee454e94793b","category":"Cycling"}
