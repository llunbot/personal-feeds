However, for Waze users on Android, where issues haven't cropped up, Google Assistant will remain in place.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Conversational Reporting system, currently in beta testing with select users, allows drivers to report road hazards and traffic conditions using natural language. Instead of memorizing specific command phrases, users can speak normally with statements like \"There's a crash up ahead,\" and the app will understand and process the information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf more details are needed, the system can engage in a dialogue, asking follow-up questions like \"Can you tell me more about the crash?\" The conversational approach aims to keep driver distraction to a minimum while maximizing the usefulness of community-reported information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe transition is already underway â€“ Google Assistant is being phased out of the iOS app immediately. While Waze hasn't announced a specific release date for the Gemini-powered replacement, it's expected to launch widely after the beta testing period concludes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe switch follows a number of recently introduced new Waze features, such as school zone alerts to warn drivers to reduce speed near educational institutions.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/waze/\">Waze</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/waze-ios-conversational-reporting/\">Waze on iOS Kills Buggy Google Assistant for 'Conversational Reporting'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/waze-on-ios-kills-buggy-google-assistant-for-conversational-reporting.2454088/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"919201489782087f456feefc9a662bf8eb3f4f49115ee25f5a198c77ee4fe71c","category":"Apple"}
