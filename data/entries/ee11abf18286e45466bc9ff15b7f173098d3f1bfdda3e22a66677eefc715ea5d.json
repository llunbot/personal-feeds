Rikke was 2019 Masters World Champion, beating off high-altitude rivals despite living in the eighth flattest country on Earth: Denmark, average elevation 34m.

Obviously, some people just don’t need to sleep, otherwise how else has Rikke found time to guide me round Copenhagen today?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>And we’re away</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a one-time Londoner who lived in the capital during lockdown, there was the briefest of moments when the city centre was a cycling utopia for me, and ever since I’ve wondered how else this might be achieved without the need for humanity to be facing grim death. And there is a way, I figured: just look at Copenhagen. From the World Economic Forum to the UCI, it has been given accolade after accolade, all declaring the same thing: this is the most bicycle-friendly city in the world. So why here, and why not a city like London?</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen bike city\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>‘The Kissing Bridge’ is open to cyclists unless it is retracting to let boats through – just beware the tight turn at the end that slows bikes down, sometimes rather suddenly.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>OK, there is the obvious argument of population; Copenhagen’s is around 660,000 while Inner London (because Greater London is too much of a sprawl to be a useful comparison) has a population of 3.54 million. Yet this doesn’t quite stack up, as Copenhagen isn’t exactly shy of people – population density here is 7,332/km2, compared to London at 11,098/km2. For context, Manchester is 4,716/km2, Britain’s smallest city by population, St Davids in Wales, is 1,728km2, and Britain’s least populated place, Eden in Cumbria, is just 26/km2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Rikke and I pedal out from Copenhagen’s old town, Indre By, another reason is already obvious – the sheer number of cycle lanes. Official sources here count 546km, most of which is segregated. According to Transport for London, there are just 360km of similar cycleways in the UK’s capital. It also might help that Copenhagen’s first cycle lane appeared in 1905, some 29 years before the UK opened its first… along the A40 in west London. Needless to say the cyclists of 1934 Britain gave it a tepid welcome.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen bike city\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Christiana bikes are made in the eponymous community set up by hippies.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After 5km of mostly segregated lanes, Rikke calls out for a coffee stop. To our left, the words ‘Bosch’ and a huge cartoon sparkplug are writ large in neon, a local landmark of the achingly cool Meatpacking District, where industrial spaces like this old auto parts warehouse have been turned into funky cafes, restaurants and galleries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is home to one of Copenhagen’s best coffee shops (after her own, says Rikke), which unsurprisingly given its name – Prolog – is a popular haunt for cyclists. For snobs and bluffers, I’m told the reason a Copenhagen flat white tastes as it does is the Dane’s use of slightly soured milk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffees reduced to tide marks, we wind our way through the streets and across the <em>Cykelslangen</em>, whose twisting, elevated passage makes supreme sense given its translated nickname: the Bicycle Snake. This is one of three pedestrian and bike-only bridges across Copenhagen’s Inner Harbour, a concrete and wire totem to the Danes’ love of cycling and design. ‘We think of our architects like other people think of movie stars,’ says Rikke.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen bike city\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We continue up the eastern side of the harbour, the Copenhagen Opera House ahead, the neighbourhood of Freetown Christiana to our right. The former is one of Denmark’s most controversial buildings, gifted by Mærsk shipping magnates and heavily criticised by its architect, Henning Larsen, who wrote a whole book about how much he hated it. Larsen described it as <em>bygherreinficerede</em>, a brilliant word meaning ‘owner infected’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christiana, on the other hand, couldn’t be more different. A hippy community set up on an old military base, it enjoys a murky relationship with the city as a place where cannabis is openly sold and smoked. It’s also where Christiana bikes are made, those wooden-box cargo trikes you may have seen at the school gates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of schools, there’s another feather in the Copenhagen cap: local authorities, and even schools themselves, can apply for schemes and grants to lower the density of traffic in their area so as to make the school run more appealing by bike.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen bike city\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Denmark is full of monuments to itself, such as the 26-metre-tall Tuborg beer bottle and statue of polar explorer Knud Rasmussen looking out to sea.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In London, it’s estimated the school run is responsible for 27% of all morning traffic, with 20-25% average for the rest of the UK. By contrast, Copenhageners ride a bike for more than half of all journeys, from dropping off the kids to getting to work, whereas this mode share in the UK is less than 5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cross back over the harbour on arguably the most famous of the bridges here, <em>Inderhavnbroen</em>, but better known by its nickname ‘the Kissing Bridge’, so-called for the way its two halves retract and close to let boats through. It’s also infamous with cyclists for a tight turn off the end which has seen its fair share of spills. Apparently the locals actually quite like it this way though. ‘It means people have to slow down,’ says Rikke.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Mermaids, deers and trains</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Who’s the most famous Dane? While recent years may have seen Jonas Vingegaard knock Peter Schmeichel down into third, top spot will forever be Hans Christian Andersen. Adored by generations and venerated in Disney, Andersen has been commemorated on the edge of Copenhagen’s harbour with a statue. Only it’s not of Andersen but of his creation, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, which now stands as a Danish national symbol as much as anything else. So much so <em>Den lille Havfrue</em> has twice been decapitated, has had her arm removed, her body daubed in paint, a dildo inserted in her hand and had her base blown up with explosives so as to tip her into the harbour, all in the name of political causes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing north, we pass other monuments to Denmark – the 26-metre-tall Tuborg beer bottle, Mærsk container ships, a statue of polar explorer Knud Rasmussen looking wistfully out to sea. And, if you’re into this kind of thing, one of the most famous petrol stations in the world, the <em>Skovshoved Tankstation</em> designed by Arne Jacobsen and looking every bit like it has been lifted from <em>The Jetsons</em> – a 1930s imagining of a future that never happened.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen bike city\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Our turning point is the <em>Jægersborg Dyrehave</em>, a forest-cum-country park populated by deer and used by Copenhageners as a country retreat for walking and cycling. In another world, another city, there would be far fewer families here with cycling kids, but Copenhagen is different. It has the S-train, a station for which is just outside the park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, most cities have trains, and most trains you can take your bike on. But unlike the UK, where obtaining a bike space on a train can be Kafka-esque (and that’s if there’s even one available), S-trains carry dozens of bikes at a time, in neat carriages where you can sit with your bike.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen bike city\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Copenhagen’s famous Skovshoved Tankstation looks like a petrol station out of The Jetsons.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We board the train at Klampenborg Street for a few krone, and several stops later we emerge from Nørreport station via one of the largest bike parking situations I’ve ever seen. Racks upon racks of bikes are parked dozens deep, a small sea of the things, unlike the environs of any station I’ve seen. Immediately my UK brain kicks in and I realise I have one more question for Rikke: what about bike theft? Surely that’s a problem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘No, not really. The thing is, there are more bicycles than people here anyway, and really everyone has the same kind of bike, so why would you want to steal anyone else’s?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s simple enough logic and, like everything I’ve seen here to do with cycling today, it just works.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Planning to succeed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>An expert guide to what makes Copenhagen so bike-friendly</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen bike city\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/copenhagen-bike-city-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The S-train network is designed for people travelling by bike – something of an alien concept in the UK.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We have time on our side,’ says Niels Hoe, who has worked in urban planning for more than 20 years, including for the City of Copenhagen, and currently runs Hoe360 Consulting, specialising in walking, cycling and green mobility projects. ‘We’ve been building bike lanes for more than 100 years – but for me the biggest difference between Copenhagen and so many other places is funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When budgets are discussed here, cycling is a given like car infrastructure is a given, and municipalities don’t have to fight for one-off lump sums. That means you can plan for the future. It also means planners don’t have that terrifying thing where suddenly they’re given €100 million as a one-off, then if anything doesn’t go right and they need to revisit it, the answer’s “no, you had your money”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Another thing is people here understand the situation – there’s a huge societal benefit to cycling and the big thing is health. People in better physical health need less care, take fewer sick days and are happier and more productive. If you cycle a bike you effectively give the economy 7DKK [approx 80p] per kilometre [driving a car actually costs the economy 6.5DKK/74p per kilometre].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Often the argument is that if you take away parking outside shops and put in bike lanes then you lose business, but studies show that cyclists spend an equal amount of money. They just shop more often, plus there is a bigger chance of running into someone you know and stopping for a drink or food and spending money that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Then the last thing: it’s obvious to Copenhageners that if you replaced the bikes with cars, things wouldn’t be very nice – the noise, the pollution – so I think even when governments change, the cycling policy doesn’t. The people wouldn’t stand for it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 153 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-de-france-2022-stage-1-tt-gallery\">Wetting the appetite: Behind the scenes gallery at the Tour de France Stage 1 in Copenhagen</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/government-to-invest-further-175-million-in-cycling-and-walking-infrastructure\">Government to invest further £175 million in cycling and walking infrastructure</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-and-london-a-tale-of-two-cycling-cities\">Paris and London: A tale of two cycling cities</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/copenhagen-city-of-bikes\">Copenhagen: City of bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ee11abf18286e45466bc9ff15b7f173098d3f1bfdda3e22a66677eefc715ea5d","category":"Cycling"}
