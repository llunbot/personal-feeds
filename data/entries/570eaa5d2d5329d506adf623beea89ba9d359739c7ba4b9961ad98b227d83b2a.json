However, as part of the continuing partnership between Apple and Hermès, the luxury watch boutique is free to continue selling ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ models with bands made of calfskin. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmong several new Hermès Single Tour and Double Tour bands made of knitted nylon and woven nylon, several color options made of calfskin can be found. Prices for Hermès ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ bands range from $349 to $589, while watch and band combinations range from $1,249 to $1,539.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the bands are available to pre-order today. Hermès will begin shipping orders after September 22, <a href=\"https://www.hermes.com/us/en/category/watches/apple-watch-hermes/#|\">according to its website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for Apple, the company on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/\">announced</a> a new textile it's calling \"FineWoven,\" which is made of 68 percent post-consumer content and is overall more environmentally friendly compared to the company's previous line of leather accessories. Apple also confirmed it will no longer use leather for new Apple accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Thanks, KPOM!</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-hermes/\">Apple Watch Hermès</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/hermes-selling-apple-watch-series-9-leather-bands/\">Hermès Debuts Apple Watch Series 9 Collection Including Leather Bands</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hermès-debuts-apple-watch-series-9-collection-including-leather-bands.2401444/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"570eaa5d2d5329d506adf623beea89ba9d359739c7ba4b9961ad98b227d83b2a","category":"Apple"}
