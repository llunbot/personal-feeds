{"title":"Apple’s move to RCS takes its first casualty: Samsung Messages","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2404788/apples-move-to-rcs-takes-its-first-casualty-samsung-messages.html","date":1721642400000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>For as long as Galaxy phones have been a thing, Samsung has been trying to make its own apps the preferred choice for users. However, the launch of RCS on the iPhone appears to have ended the dream for at least one of Samsung’s homegrown apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a community note Samsung (<a href=\"https://x.com/MaxWinebach/status/1814793653371507040\">spotted by Max Weinbach</a>), if you buy a new <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2390381/samsung-new-foldables-match-the-galaxy-s24-in-this-key-area.html\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Z Flip6 or Fold6</a>, it won’t come with the Samsung Messages app preloaded for the first time since the company’s folding phones launched in 2019. They will still be installed on non-folding Galaxy phones, but it’s just a matter of time before those phones lose the app as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard not to see the connection with the upcoming release of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2385455/rcs-iphone-ios-18-faq.html\">RCS for Messages in iOS 18</a>. Apple’s support for rich communication services won’t just “bring richer media and delivery and read receipts for those who don’t use iMessage,” it’ll let Galaxy users talk to iPhone users without feeling like second-class citizens. And Samsung understands how important that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2022, Samsung began shipping Google Messages as the <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/02/14/google-messages-samsung-galaxy-s22-us/\" target=\"_blank\">default messaging app</a> on Galaxy phones, but it still preinstalled Samsung Messages as an option. Now, at least in the U.S., users will need to specifically search for Samsung Messages in the Samsung Galaxy Store if they want to use it—which few are likely to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Samsung Messages supports RCS, the carrier support isn’t as wide as Google Messages. And if Samsung wants to keep Galaxy users upgrading (and maybe catch some switchers), the RCS experience needs to be perfect. With Google Messages, it will be as close as it can get. By removing the app from phones, Samsung ensures that users will have the best possible RCS experience when chatting with iPhone users on Galaxy phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, there’s still the issue of end-to-end-encryption, which probably <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2385455/rcs-iphone-ios-18-faq.html\">won’t be ready for launch</a> despite Apple’s efforts, but at least Galaxy users know Samsung is fully invested in making the RCS experience top-notch. Even if it means using Google Messages.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e7700ccaafb9e1d187ca56e052e270457bea4af968f85b7dda1bf775e1287dbb","category":"Apple"}
