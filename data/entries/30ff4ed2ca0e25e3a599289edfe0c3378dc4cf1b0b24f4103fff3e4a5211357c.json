Lola never really cracked Formula 1, but it did have success in IndyCar and sports car racing with cars it designed and built from the 1960s until it <a href=\"https://us.motorsport.com/wec/news/british-racing-car-constructor-lola-cars-cease-public-trading/2646692/\">ceased trading</a> in 2012. Now, under new ownership, the company has been rebuilding its engineering facilities and expertise. And together with Yamaha as its technical partner, it has chosen Formula E for its official return to professional motorsport.</p>\n<p>Formula E's dart-shaped electric single-seaters are <a href=\"https://www.the-race.com/formula-e/new-formula-e-car-2025-gen3-evo-design-concept/\">getting a bit of an update</a> before they start season 11 next year. We expect new bodywork, better tires, and perhaps the ability to use the front electric motor to send power to the wheels instead of just acting as regenerative brakes on the front axle, but those components are all spec parts, meaning every team has to use the same ones without modifying them.</p>\n<p>That goes for the battery, too, but there is freedom when it comes to the 470 hp (350 kW) electric motor that powers the rear wheels. And then there's the software, without which the car won't go anywhere.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013140#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013140&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
