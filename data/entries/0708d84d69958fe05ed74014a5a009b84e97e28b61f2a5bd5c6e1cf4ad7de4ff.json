About a month later than usual I’m considering stuffing my winter gear to the back of the wardrobe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say ‘considering’, as I just don’t trust the British climate. It might be trying to lull me into a false sense of security before yelling ‘Ha!’ and rolling backwards into winter again.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2023-week-1\">Giro d’Italia 2023 Rest Day Recap: Leader Remco Evenepoel out with Covid, stray dog and rain cause crash chaos, Ben Healy wins first Grand Tour stage</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vitus-venon-evo-all-road-bike-news\">New Vitus Venon Evo all-road bike offers road-like looks with gravel capability</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/scott-addict-history\">The complete history of the Scott Addict</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Cyclists, more than most, are attuned to the changes in the seasons. I can mark my calendar based on the thickness of gloves required for a comfortable commute to work. And while a degree or two of difference in temperature would mean nothing to most people, it will leave me wracked with indecision over whether to opt for bib shorts with kneewarmers or stick to bib tights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s rain. Has it rained (the roads will be wet)? Will it rain (maybe I should carry a rain cape)? And that’s before we get to wind speed, wind direction, amount of daylight hours, pollen count, UV intensity… in fact, I struggle to think of another pastime so affected by the vagaries of the weather. Sailing, perhaps. Or mountaineering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially true for cyclists in Britain. Our weather might not be extreme, but we’ve just got so much of it. I imagine being a weather presenter in somewhere like Spain isn’t particularly arduous – it’s summer, it’s sunny; it will be sunny tomorrow and sunny the day after that – but in Britain a forecast of sunshine is presented with the weary caution that it could turn cold/wet/windy/foggy/snowy at any moment. It’s the lack of predictability that makes every ride an exercise in planning and risk-assessment akin to starting a small business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If only there was somewhere we could go, some magical island we could escape to, where we could be certain of decent weather any time of year, and where it rained only rarely. Pristine roads, twisting climbs and spectacular views would be nice too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh well, we can but dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Patrik Lundin</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 140?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Flight of the Canaries:</strong> Gran Canaria is an island of wild contrasts. <em>Cyclist </em>heads from the southern coast up to its highest peak on a ride that takes in all landscapes and all seasons</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pursuit of perfection:</strong> His 2022 Milan-San Remo victory may have come from an unhinged descent of the Poggio, but Slovenian racer Matej Mohorič insists that his every move is scientifically calculated and driven by ‘a desire to do everything in the best possible manner’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What goes around:</strong> Debate continues to rage about whether cyclists should – or even could – adapt their pedalling style to be more efficient. <em>Cyclist </em>examines the evidence and talks to the experts to find out more</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Col du Glandon: </strong>It may often be an appetiser at the Tour but the Glandon serves up a feast</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The handmade’s tale:</strong> Thirteen years ago a mother and son started making pedal straps in their family home; today they run a bike luggage business with distribution across the globe.
