A year and a half ago we peeked inside Qvist’s unique all-new double ratchet, high-engagement <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/qvist-hub-get-double-ratchet-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">mountain bike hub concept</a>. Now we peek inside the Qvist CNC machines with idea’s man Roman Elsner – just as they are ramping up – to see how they’re made. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the up close look at high-tech precision German manufacturing. The real added bonus is that the Qvist hubs &amp; complete wheels are now available to pre-order at a 10% off discount. And many more components are on the way, too…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Qvist 3° Double Ratchet 120 POE bike hubs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Double Ratchet hubs, preorder available now, made in Germany,\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>How hard can it be to make a good bicycle hub, right? Or well, a quick high-engagement, relatively light hub that is also durable. It turns out that it is pretty tough. Qvist had a – now patented – idea for a novel adaptation of the trusted DT-style start ratchet. And they ran with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of creating smaller ratchet teeth to add more points of engagement (<em>POEs</em>), they doubled the speed of hub engagement by machining teeth offset on both sides of their main steel ratchet ring. But to do that, they pretty much had to reinvent the manufacturing method too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Double Ratchet hubs, preorder available now, made in Germany, ratchet ring detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-ring-detail-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Roman shopped the Qvist idea to existing hub makers. But none seemed set up to run with the new idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they hunted around for a manufacturing partner. And really, no one could do it for them with the existing machining setups in the bike component sphere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Qvist figured out how to design some custom tools to adapt already-established manufacturing techniques. And now are building their hubs and all the key internal elements entirely in-house. That means, they make hubshells, axles, end caps, freehub bodies, and of course those critically unique ratchet rings. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inside our Qvist Factory Tour: How hubs are made?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1012\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Factory Tour, new fast Double Ratchet hubs, preorder available now, made in Germany, cutaway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hub-cutaway-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We dropped by the new Qvist manufacturing HQ just outside of Dresden, Germany a few weeks back to see how things were moving ahead on all of the in-house production. The team hadn’t yet gone into full-scale production mode, but had been working through the final setup steps of the more complicated elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qvist’s trick to manufacturing in Germany at competitive <em>(but still premium</em>) pricing has been a lot of automated manufacturing that limits the human labor after setup. All of the hub parts are effectively being machined on three automated CNC machines – a couple of lathes and a more complex mill. Each features unique custom tooling to speed up some machining steps &amp; boost its machine’s capabilities, which we got a sneak peek inside. Plus, automated material feeds and completed parts managers to function autonomously. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Hubshells</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Factory Tour, new fast Double Ratchet hubs, made in Germany, hubshell\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_hubshell-out-of-the-mill-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting as solid bars of 7075 alloy – like all the other machined aluminum parts – the aluminum hubshells seem simple enough on the outside.

And with a separate custom tool for the teeth that guide the Double Ratchet inside the hubshell. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was pretty cool to watch, even if a bit difficult to get your brain around.

But not in conventional oil. The whole Qvist manufacturing workshop smelled surprisingly clean. And not as greasy as you normally would sense in a machine shop. Roman says that came down to the fact that they just wanted to create a more healthy environment if they were going to be working there every day. It’s maybe marginally less efficient than conventional cutting oil. But cleanup is so much easier, as is separating the machined material scrap that gets sent back for recycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Factory Tour, new fast Double Ratchet hubs, assembled ratchet rings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_main-ratchet-detail-installed-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, this final production Qvist hub boasts 120 total teeth – 60 on each side – for a quick 3° engagement angle.

Again, silver or black with HG, MicroSpline, or XDR freehubs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Superboost hub and a Single Speed hub designed for modern gearbox bikes are both in the works, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1850\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Factory Tour, new fast Double Ratchet hubs, preorder available now, made in Germany, front hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs.jpg 1850w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs-297x96.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs-800x259.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs-120x39.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs-768x249.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_front-hubs-1536x498.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image/Qvist)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Qvist also machines matching front hubs in house for 200€ a piece.

So they sourced their own carbon &amp; alloy rims. And they will custom build up road, gravel, XC, trail, or enduro wheels too in house in Germany. There are tons of options to choose from, all laced with Pillar spokes. Admittedly, Qvist sources alloy rims in Taiwan, and carbon rims in China. Apparently Qvist tested a bunch of options. And the Chinese carbon option delivered by far the best quality. Qvist are still working on a EU-made carbon option in the future too, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There really are too many options to get into detail: 18.5-26mm deep x 27-30mm internal for MTB. 25-50mm deep x 21-27mm wide internal for road &amp; gravel. The Qvist carbon rims are even available separately for 400€ a piece if you want to build your own wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s next for Qvist?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Factory Tour, new fast Double Ratchet hubs, made in Germany, more projects in development\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_ready-for-expanded-production-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Qvist are a completely new component maker with a lot of great ideas, plenty of engineering experience, solid manufacturing expertise, and a solid position in the Saxony bike manufacturing community. As we visited them in mid-December, Qvist are still in the process of ramping up production. Yet they seem to have dialed-in their unique machining processes. Even if some of the automated material handling setups weren’t quite finished yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also looks like they’ve drummed up a lot of interest with the truly unique Double Ratchet hub, over the last 18 months. So I suspect they’ll be working hard to meet initial production hub demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But their product development team isn’t sitting still. In fact, they’ve also got a 4th fancy (<em>&amp; expensive</em>) CNC machine – another lathe sitting in the workshop waiting to start producing headsets and bottom bracket cups. There’s no word on pricing, options, or availability yet. But as soon as they dial-in hub component automation, we expect to see more components getting cranked out of the Qvist workshop – just outside of Dresden, Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pre-order Discount Now</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop.jpg\" alt=\"Qvist Factory Tour, new fast Double Ratchet hubs, preorder available now online discount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Qvist-Factory-Tour_new-fast-Double-Ratchet-hubs_preorder-available-now_made-in-Germany_new-webshop-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the new hubs, rims, and wheels are available to pre-order now direct from Qvist.
