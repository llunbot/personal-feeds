It basically, just chopped off the two sides of the top of the otherwise round steerer tube (narrower at the front, wider at the back), with cables run through the upper bearing on either side of the reshaped steerer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous full-integrated design from the road had the cabling enter in front of the upper headset bearing, which required more space to allow enough handlebar rotation. And the cross and gravel bikes had conventional external/internal cables that entered the down tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2168\" height=\"1296\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta.jpeg\" alt=\"Cannondale Super Six EVO SE updates Delta\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta.jpeg 2168w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta-297x178.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta-800x478.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta-120x72.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta-768x459.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta-1536x918.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-updates-Delta-2048x1224.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the Cannondale SuperSix EVO SE/CX is in the Delta steerer tube crew, it opens up more stem and bar combo possibilities. The addition of the Conceal Stem was seen in the bikes available in the UK and Europe<em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Conceal Stem is Cannondale’s way of circumventing the one-piece super combo nightmares for cable routing. Using only a more conventional separate stem to route the cables and wires offers a sleek option for off-road. One that is adjustable for handlebar fit preference, and independently adjustable/replaceable following crashes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an added bonus, the fork loses the cable port (<em>duh</em>) and maintains a beefed-up crown area with an aggressive tapper to the dropout. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New CX/SE availability: When can you actually get it? </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2196\" height=\"1286\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red.jpeg\" alt=\"Cannondale Super Six EVO SE full red\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red.jpeg 2196w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red-297x174.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red-800x468.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red-120x70.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red-768x450.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red-1536x899.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cannondale-Super-Six-EVO-SE-full-red-2048x1199.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll likely see more of the updated Cannondale SuperSix EVO SE/CX around the US gravel scene as the races take place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revamped bikes seem to only be available selectively on some corner of Cannondale’s global website like <a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/de-de/bikes/road/gravel/supersix-evo-se\" target=\"_blank\">Germany</a> for example (<a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/en/bikes/road/gravel/supersix-evo-se/supersix-evo-se-1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>try here</em></a><em> in English</em>, too). But not on many specific USA, UK, or rest of Europe country sites. It seems to be a rolling change, so you &amp; I will both have to keep an eye out for local availability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cannondale-quietly-updates-supersix-evo-se-and-cx-with-delta-steerer-tube-hidden-cables/\">Cannondale Quietly Updates SuperSix Evo SE and CX with Delta Steerer Tube, Hidden Cables</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"66149fd0740d8426d7cac8ca0917f063f8c9994b8efdeb22df48f2a33f6062ed","category":"Cycling"}
