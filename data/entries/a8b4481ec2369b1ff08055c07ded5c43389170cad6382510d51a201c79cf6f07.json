The update will likely be released to the general public <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-18-4-next-week/\">next week</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo use the feature on iOS 18.4, open Control Center and tap on the plus sign in the top-left corner. Then, tap on \"Add a Control\" at the bottom of the screen, scroll down to the Ambient Music section, and add one or more of the controls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how Apple describes the four Ambient Music themes:<ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Music for a restful sleep.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Chill:</strong> Music for relaxation.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Music for focusing on tasks.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Wellbeing:</strong> Music for meditation and self-care.</li></ul>You can add any of the four Ambient Music controls to your Control Center, and then tap on one to start a playlist of songs that matches the theme. The feature is free and easy to use, with no Apple Music subscription or app download required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the Ambient Music feature is turned on, music controls will appear on the screen, and there is also Dynamic Island integration on newer iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are four playlists available for each theme, or you can set your own. To change the playlist, open Control Center, and then tap on the plus sign in the top-left corner of the screen. Next, tap on an Ambient Music control that you added to Control Center, and tap on the playlist name. A drop-down menu will show additional playlist options.<ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Sleep Sounds, Bedtime Beats, Sound Bath, and Piano Sleep.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Chill:</strong> Piano Chill, Ambient Chill, Lo-Fi Jazz, and Pure Chill.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> BEATstrumentals, Binaural Frequencies, Pure Focus, and Classical Concentration.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Wellbeing:</strong> Pure Meditation, Spa, Beats &amp; Breath, and Pure Calm.</li></ul>To update your iPhone to iOS 18.4, once the update is released, open the Settings app and select General â†’ Software Update.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/\">Control Center</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/27/ios-18-4-new-music-feature/\">How to Use iOS 18.4's New Ambient Music Feature in Control Center</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-use-ios-18-4s-new-ambient-music-feature-in-control-center.2454157/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a8b4481ec2369b1ff08055c07ded5c43389170cad6382510d51a201c79cf6f07","category":"Apple"}
