All but one of the announced drugs were among the top 25 costliest Medicare Part D prescriptions in 2021. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/08/drug-makers-have-tripled-the-prices-of-top-medicare-drugs/\">An analysis by AARP</a> released earlier this month found that those top 25 drugs had price increases that, on average, tripled their list prices in their time on the market and far exceeded the rate of inflation.</p>\n<p>The 10 selected today were no exception. The drugs are used by about 9 million Medicare Part D enrollees and treat various conditions, from diabetes, psoriasis, blood clots, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease to blood cancers. Based on 2021 prices, the nine drugs included in the AARP analysis were found to have list price increases averaging 262 percent in their time on the market. The average corresponding rate of inflation for the nine drugs was 64 percent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964177#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5911e4470983661a786ef1772db2530dffa732ab081366ade7a8a9de0e03cda4","category":"Tech"}
