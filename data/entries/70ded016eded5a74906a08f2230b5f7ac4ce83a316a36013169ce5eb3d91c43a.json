{"title":"Meet Your Maker Event Returns to Skyline XC in Napa, CA","link":"https://theradavist.com/meet-your-maker-skyline-xc-napa-ca/","date":1682950799000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.skylinepark.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Skyline Wilderness Park</a> in Napa has a rich history of mountain bike racing, from the Grundig World Cup races of the 1990s to the Single Speed World Championship in 2008. These are classic chunky old-school XC trails that are a perfect match for your favorite hardtail. Come test your abilities in a fun and supportive community!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://meetyourmakertour.com/rides/\" target=\"_blank\">Meet Your Maker</a> is an ongoing series of rides hosted by the Northern California bike-making community. It all started in 2011 and kinda faded out in 2016, but now it’s back! No stuffy convention halls, no dim fluorescent lighting, just a good time hanging out and talking shop while we partake in the activity that puts a big smile on all of our faces.<span></span></p>\n<p>Who will be there: Retrotec/Inglis, Sycip, Hunter, Black Cat, Neuhaus Metal Works, Paragon Machine Works, Chris Sallen, Breadwinner/Pereira, Fitz Cyclez, Outer Shell, Sim Works, and Biciclista. All are welcome and all builders are invited to bring their creations.</p>\n<p>The weekend kicks off with a group ride on Friday at 5:00 pm. There will be a course preview lap at non-race-pace, with plenty of snacks and stops along the way. Then there’s camping on Friday night. Get a good night’s sleep, because the main event happens on Saturday!</p>\n<p>The Skyline XC is a 7-mile loop with a diverse assortment of terrain types to challenge even the rowdiest rider. Beginners hit the 7-mile course one time, Intermediate and U19 take 2 laps and Expert/Pros race 3 times around the park. The race concludes with lunch, cold beverages, and a community picnic vibe under the oaks. Then there will be a bike show and podiums. After that, who knows what might happen.</p>\n<p>The proceeds from this event support the <a href=\"https://trailsalliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Redwood Trails Alliance,</a> the trail advocacy organization for Sonoma, Napa, and Lake Counties. The results of RTA’s work can be experienced throughout the region, with miles of new singletrack being built every year. With your support RTA educates, advocates, builds trails, and stewards our parks for your enjoyment and well-being.</p>\n<p>To register for the race, head over to <a href=\"https://www.rtadirtdays.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Redwood Trail Alliance Dirt Days</a>.
