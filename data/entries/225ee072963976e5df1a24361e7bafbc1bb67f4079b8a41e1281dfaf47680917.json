But long rides can hamper their performance.\n<p>The crouching forward position on a bike when held for long periods can cause shortened hip-flexor muscles. This will inhibit the work of your glutes – the direct antagonists to your hip flexors, responsible for much of your downward force and power output – and trigger back pain.</p>\n<p>But the pigeon pose will stretch out your hip flexors to keep poor pedalling technique and back pain at bay.</p>\n<p>Lie on your back with both knees bent. Place your left ankle onto your right thigh and flex your left foot, so that your left knee is pressing away from your body.</p>\n<p>To intensify the stretch, reach your hands around to grab the back of your right thigh. To come out, gently release the hold on your right leg, place both feet on the floor and sway your knees from side to side to relax your muscles.</p>\n<p>To make this harder, keep pressing your knee away from you and pull your opposite leg closer to your torso. Try reaching your arms further, so you grab your shin or use a hand to push your knee away.</p>\n<p>We have an article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/exercises-and-tips-for-avoiding-back-pain-when-cycling/\">exercises and tips to avoid back pain when cycling</a> if this is something that you struggle with.</p>\n<h3>2.

When riding a bike, you spend so much time in flexion (bent over) you need to lengthen your spine and back muscles to relieve that.\n<p>A flexible back will help you to maintain a more aero position, reduce energy leakage caused by wiggling around in your saddle and lower your injury risk.</p>\n<p>This twisting pose will lengthen, strengthen and realign your spine and help to power up your overall cycling performance.</p>\n<p>Begin by lying on your back. As you inhale, bring your right knee into your body, keeping your left leg extended. As you exhale, use your left hand on the outside of your right knee to move that knee across your body to the left-hand side.</p>\n<p>Extend your right arm out but try to keep your left shoulder on the ground. To come out, slowly bring your knee back to the centre and then extend out again.</p>\n<p>To get a deeper twist, you can rest your opposite hand on the bent knee to add a bit more weight.</p>\n<h3>3.

Inhale and lift your right arm upwards. Now exhale and thread your right arm underneath your body, reaching towards the left-hand side.</p>\n<p>Place your right shoulder on the ground and keep your right palm facing upwards. Gently bend your left elbow and press down into your left hand for a stronger twist. To come out, press down with your left hand and lift back up. Repeat on the other side.</p>\n<p>For some extra intensity, bring your supporting arm behind your body and place the back of that hand on your lower back.</p>\n<h3>4.

But if they get tight, you’re in trouble because this can impact your lower back. That’s because tight quads pull on your hip bone and drag your pelvis down, leading to postural problems.\n<p>The Anjaneyasana pose targets the quads, as well as the groin, hip flexors and glutes, to help alleviate lower back pain. Stronger quads will also balance out your hamstring muscles to develop a more fluid pedalling motion.</p>\n<p>Start in a low lunge position, with your left foot forward and your left knee in front of your left ankle. Your right knee should remain on the ground, in line with your right hip.</p>\n<p>As you inhale, shift your hips forward and activate your thigh and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-build-a-stronger-core/\">core muscles</a> for stability. Lift your right foot off the ground and grasp hold of your right ankle with your right hand.</p>\n<p>On each exhale, draw your right heel closer to your body to intensify the stretch. To come out, gently release the foot to the ground.</p>\n<p>If you’re struggling to reach your foot, try using a strap or a belt to assist. Another option is to do this by a wall so that your shin is supported.</p>\n<h3>5.

Lift your hips up, keeping a bend in your knees. Press your chest back slightly towards your thighs. Spread your fingers wide and press your weight down into your palms. Now lift out of your shoulders to create an upside-down V-shape.</p>\n<p>Depending on your hamstring flexibility, it’s likely that you will bend your knees and your heels will lift off of the floor, but over time you should be able to straighten your legs so your heels stay closer to the ground.</p>\n<p>To come out of the pose, slowly lower down onto your knees and gently roll out your wrists.</p>\n<p>If you have a wrist injury or your arms hurt, just rest your weight on your forearms instead of your hands. This is called the dolphin pose (Ardha Pincha Mayurasana).</p>\n<h3>6.

Step onto the towel or mat with the balls of your feet, keeping your heels on the ground. As you inhale, reach up with your arms.</p>\n<p>As you exhale, fold forward from your hips and reach towards the ground with your arms. Slightly bend your knees to allow your spine to lengthen. To come out again, slowly stand up, lifting your head last.</p>\n<p>This stretch works best without shoes because you can use your toes to help with your balance. To make it more challenging, shift your weight towards your toes and the stretch will feel more intense.</p>\n<h3>7.

As you inhale, reach for your opposite elbows behind your back, or – if you have the flexibility – bring your palms together behind your back.</p>\n<p>As you exhale, fold forward, lengthening your back as you lower yourself down. Keep both legs straight and active by pressing into your toes on your front foot and your heel on your back foot.</p>\n<p>To come out, press down through your feet, activate your core and slowly rise up. Repeat on the other side.</p>\n<p>A good variation is to try to place your fingertips on the floor. This will help to lengthen your spine a bit more.</p>\n<h3>8.

This stretch opens up the shoulders and the arms to counteract that effect, but you will also feel a welcome stretch in the hamstrings.\n<p>The difference with this wall version of the pose is that it focuses more on the mobility through the shoulders and upper thoracic spine than on the floor version.</p>\n<p>To do the wall version of downward-facing dog, place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, spread your fingers wide and press firmly into the wall. Take a large step back away from the wall, then fold forwards from your hips, keeping your spine straight.</p>\n<p>Keep your feet hip-distance apart and directly under your hips, and place a micro-bend into your knees. Your body should look like an L-shape. Keep your head between your arms, rather than allowing it to hang down. To come out, simply step towards the wall.</p>\n<p>To make the stretch more challenging, take one hand to the outer edge of the opposite thigh. That will give you an extra spinal twist for added mobility.</p>\n<h2>Is stretching actually useful for cyclists?</h2>\n<p>Scientists still hotly debate the topic of whether stretching is beneﬁcial for athletes, detrimental or makes no difference either way.</p>\n<p>Research on runners, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23563684_Sit-and-Reach_Flexibility_and_Running_Economy_of_Men_and_Women_Collegiate_Distance_Runners\" target=\"_blank\">published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning</a>, found that those who performed the worst in a ‘sit and reach’ test (a measure of hamstring and lower back flexibility) had the greatest running economy, a measure that could be described as their ‘miles per gallon’ rate.</p>\n<p>The theory is that tight leg, hip and trunk musculature increases elastic energy return. But there’s a major reason why the same may not apply on a bike.</p>\n<p>“Riding a bike is not something that we evolved to do,” says Mark Simpson, former lead strength and conditioning coach at the English Institute of Sport, who worked with the British Cycling team. “It’s not a natural movement like running or walking, and is more likely to cause muscular imbalances and postural changes.”</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hunched position adopted by road cyclists can lead to your muscles shortening.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As an example, the forward-leaning, crouched position adopted by roadies and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/track-cycling-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">track cyclists</a> tends to make the hip ﬂexors tighten and shorten causing an anterior pelvic tilt and an excessively arched lower back. Simpson says every cyclist he knows has this issue, but there are specific exercises to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-improve-hip-flexor-flexibility/\">improve hip flexor flexibility</a>.</p>\n<p>“Postural changes like this can lead to chronic problems such as lower back pain that will affect your daily activities, not to mention your riding, in the long-term,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Bogue agrees: “If muscles get tight, they pull on bones and put things out of alignment, increasing the risk of pain, discomfort and injury.”</p>\n<p>But poor ﬂexibility – and its consequences – don’t just give you bad posture and hike up your injury risk, your cycling performance is at stake, too.</p>\n<p>“You need a good range of motion in the hips and lower back to achieve an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/#:~:text=1.%20Learn,from%20the%20wind\" target=\"_blank\">aerodynamic time-trial position</a>,” says Graham Anderson, a physiotherapist who has worked with everyone from Olympic cyclists to amateur riders.</p>\n<p>“Without it, your power output will be reduced because you won’t be able to get maximal force from the gluteal muscles. What’s more, if you have a stiff lower back, you’ll typically overreach with the arms, putting too much weight on the hands and causing tightness across the upper back and neck.”</p>\n<p>For Simpson, who worked mainly with BMXers and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-improve-your-sprinting/\" target=\"_blank\">sprint cyclists</a>, flexibility is also important for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-training/\">cross-training</a>.</p>\n<p>“To perform a squat, for example, you need good ankle, knee and hip flexibility,” he explains. “If the ankle joint is tight, it puts too much pressure on the knee.” And if you participate in other sports, or compete in triathlon, stiff, tight muscles are not going to do your running stride or swim stroke any favours.</p>\n<p>While you may not need to be able to wrap your feet around your shoulders or bend over backwards to ride your bike, you do need to maintain – or, more likely, regain – what Simpson calls ‘normal’ range of motion in the joints, in order to ride comfortably and efficiently. This will also help you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-position/\" target=\"_blank\">improve your cycling position</a> and adapt it where necessary.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Stretching for cyclists: Q&amp;A</h2>\n<h3>When should I stretch?</h3>\n<p>Before a ride is not the best time to stretch. Your muscles are cold, making them more susceptible to injury, plus static stretching (in which you hold a ﬁxed position) can reduce power output for up to an hour.</p>\n<p>Instead, include some ‘dynamic’ stretching in your warm-up to prepare your muscles. “Take your joints through movements that replicate the range of motion you’ll be using,” advises Anderson.</p>\n<p>Bogue recommends the ‘Sun Salutation’ series from yoga because it warms up the muscles and can act as a form of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/strength-training-cycling/\">strength training</a>.</p>\n<p>After a ride, use static stretching to help restore muscles to their ‘resting’ length, or to develop length in shortened muscles.</p>\n<h3>How long should I stretch for?</h3>\n<p>You need to allow time for the ‘stretch response’ to take place, which occurs once the muscle relaxes and stops trying to protect itself from the stretch. Aim for at least 20 seconds, but 60 or more to increase flexibility.</p>\n<h3>How many stretches should I do?</h3>\n<p>The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends performing each stretch two to four times.</p>\n<h3>How far should I stretch?</h3>\n<p>“It shouldn’t be painful but there should be a little discomfort and tension,” says Anderson.</p>\n<h3>How often should I stretch?</h3>\n<p>ACSM advises flexibility training two or three times per week, and it is good to establish it as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/healthy-habits/\">habit in your training routine</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s important to take your muscles and joints through planes of movement that are neglected on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You also need to consider the joints and muscles that cycling doesn’t use.</p>\n<p>“In cycling, you’re only moving your joints in a straight line – there’s no other plane of motion, such as rotational or lateral movement,” explains Anderson. “It’s important to take your joints through these neglected ranges, too, otherwise flexibility will diminish.”</p>\n<p>While Anderson believes there is no single ‘recipe’ for optimal flexibility that suits everyone, in Bogue’s experience there are some key areas to address.</p>\n<p>“The areas which are tight in cyclists are so universal I can practically tick the boxes,” she says. Stiff quads, hip ﬂexors, hamstrings and lower backs are top of the list, accompanied by tight ‘closed’ shoulders and chest muscles.</p>\n<p>So what do we do to redress the balance? “The key thing is to reverse the cycle posture,” she says. “For example, stretches which extend the lower back are a great antidote to the ﬂexed, forward-leaning position on the bike.”</p>\n<p>A cyclist herself, Bogue has experienced the stiffness and tightness that can result from hours in the saddle, and believes yoga is the perfect complement.</p>\n<p>“It’s a way of elongating the muscles, but also it enhances your body awareness, so you notice what feels tight or stiff — and know what to do to alleviate it.”</p>","author":"Sam Murphy","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"225ee072963976e5df1a24361e7bafbc1bb67f4079b8a41e1281dfaf47680917","category":"Cycling"}
