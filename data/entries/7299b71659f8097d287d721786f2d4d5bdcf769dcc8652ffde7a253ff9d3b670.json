Because the main ‌Epic Games‌ developer account continues to be banned, Epic submitted Fortnite to the U.S. ‌App Store‌ using an account from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/epic-games-fortnite-us-app-store/\">Epic Games Sweden</a>, a subsidiary that Epic formed to create the ‌Epic Games‌ Store alternative app marketplace in the European Union.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe game was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/fortnite-submitted-to-us-app-store/\">submitted for review</a> on May 9, but after waiting over 120 hours without a response, Epic was forced to pull and resubmit its application to include the latest update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney has been vocal about his frustration with the situation, claiming that Apple has not been returning the company's calls and that the review process <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/epic-resubmits-fortnite-to-app-store/\">typically moves much faster</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBefore submitting Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said the company spoke with Apple about its plans – but never claimed Apple approved them. It remains unclear if Apple will allow Fortnite back, as the Epic v. Apple lawsuit confirmed that Apple has the right to ban Epic's account and isn't required to reinstate it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's the latest chapter in the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">legal battle</a> between the two companies, which began in 2020 when Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic implemented direct payment options that bypassed Apple's 30% commission.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe game had briefly returned to iOS devices in the EU via the Epic Games Store, but that version has now also gone offline.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/apple-blocks-fortnite-return-to-ios-app-store/\">Apple Blocks Fortnite's Return to iOS App Store, Epic Claims</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-blocks-fortnites-return-to-ios-app-store-epic-claims.2457179/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7299b71659f8097d287d721786f2d4d5bdcf769dcc8652ffde7a253ff9d3b670","category":"Apple"}
