(Editor’s note: This deal has ended and the Mac mini is now $549, a savings of $250.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Mac mini has an 8th-gen 3.6GHz Intel Core i3 Quad-Core processor, 8GB of 2666 MHz DDR4 RAM, and a 256GB PCIe SSD. For ports, it’s got four Thunderbolt 3 ports, HDMI 2.0, a pair of USB Type-A, an ethernet port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232082/799-mac-mini-review.html\">our 4-star review from 2018</a>, we called the Mac mini “an intriguing combination of performance and value” and “a no-brainer” upgrade from the previous model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the M1 Mac mini is here and the M1 Pro model is likely on the way, we don’t recommend buying this for everyday use. Rather, it would make a fantastic Plex media server or file server using <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-mini/use-mac-mini-as-a-server-apd05a94454f/mac&amp;xcust=1-1-555906-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">macOS Monterey’s built-in features</a>. There’s also macOS Server (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212886&amp;xcust=1-1-555906-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">coming soon to Monterey</a>), which offers more powerful tool for managing multiple Macs, iPads, and iPhones. Plus is one of the few Macs that let you add RAM after you buy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to beef up your home office, this Mac mini is a fantastic way to do it without breaking your bank.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c0a983c983ad1c17585ea8a27f7479ee7fd5cabc91444ff648da88837da791a3","category":"Apple"}
