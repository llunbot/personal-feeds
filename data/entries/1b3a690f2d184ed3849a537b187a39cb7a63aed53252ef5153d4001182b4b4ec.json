Under their wheels were nearly 225km of rough Flanders roads; now all that was left was a few laps of Ghent’s famously tight velodrome and a dash for glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those nine riders were some notable names: Marcel Kint, the 1938 (and because of the War, still reigning) World Champion and winner of the 1943 Paris-Roubaix; Alberic ‘Briek’ Schotte, winner in Flanders in 1942; Frans Bonduel, winner an incredible 14 years before and a three-time podium finisher in Bordeaux-Paris. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And there was the first-time entrant who would go on to become one of the finest riders of any era: a 19-year-old with thick, curly hair and dark eyebrows from Arendonk, a small town 55km east of Antwerp. His name was Rik Van Steenbergen and he just happened to be the Belgium’s reigning national champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Steenbergen had turned pro the year before – ‘Too young [to be a pro] without the benefit of a forged German identity card,’ wrote Les Woodland in <em>Cycling Heroes – The Golden Years</em>. But his professional licence was limited to the track and he only managed to get a start in the 1943 national road race that would end with him wearing the famous red, yellow and black jersey a few days before the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In those days there were three classes of rider: road-riders A, road-riders B and track riders,’ Van Steenbergen told Woodland for his 2014 book <em>Tour of Flanders – The Inside Story</em>. ‘I was registered with the federation as a track rider. At first, I wasn’t allowed to ride the national road championship in 1943. And then on the Wednesday before the race my manager, Jean Van Buggenhout, got it together that I could ride. I won, and that made me an A-class rider.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that classification meant Van Steenbergen could enter the 1944 Tour of Flanders.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-8-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>A crash, a coming together, a sprint</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Steenbergen had been active during his Flanders debut, impressing on the steep cobbled climbs and taking a share of the work when chasing those trying to break away. He was deservedly in that final group at the velodrome, seemingly bound to contest a nine-rider sprint on ’t Kuipke’s boards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet as Kint led round the final corner just outside the entrance to the velodrome his front wheel slid out from under him, sending him to the ground in a shower of grit and dust. His fall brought down the rider on his wheel, forced a couple of others to take a very wide line and left the rest to pick their way through the wreckage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two riders at the entrance to the velodrome were Georges Claes and Frans Sterckx. However, any delight they may have felt at avoiding the carnage better than their rivals was short-lived. Crowds of spectators had spilled from the packed stands, obstructing the entrance and causing the two men to come together and fall to the ground themselves.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"688\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-688x970.webp\" alt=\"Rik Van Steenbergen Tour of Flanders 1944\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-688x970.webp 688w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-213x300.webp 213w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-768x1084.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-1089x1536.webp 1089w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-1452x2048.webp 1452w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-750x1058.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen-1140x1608.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/history-van-steenbergen.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Offside/L'Equipe</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That left the way clear for Van Steenbergen to fight it out with Schotte in the final sprint. Here, Van Steenbergen’s prowess on the track – he would become national champion in the omnium and pursuit disciplines later in the year – paid dividends and he held off the 1942 winner by half a length to win his first Classic, leaving Schotte looking somewhat nonplussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘So here we are with a new Belgian favourite for Paris-Roubaix,’ reported <em>L’Auto</em> two days later. ‘And what a favourite: a tall and friendly 19-year-old boy… with an elegant figure despite his 183 centimetres and 80 kilos, with curly hair that escapes in tufts on each side of his cap, with a straight gaze and a boyish smile.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Steenbergen’s victory made him the youngest winner of the Tour of Flanders, a record he holds to this day. He would indeed go on to ride Paris-Roubaix the following week but failed to finish after suffering a mechanical. However, his 1944 Tour of Flanders win would be just the start of an incredible road racing career that would bring a second Flanders win (1946), two Paris-Roubaix victories (1948, 1952), Milan-San Remo (1954) and three national championships (1943, 1945, 1954).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His 1952 Paris-Roubaix win ahead of Fausto Coppi – the pair duelling all the way into Roubaix – is legendary. Coppi, knowing he wouldn’t beat the Belgian in a sprint, attacked time and again only for the unyielding Van Steenbergen to stay with the Italian to the track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I knew at that moment that I had lost Paris-Roubaix,’ Coppi reflected afterwards while Van Steenbergen countered that one more attack by Coppi would probably have broken him.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-of-flanders\">How to watch the Tour of Flanders 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the Tour of Flanders 2025?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-preview\">Tour of Flanders 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch, start lists and history</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘Still the most severe and still the most beautiful race,’ <em>L’Équipe</em> reported. ‘To triumph over the great Fausto Coppi it needed a dazzling Van Steenbergen.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even given that remarkable race, perhaps Van Steenbergen’s most notable achievements over the course of his 23-year professional career were the three World Championships Road Race wins he recorded in 1949, 1956 and 1957. At the time it made him only the second man in history to win three rainbow jerseys on the road – Alfredo Binda being the first – and remains a feat only matched since then by three men – Eddy Merckx, Óscar Freire and Peter Sagan – and never bettered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Steenbergen retired in 1966 with a celebration at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, where 20,000 well-wishers turned up on a December night to mark one of the great pro cycling careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘On Saturday evening a packed Antwerp Sportpaleis said goodbye to Rik Van Steenbergen, who participated in an omnium race for the last time, after a cycling career of a quarter of a century,’ reported the <em>Leidsch Dagblad</em> newspaper. Van Steenbergen, watched by ‘numerous champions from the past and present’, among them Rik Van Looy, Eddy Merckx, Gino Bartali, Yvonne Yeynders and, yes, Briek Schotte, fittingly won his final race ahead of Jean Stablinski before the presentation ceremony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘An extravagant gift was undoubtedly the ten hectares of land on Sardinia that was offered to Van Steenbergen, whose love for real estate is well known,’ noted <em>Leidsch Dagblad</em>. Not a bad retirement present.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rik-van-steenbergen-tour-of-flanders\">Pro race history: Van Steenbergen wins the 1944 Tour of Flanders aged 19</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1b3a690f2d184ed3849a537b187a39cb7a63aed53252ef5153d4001182b4b4ec","category":"Cycling"}
