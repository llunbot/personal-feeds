You get the Sage Droptimator, a drop bar mountain bike that’s equal parts fast and fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Sage Titanium founder Dave Rosen, it’s a “purpose-built singletrack shredder that’s wicked fast on the roads, too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>OK, but why?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-1.webp\"><img

with their modified mountain bikes,” says Rosen, “I wondered what a drop-bar mountain bike would look like if it were <em>actually</em> designed with that cockpit and short travel fork in mind.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\"

and Storm King gravel bike. The frame is made in the USA using their 3/2.5 titanium tubing with 3D-printed titanium dropouts and chainstay yoke. Like the Optimator, it’ll clear 29×2.4 XC tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of sage droptimator drop bar mountain bike headtube.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a 69º head angle, splitting the difference between the Optimator’s slack 67.5º HA and Storm King gravel bike’s 70.5º HA.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1313\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-3.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of sage droptimator drop bar mountain bike cockpit.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-3.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-3-297x195.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-3-1536x1008.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-3-120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-3-768x504.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The headtube and top tube are shortened, and it’s paired with a negative-rise stem over a 100mm XC fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8.webp\" alt=\"sage droptimator drop bar mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sage-droptimator-drop-bar-mountain-bike-8-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined, it puts the rider in a faster, more aero “gravel” riding position, but with 29×2.4″ tires and shreddy handling to tackle the singletrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have my own Droptimator built up and it’s so much fun,” he adds. “I knew I had to offer this as a special edition.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Droptimator Pricing &amp;

It’ll be sold only as a frameset with frame, fork, and headset.
