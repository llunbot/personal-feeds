The team only managed 16 victories, two coming from stages at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>, one at the Amstel Gold Race, and an overall win at the Tour de Romandie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some big names have already departed, but the team are looking towards developing youth as they aim to make their way back to success. The future could be bright, but it may take a bit of time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Revolving doors</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/20240406PRX0158-A.S.O._Jonathan_Biche-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Jonathan Biche</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest name missing from 2025 will be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a>. Despite sprinting to Ineos’s biggest one-day win of the year in the Amstel Gold Race, things started to sour when he was deselected from the team’s Il Lombardia lineup. Teammate Geraint Thomas said at the time that people around Pidcock ‘didn’t help’, admitting that ‘the fact is that he had a great chance of performing today’. Their reportedly highest-paid rider has since stepped down from the WorldTour to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-q36-5-pros-cons\" target=\"_blank\">sign with Q36.5 ProCycling</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also departing is Jhonatan Narváez, who’s off to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>. The Ecuadorian Road Race Champion won one of Ineos Grenadiers’ two Grand Tour stages this season, being the only man not named Tadej Pogačar to wear the <em>maglia rosa</em> at the Giro d’Italia. British Road Race Champion Ethan Hayter is also leaving to go to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a>, with his brother Leo taking a break from cycling to look after his mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Months of speculation preceded the announcement that Steve Cummings would leave his director of racing role after eagle eyes clocked his absence at big races this season. He’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-amstel-nato\" target=\"_blank\">now at Jayco-AlUla</a> as a <em>directeur sportif. </em>Head coach Xabier Artetxe has also departed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some staff are leaving, replacements have been brought in already. Tom Hellemen takes up the post of lead performance coach having previously been a coach at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\">DSM-Firmenich-PostNL</a>. Dr Mehdi Kordi, a track and sprint specialist who led the Dutch national team to multiple gold medals at the Paris Olympics, becomes head of performance support and innovation, and Dr Luca Oggiano, an aerodynamicist who has worked with the team for a decade including on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/filippo-ganna-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Filippo Ganna’s Hour record</a>, becomes director of research and development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea seems to be that Ineos Grenadiers will continue to focus on Grand Tours, stage races and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a> – so pretty much everything – but with an emphasis on developing the talent of the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2171723769.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>Alex Broadway/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That new talent includes 20-year-old American U23 ITT champion Artem Schmidt. He joins British rider Samuel Watson, a former U23 national champion who raced to his first pro win this year for Groupama-FDJ at the Tour de Wallonie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Axel Laurance has also signed for Ineos after winning his first WorldTour race at the Volta a Catalunya. It comes a year after he took victory in the men’s U23 World Championships with a 26km solo breakaway. They join other young riders such as AJ August and Theodore Storm, already on the squad, plus the more experienced Lucas Hamilton from Jayco-AlUla and Bob Jungels from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus on youth is a change of direction for a team that used to buy big names on big salaries, but as performance director Scott Drawer said recently, ‘If we’re going to win Grand Tours again, our investment and work has to be on young talent.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>With the times</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2176361826-970x643.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2176361826-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2176361826-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2176361826-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2176361826-750x497.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2176361826-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/GettyImages-2176361826.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>Christian Kaspar-Bartke/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing the focus on youth, Ineos Grenadiers finally have a development team. This comes some time after other WorldTour squads such as DSM, whose development team was founded in 2017, Groupama-FDJ in 2019 and Visma-Lease a Bike in 2020. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> have also already partnered with Continental squads for development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team announced the news in November that their development partnership was to be with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-lizzie-deignan-retirement\" target=\"_blank\">German Continental team Lotto-Kern Haus-PSD Bank </a>from 2025. It’s an expansion of the team’s internal young talent identifying programme it calls ‘Ascent’, which resulted in time-trial extraordinaire Josh Tarling’s signing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A development team is important as it helps further prepare young riders for WorldTour racing instead of throwing them straight in the deep end. New signing Axel Laurance came up through the B&amp;B Hotels-KTM and Alpecin-Deceuninck development teams. Other recent success stories away from Ineos include Olav Kooij, Visma-Lease a Bike’s sprinter, and French Road Race Champion Paul Lapeira.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

haven’t won a Grand Tour since <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/egan-bernal\" target=\"_blank\">Egan Bernal</a> at the Giro d’Italia in 2021. He’s still on the team yet isn’t racing with the same expectations following his training ride crash in 2022 and lengthy recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlos Rodríguez has been a rider to watch for a couple of seasons with top ten finishes at both the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>. The 23-year-old won the Tour de Romandie and finished second at the Itzulia Basque Country in 2024. He is undoubtably their biggest current hope in terms of Grand Tours and Ineos have pinned their hopes on furthering his development over the coming seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filippo Ganna, stage winner at the Giro d’Italia this season, and other big names such as Michał Kwiatkowski and Laurens de Plus remain. There’s still a British presence in the team with six riders in Ben Swift, Connor Swift, Josh Tarling, Geraint Thomas, Ben Turner and Sam Watson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average age of the team will be 28. Their youngest riders include AJ August, Peter Øxenberg and Theodor Storm who are all 20 years old and can learn from some of the wise heads in the team such as Geraint Thomas (39), Ben Swift and Jonathan Castroviejo (both 38).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not a complete overhaul, with many familiar faces hanging around, but the team once again feels as though it is in a transition period switching to focus on developing the next generation of talent as opposed to being immediately where they would like to be, which is on the top step of the podium again. It’s a different strategy to how they’ve done things in the past, but the previous formula was not working, and with the top of the sport including Tadej Pogačar, Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel, it would take something special to get back into the yellow jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one is expecting Ineos Grenadiers to be heading into their best season in 2025 after coming off the back of a year that was their worst to date. They won’t be challenging in Grand Tours against <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>, but they should be winning more than two stages across a combined nine weeks. The immediate focus is now on development and fostering ‘home grown’ talents with the future hopefully bringing a return to  their former success.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-season-review-2024-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 120: 2024 pro season review + 2025 predictions with Felix Lowe</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-q36-5-pros-cons\">What are the pros and cons of Tom Pidcock’s move to Q36.5?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tom-pidcock-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 119: Tom Pidcock talks 2025 focus, Olympic ups and downs, descending and more</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">Pro cycling transfers 2024/2025: Elisa Longo Borghini finally confirms move to UAE Team ADQ, Kasper Asgreen signs for EF and Tom Pidcock rumoured to join second-division Q36.5</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/wheeling-and-dealing-how-pro-transfers-get-done\">Wheeling and dealing: how pro transfers get done</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-ineos-grenadiers\">What does the future look like for Ineos Grenadiers?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"12caf03fbd581953f78f3eedc8d768c20695ec3c8f867f9a32262bc76da65eb1","category":"Cycling"}
