There are 24 oxidizer valves in the propulsion system, which is critical both for in-space travel as well as launch emergency escapes.</p>\n<p>Boeing has been able to open nine of the valves, said John Vollmer, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program. The other four remain stuck. As a result, the company plans to de-stack the Starliner spacecraft from its Atlas V rocket and move it to the nearby Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility for deeper troubleshooting.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787128#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787128&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0911e164806958f8ca04ab1d5d2546d7cfc0e4b6598b7a33ca15a2ecdab19d12","category":"Tech"}
