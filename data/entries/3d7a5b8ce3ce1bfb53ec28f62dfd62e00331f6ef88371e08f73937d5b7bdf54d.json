Intel also says Asus will \"manufacture, sell, and support\" current NUC systems using 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th-generation Intel processors.</p>\n<p>We've reached out to Intel to see whether this means that current NUC owners should contact Asus for warranty, driver, and BIOS support going forward. It sounds like Intel will continue to handle warranty support for now, though this may change by the end of the three-year warranty period that covers most NUCs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955004#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955004&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3d7a5b8ce3ce1bfb53ec28f62dfd62e00331f6ef88371e08f73937d5b7bdf54d","category":"Tech"}
