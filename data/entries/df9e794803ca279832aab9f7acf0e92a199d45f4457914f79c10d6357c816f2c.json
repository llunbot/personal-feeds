Once installed, ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> by going to General &gt; Software update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌. It's not recommended to install ‌‌‌watchOS 8‌‌‌ on a main Apple Watch as the software may be unstable at this early date.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's no word yet on what's new in watchOS 8.1, but we'll update this article when we know more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-8/\">watchOS 8 </a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-mac-tvos-watchos-programming.135\">iOS, Mac, tvOS, watchOS Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/apple-seeds-watchos-8-1-beta-1-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds First Beta of watchOS 8.1 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-watchos-8-1-to-developers.2312393/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=u0YLmpeDw-c:RB_uLioAfrY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=u0YLmpeDw-c:RB_uLioAfrY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/u0YLmpeDw-c\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df9e794803ca279832aab9f7acf0e92a199d45f4457914f79c10d6357c816f2c","category":"Apple"}
