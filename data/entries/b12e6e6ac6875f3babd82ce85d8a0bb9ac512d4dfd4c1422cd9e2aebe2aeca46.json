The company declared the June 5 test a success because the engine performed nominally and will be fired up again soon.</p>\n<p>\"Data point one is that the engine is still there,\" said Andy Lapsa, chief executive of the Washington-based launch company, in an interview with Ars.</p>\n<p>The test took place at the company's facilities in Moses Lake, Washington. Seven of these methane-fueled engines, each intended to have a thrust of 100,000 pounds of force, will power the company's Nova rocket. This launch vehicle will have a lift capacity of about 5 metric tons to orbit. Lapsa declined to declare a target launch date, but based on historical developmental programs, if Stoke continues to move fast, it could fly Nova for the first time in 2026.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030683#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030683&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b12e6e6ac6875f3babd82ce85d8a0bb9ac512d4dfd4c1422cd9e2aebe2aeca46","category":"Tech"}
