You guide Desta through anxious dreams that are, very conveniently, expressed as grid-based, turn-by-turn dodgeball fights. Can you resolve the guilt of falling out of touch with your best friend from high school by pulling off the perfect bank shot off their dome, catching the ball on the rebound, then hitting them again? In <em>Desta</em>, you can, and I swear it works.</p>\n<p>It helps that developer ustwo brings all its powers to bear on <em>Desta</em>'s dreamy visuals, evocative soundtrack, and wonderful spoken dialogue. You could ignore the narrative if you wanted to get straight to the increasingly complicated battlefields—the story bits are short and direct and easy to skip. But I'd bet that you'll get pulled in.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934607#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934607&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a0dd24bf061cf63046a68de6447ef01335e4b0822ba51b8e23f89a3a5009b60c","category":"Tech"}
