Instead of requiring a lot of attention, a notification can appear briefly, is easily dismissed, and can be controlled—you can suppress apps from showing them all together, all the way to allowing Critical Alerts in some apps for events you absolutely don’t want to miss a message about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple gingerly added push notifications to Safari in macOS to let websites access the system-wide notification system because the increasing reliance on web apps (a website that provides an app-like set of features) means you could have a tab open performing tasks that require your attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a double-edged sword, though: spammers, scammers, and assorted thieves and ne’er-do-wells take advantage of any opening to try to part you from your money through lies and fear. A malicious site can leverage push notifications to fill the right edge screen with unwanted alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can this happen? You visit a safe site that, through the vagaries of ad networks, is hosting an advertisement that either you click on without realizing the danger or the bad ad runs illegitimate JavaScript to force open a window or prompt you to open one. You might also visit a URL for a site that has been hijacked or failed to renew its domain registration, and now you’re on a page of no repute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However you get there, a malicious site incorporates a request in the page you load that triggers Safari to prompt you to ask if you want to enable notifications for the site or not. This is harder to trigger in iOS and iPadOS, which only allow notifications from web pages <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-sa/guide/iphone/iph42ab2f3a7/ios&amp;xcust=1-1-2110589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">you’ve added to your home screen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Misleading messages on macOS Safari</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple first introduced the feature to macOS, it only allowed developers to trigger a standard dialog box that said Don’t Allow and Allow, with Allow highlighted. Not long after, Safari began to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.pushengage.com/how-to-configure-subscription-optin-box/&amp;xcust=1-1-2110589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">allow a custom opt-in message and design</a>. The text that appears <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.mcafee.com/support/?locale=en-US&amp;articleId=TS102999&amp;page=shell&amp;shell=article-view&amp;xcust=1-1-2110589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">can be entirely misleading</a>: it’s possible that you would click a button intending to not allow alerts and actually have opted in to them. For instance, the text that misled one Macworld reader says:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[space]ask you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confirm that you’re not a robot, you need click Allow</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I must have been taken in once because I found this entry in <em>Apple menu &gt; System Settings &gt; Notifications</em> on my Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as the web page remains open, even if it’s in a window or tab you’re not viewing, it can send you notifications. Because Apple shows the favicon of the website (a small icon set by the site owner), as part of the notification, it can be quite misleading. For example, in the figure below, the favicon is a System Preferences icon with a red dot overlaid. That gives the impression it’s a macOS notification but it’s not.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-malicious-notifications.png?w=1200\" alt=\"macOS malicisous notifications\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-malicious-notifications.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1702w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-malicious-notifications.png?resize=300%2C240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-malicious-notifications.png?resize=768%2C614&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-malicious-notifications.png?resize=1200%2C959&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac911-malicious-notifications.png?resize=1536%2C1227&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"959\" /><figcaption><p>A reader sent these screens of malicious notifications from the “Ask You” site.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Glenn Moyer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking the notification takes you to the web page trying to sucker you, and then the site tries to lure you into installing malware, typing in your credit-card number, or much worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that said, you can easily defeat the creeps who set you up by disabling notifications.
