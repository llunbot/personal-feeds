{"title":"Legal Nerdery on Trump’s TikTok Executive Order","link":"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump's-tiktok-executive-order-and-the-limits-of-executive-non-enforcement","date":1737578269000,"content":"\n<p>Alan Rozenshtein, writing for Lawfare:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While Apple and Google maintained their compliance, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/19/nx-s1-5267568/tiktok-back-online\">Oracle and\nAkamai made the remarkable decision to resume services</a>,\ndespite facing potentially catastrophic liability rates. Shortly\nafter his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump followed through by\n<a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-orders-75-day-pause-on-tiktok-law-enforcement\">issuing an executive order</a> that suspended PAFACAA\nenforcement for 75 days and attempted to provide retroactive\nprotection for any violations before and during the\nnonenforcement period.</p>\n\n<p>TikTok’s tech partners face a key executive power question: Can\nthey rely on Trump’s promises not to enforce PAFACAA? If companies\ncontinue providing services to TikTok, can Trump later change his\nmind and pursue enforcement actions against them for all\naccumulated violations? Could a future administration enforce\nthese violations regardless of Trump’s current promises? The\nstakes are enormous — nearly a trillion dollars in potential\nliability. Unfortunately for the companies, established legal\ndoctrine suggests that they are making a remarkably risky bet on\nboth the scope and durability of executive non-enforcement\npromises.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we are on Wednesday and ByteDance apps remain out of both Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/legal-nerdery-on-trumps-tiktok-executive-order\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c346b889f7b6fbd66b5f28bc681df2b9fbda91d186d19e1082ed601a6058a718","category":"Tech"}
