At the end of the bar’s life, or ultimately if you manage to break it, Forge+Bond’s nylon polymer can be heated up to a high temperature, and the carbon itself can be separated from the binder for recycling. That’s one of the biggest benefits of Forge+Bond FusionFiber, just like in their carbon rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>OK, now why do we want more mountain bike bar flex?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control.jpg\" alt=\"Forge and Bond 25 MTN vibration-damping FusionFiber carbon mountain bike handlebar, riding with improved comfort &amp; control, and reduced fatigue\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_riding-with-more-comfort-and-control-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Can we all agree that with the shift to 35mm diameter mountain bike handlebars, a lot of bars actually became too stiff? I know everyone talks about stiffness being the goal of premium bars. But to me, it’s been like a decade and 1″ clamps since I had a real problem with a mountain bike bar that was too flexible to the extent that it lessened the enjoyment of my ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I’m totally intrigued by Forge+Bond’s claims of improved rider comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_comfortable-35mm-MTB-riser-bar-fron-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_comfortable-35mm-MTB-riser-bar-fron-view.jpg\" alt=\"Forge and Bond 25 MTN vibration-damping FusionFiber carbon mountain bike handlebar, 800mm wide by 25mm rise\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_comfortable-35mm-MTB-riser-bar-fron-view.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_comfortable-35mm-MTB-riser-bar-fron-view-297x59.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_comfortable-35mm-MTB-riser-bar-fron-view-120x24.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar_comfortable-35mm-MTB-riser-bar-fron-view-768x154.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Forge+Bond crafts their new carbon 25 MTN bar from their FusionFiber thermoplastic composite held together with long-chain nylon polymers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar-is-not-made-with-epoxy-resin.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar-is-not-made-with-epoxy-resin.jpg\" alt=\"Forge and Bond 25 MTN vibration-damping FusionFiber carbon mountain bike handlebar, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar-is-not-made-with-epoxy-resin.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar-is-not-made-with-epoxy-resin-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar-is-not-made-with-epoxy-resin-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar-is-not-made-with-epoxy-resin-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Forge-and-Bond-25-MTN-vibration-damping-carbon-mountain-bike-handlebar-is-not-made-with-epoxy-resin-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Forge+Bond don’t give away too much of their proprietary manufacturing tech.
