The November security update for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is build number \"SD1A.210817.036,\" which this most recent fingerprint update increments by one, to end up with build \"SD1A.210817.03<strong>7</strong>.\" Google hasn't officially said what the build does, but <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/support/google-pixel-6-pro-update/\">Verizon</a> posted a changelog for build 037, which says: \"The current software update improves the performance of your device's fingerprint sensor.\"</p>\n<p>The update is 14.5MB if you're coming from the November security patch. Not everyone was having problems with the fingerprint sensor, but <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qw3lfb/looks_like_the_new_update_fixed_the_fingerprint/\">the thread</a> about it on the /r/GooglePixel subreddit seems to have mostly positive impressions after installing. It feels like the update is on a pretty slow rollout. Even if you're on the older build, pressing the \"check for update\" buttonÂ <em>won't</em> pull it down automatically like normal. The OTA is available for manual download on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/android/ota\">Google's Pixel site</a>, so your options are to manually apply it (instructions are at the top of that page) or wait longer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814021#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814021&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b7c250da3a1db171ae57eb857c9aca2d9ba25900135308e68108e58ea794f7a","category":"Tech"}
