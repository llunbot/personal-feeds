Today’s leak puts the spotlight on the iPhone 17 Air—and it’s more than ready for its closeup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1909608510532239362\">a post by leaker Majin Bu on X</a>, we get to see the iPhone 17 Air in the flesh and it looks incredibly thin. For reference, Bu holds it next to an iPhone 16e—which is only 7.8 mm—and the 17 Air appears to be about half the thickness, as you can see below.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iphone 16e next to an leaked iPhone 17 Air\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-16e-17-air-leak-comparison2.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone 16e (top) looks downright bulky compared to the iPhone 17 Air dummy models.</p></figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1909608510532239362\" target=\"_blank\">Majin Bu/X</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, the phone does have a fairly sizable camera bump, but the new design, which spreads the array across the entire top of the phone, helps make it less bulbous and more visually appealing. The phone is shown in black with a camera array that matches the body of the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve such thinness, Apple will reportedly need to make <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2533217/iphone-17-air-design-revealed-5-6mm-aluminum-case-single-camera-more.html\">several sacrifices</a> inside the phone. For one, there will only be a single camera, which Bu’s images show. Additionally, Apple is expected to use a smaller battery, and eliminate the bottom speaker. Of course, Apple will also offer iPhone 17 and 17 Pro models for people who prioritise these features over the design of the 17 Air, but if it looks this good, quite a few people are going to be willing to make the tradeoff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> at an event in September. It will reportedly cost the same $899 as the iPhone 16 Plus, but with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2660512/president-trump-us-tariffs-impact-apple-products-price.html\">tariffs</a> going into effect this month, it’s hard to predict what prices will be.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1d4e98cc3c5bbeae85e835be5bdbacf83feebffd1125b384e597cf4a545f1368","category":"Apple"}
