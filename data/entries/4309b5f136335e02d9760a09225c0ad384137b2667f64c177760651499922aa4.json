Keen on both but can’t decide which one is right for you? In this detailed comparison we’ll break down the key differences between the two bikes, making the Grail vs Grizl decision an easier one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grail had a major update in October 2023, which transformed it from the original all-rounder gravel bike launched in 2018 into an out-and-out gravel race bike. To scratch the competitive itch, there’s now a high spec CFR (for Canyon Factory Racing) frameset, which drops the claimed weight of a complete bike to as low as 8kg. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emerging from deep in the woods, Canyon’s Grizl is a chunkier gravel bike with a wilder streak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grizl launched in May 2021, featuring bigger tyres, more mounting points, and some builds that include a suspension fork – all of which suggested it was being aimed at more extreme kinds of off-road riding than the original 2018 Grail. It doesn’t quite match the Grail CFR’s low weight, with Canyon’s lightest build quoted at 8.86kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, two gravel bikes with different priorities. But which is right for you – the latest Canyon Grail or the Canyon Grizl?

clearance and mudguard compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002314/canyon-bikes-grizl-family-06-970x546.jpeg\" alt=\"canyon-bikes-grizl-family-06\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Grail comes with 40mm tyres and can accept tyres up to 42mm wide. The Grizl comes with 45mm tyres and can accept alternatives up to 50mm wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both bikes make use of Schwalbe’s G-One tyres. However, the Grail favours the faster-rolling G-One RS, while the Grizl uses the knobblier G-One Bite for better grip in loose conditions. (Note: some Grail models are equipped with G-One R tyres, while the Grail CF SLX 8 has Pirelli Cinturato tyres).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyre clearance is a good indicator of how far you can push a bike on more extreme trails. Wider tyres provide more grip, better cushioning, and can be run softer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, they’re heavier and generate more rolling resistance, something especially noticeable on smoother surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikes will come with a particular size tyre fitted, and most brands will also suggest a maximum that the bike can accommodate. It’s worth considering that you might want to use some of the space between these two numbers for mudguards (fenders) – both the Grail and Grizl accept Canyon’s proprietary mudguards (but not standard guards, unless you’re prepared to get creative with mounting solutions).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs Grail: Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grail 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505698-CANYON-GRAIL-05-979753-original-1696329161-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Frame geometry</a> describes the angles and other measurements that make up the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without delving too deep into the details, bikes often tend towards feeling either nimble or stable. A nimble and reactive bike feels great when whipping around a flat corner but less fun when rattling down a loose and rocky trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the more rugged the terrain, the more you’ll appreciate stability over nimbleness. However, take this too far and the bike can feel sluggish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To adapt a popular phrase, pick a horse (or bicycle) suited in stature to the prevailing conditions, and you’ll be onto a winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do the Grizl and Grail stack up? Both bikes are relatively upright in the interests of comfort and a slightly more rearward distribution of their rider’s weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both also have reasonably long wheelbases for stability, and a mountain bike-esque combination of long top tubes and short stems. Head angles and bottom bracket drops are almost the same on both bikes, although Canyon has followed the modern trend and relaxed the head tube angle on the new Grail from its predecessor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon quotes ‘Stack+’ and ‘Reach+’ for its bikes, which take into account the dimensions of the bar and stem. It’s useful for comparisons within Canyon’s own range, but less helpful elsewhere as few other brands adopt this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although on the basis of their frame stack and reach, the Grail looks taller than the Grizl, as we’ll see in the next section, its bar design means that its Stack+ is significantly lower than the Grizl and its Reach+ a little longer across the size range. This promotes a more aero ride position with more even weight distribution between the front and rear wheels, as befits a bike designed for faster riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs Grail: Handlebars</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grail 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/505727-DSC02920-44e4d8-original-1696329450-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Grail’s double decker handlebar has been replaced in the new Grail by the Double Drop bar in the interests of aerodynamics – Canyon claims to see a 9.1 watts saving at 45kph in its wind tunnel testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Double Drop bar slopes downward from the stem to the brake levers, which lowers the rider’s frontal profile. The single piece design means that you can’t easily change effective stem length or bar width, but Canyon offers a 40mm wide bar as an aftermarket option, again in the interest of lowering wind resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon sells aero extensions and a range of accessories which can be fitted to the Double Drop bar to make you even more aero or set the bike up for night riding or with a bike computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, the Grizl uses a more traditional drop handlebar setup with a separate stem, albeit in fancy carbon fibre on more expensive models. This means that it’s a lot easier to change stem length or bar width and that you can change the angle of the bars to make it more comfortable for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither the Grail nor the Grizl features the massively wide flared bars now popular with some gravel riders. The argument for such designs is better handling for technical off-road riding. The disadvantage is they’re less well-suited to road riding, the angle of the brake levers can feel awkward and to some eyes they are more aesthetically challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs. Grail: Frame mounts for bikepacking and touring</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002321/canyon_grizle_bikepacking-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon_grizle_bikepacking\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying stuff in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking bags</a> or via a rack and panniers is crucial for many gravel riders. In this way, the Grail and Grizl differ significantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grail continues its focus on fast riding with its storage options. As with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-endurace-review\" target=\"_blank\">Endurace</a>, there’s internal frame storage for repair tools, although in the Grail this is in the down tube, rather than its top tube position in the Endurace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon backs this up with a larger storage bag that fits behind the head tube and is held in place magnetically. It claims that this makes the bike more aero, as it acts as a fairing, as well as adding some extra carrying space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon also includes mounts for a bag on the Grail’s top tube. You can add even more storage by using its Load Fork Sleeves, which slide over the fork legs and allow you to bolt on up to 6kg of extra luggage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do get a third water bottle mount on the down tube, plus those hidden mudguard mounts, but that’s it. Having said that, for a bike designed for fast riding the Grail is surprisingly versatile and beats much of the gravel race bike competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grizl has similar load-carrying capacity, but the non-suspension fork legs come pre-equipped with mounting hardware. Choose a suspension fork model and you’ll only have the option of a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\" target=\"_blank\">bar bag</a> to load up at the front end. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon has even gone so far as commissioning a unique set of bags from bikepacking expert Apidura for the Grizl. Add in the extra squish provided by the broader tyres and more upright position and the Grizl is the better choice of loaded off-road touring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs Grail: Dropper compatibility and suspension</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon_grizl_suspension\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What is a dropper post, and why might you want one on a gravel bike? An import from the mountain bike segment, a dropper post is a seatpost you can lower via a switch (or ‘remote’) on the handlebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is useful as it allows you to swap between an effective saddle height for pedalling and a lower saddle height for tackling scary sections requiring more standover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the original Grail had Canyon’s split shaft VCLS seatpost, the new Grail has a 42g lighter, aero D-shaped one-piece post based on that used for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/canyon-ultimate-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate </a>road bike, but with a little extra flex. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher spec Grizls have the VCLS seatpost, while lower specs have a standard round post. Currently, only the Grizl CF SL 8 Trail has a dropper post as standard. However, the rest of the Grizl range does have the necessary ports on the frame to fit one later if you desire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, a suspension fork is what you’ll find on the most trail-focussed Grizl builds. These models use Rockshox’s slimmed-down Rudy fork to provide 30mm of travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making for a supremely smooth ride, whether the extra weight, cost, and ongoing maintenance commitment are worth it will depend on your own preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl and Grail Ranges compared</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Grizl comes in multiple aluminium and carbon versions, the Grail is for now carbon only. Canyon is currently still selling the Grail:On e-bike, based on the first generation Grail and boasting its double deck handlebars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect, the five-bike Grail range starts at higher prices than the alloy Grizls, although carbon framed Grizl CF SL and CF SLX bikes are comparable in price to the Grail CF SL and CF SLX. The Grail CFR bikes add a more expensive tier above this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grail CF SL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon Grail 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-sl-7-etap-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry point to the new Grail range, the Grail CF SL is available in three specs, ranging from the Grail CF SL 7, currently priced at £2,599 and with a Shimano GRX 2× 12-speed groupset, via the £2,899 Grail CF SL 8 with a 1× GRX groupset to the Grail CF SL 7 AXS which has a 1× SRAM Rival XPLR AXS groupset. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grail CF SLX</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-970x648.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon Grail 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-970x648.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-2048x1367.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-750x501.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-1140x761.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/grail-cf-slx-8-etap-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grail CF SLX is available in two specs.

The range hits its zenith at £3,349, with the (non-suspension) Grizl CF SL 8 1by Ekar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grizl CF SLX</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/full_2023_3787_grizl-cf-slx-8-etap-sus_P05_P5-970x545.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grizl CF SLX 8 Force AXS Trail\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/full_2023_3787_grizl-cf-slx-8-etap-sus_P05_P5-970x545.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/full_2023_3787_grizl-cf-slx-8-etap-sus_P05_P5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/full_2023_3787_grizl-cf-slx-8-etap-sus_P05_P5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/full_2023_3787_grizl-cf-slx-8-etap-sus_P05_P5-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/full_2023_3787_grizl-cf-slx-8-etap-sus_P05_P5-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/full_2023_3787_grizl-cf-slx-8-etap-sus_P05_P5.jpg 1300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SLX line represents the very fanciest iteration of the Grizl platform – there’s no CFR frameset. You’ll get a frame popped out of the same mould as the cheaper bikes but using fancier carbon and a slightly different layup process for a claimed 950g frame weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With three options available, you’ll also have to decide on the direction you want to take with the bike. The Grizl CF SLX range’s lowest priced offering is the CF SLX 8 eTap Trail, with a SRAM Force XPLR AXS groupset and a sticker price of £4,999 but discounted to £4,519. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grizl CF SLX 8 Di2 has a Shimano 2× electronic groupset and is priced at £4,799. Finally, the Grizl CF SLX Force AXS Trail is priced at £5,099. As well as the eponymous 1× groupset, there’s a power meter and front suspension in the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Grizl vs Grail: Which is the best gravel bike?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002352/canyon-bikes-grizl-sl-01-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon-bikes-grizl-sl-01\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice between the Grizl and Grail is much less nuanced than it used to be: if you want to go fast, choose the Grail; if you want to head to more technical terrain, choose the Grizl. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Price-wise, it’s easier to choose too, at least at the extremes: if you want a budget priced gravel bike, choose the alloy Grizl; if you want a lightweight performance gravel race bike and have the budget to pay for it, choose the Grail CFR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the mid-range, the Grail and Grizl are pitched at similar price points and use similar components, so if you’re in the market for a carbon gravel bike, the choice between Grizl and Grail is going to come down to the sort of riding you want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re excited by more extreme styles of off-road riding or want to carry a lot of kit into the wilderness, then pick the Grizl. It’s a great gravel bike and is still far from mediocre on less technical terrain or tarmac. Its wider tyre clearance and the suspension fork and dropper seatpost options may help you get further into the unknown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you prize speed on smoother surfaces or fancy trying a bit of gravel racing, you might benefit from the aerodynamics and lower weight and rolling resistance offered by the Grail. With narrower tyres, it’s also a great fast gravel bike that could be used for light touring, even if it does miss out on rack mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happily, even within the Grail and Grizl lines there’s plenty of variety. For example, both ranges provide the option to pick between single or double chainring groupsets, so there’s no need to compromise on the spec to meet your gravel aims.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy a Canyon Grail now from <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/performance/grail-generation-2/?srule=sort_price_ascending&amp;start=0&amp;sz=9\" target=\"_blank\">canyon.com</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy a Canyon Grizl now from <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/adventure/grizl/\" target=\"_blank\">canyon.com</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Struggling to choose your next gravel bike?
