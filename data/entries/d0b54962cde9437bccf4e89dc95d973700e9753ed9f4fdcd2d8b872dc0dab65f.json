Mimicking traditional video game controls, the Zwift Play hardware is designed to make Zwift’s in-game toolbar easier to access while on the bike, in the hope this will boost rider interaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Play hardware comprises two controllers that attach via silicone straps around the handlebars, with the display panels sitting on the inside of the shift levers. Zwift says these controllers are only intended for drop-bar bikes but that it will be monitoring demand for a flat-bar alternative in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-5-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Play controllers also allow access to braking and steering within the game. Previously steering add-ons such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/elite-sterzo-smart-steering-riser-block-review\" target=\"_blank\">Elite Sterzo</a> have been available from other manufacturers, though these worked by detecting physical movement of the the whole front end of the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the hardware launch, Zwift has released the Beta Zwift Play Game Experience. The platform update aims to offer a more gamified version of the existing software, where users will be able to try out courses and features specifically designed around the new steering and braking functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Play controllers come as a pair and are available at an initial price of £99 / €99 / $99, with a forecasted MSRP of £149 in the future.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/turbo-training-accessories-everything-you-need-for-training-indoors\">Turbo training accessories: Everything you need for training indoors</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/buyers-guide-best-exercise-bikes\">Best exercise bikes 2023: Keep fit this winter</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\">Best cycling indoor training apps to make you a better cyclist in 2023</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Increasing interaction</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift says the ‘action’ toolbar sits at the heart of its software and that users who regularly use it, as well as the Companion app, are 2-3 times more active on the platform than those that don’t. Zwift says it found that this kind of engagement was hindered by the reality of most riders’ setups, with keyboards and phones not always easily to hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Play controllers serve a primary function of increasing toolbar usability while on the bike, as riders can access all of the different functions without taking their hands off the handlebars. These features include sending ‘Ride On’ encouragement to other users, initiating ‘Power Ups’ and teleporting to pacer groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders should also be able to skip workout blocks during planned training sessions as well as adjusting their FTP bias based on how they’re feeling that day, without having to sit down at their laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until now, riders were typically limited in their ability to position accurately in a bunch or on a route, relying on altering their power input to affect their place on the road. Zwift says the new braking and steering features are designed to solve this problem and give a more realistic cycling experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The controllers feature lower paddles that are pushed inwards for braking and toggled outwards to steer in the direction of that shifter. Zwift says it tested the Play controllers on 400 real world bikes, working in conjunction with a bike repair shop, with a claimed 97.6% compatibility. The silicone straps hook around the drops, attaching in a similar fashion to regular bike lights. Spacers are included with the controllers which aim to allow a snug fit even on narrower bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift says it has done 300 reliability tests regarding water ingress and claims that there are ‘no routes in’ for water or sweat – an understandable concern when mixing indoor training and on-bike electronics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>To the future</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Zwift_play-1.jpg 1620w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beta Zwift Play Experience appears to be the tip of the iceberg in what Zwift is hoping to achieve over the coming years with its software. The new gaming beta – a revamped version of the existing ‘Repack Ridge’ route – aims to make indoor training more enjoyable and thereby increase engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the games seem pretty tame for now – navigating winding courses with the steering, looking for in-game boosts and so on – the controllers do open up a host of opportunities for the future, depending on where Zwift intends to focus. For example, the steering ability makes the option of a velodrome circuit possible, as well as allowing integration of wind and enhanced drafting elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift says it hopes it can use the games to improve the ‘fun’ side of fitness as well, incorporating sprints and efforts into the gaming experience so that riders are doing training such as intervals without even noticing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Play controllers can be charged at the same time and, most notably, while in use, with a claimed 20 hours ride time from one charge. The controllers feature LED buttons to display pairing and charging statuses and require an individual Bluetooth connection for each side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The controllers are available now for £99 / €99 / $99, but that’s expected to rise to £149 in the future.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zwift-play-controllers\">Less pain cave, more game cave: Zwift Play controllers bring steering, braking and gaming to indoor cycling</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Charlotte Head &#124; Tech Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d0b54962cde9437bccf4e89dc95d973700e9753ed9f4fdcd2d8b872dc0dab65f","category":"Cycling"}
