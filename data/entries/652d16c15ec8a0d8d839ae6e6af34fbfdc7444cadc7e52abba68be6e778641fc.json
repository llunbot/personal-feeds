{"title":"Ten Years of Six Colors","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/09/ten/","date":1726524144000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ten years sure seems like a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years ago the iPhone got physically big for the first time.\n(In the ensuing decade, iPhone revenue has doubled.) Ten years ago\nApple announced the Apple Watch.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years ago I found myself without a job for the first time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I ran into Snell before (and again after) Apple’s event last week, and he mentioned that it marked Six Colors’s 10th anniversary. My reaction: I somehow simultaneously think of Six Colors as still kinda new <em>and</em> a bedrock of the Apple media firmament.</p>\n\n<p>On days like today, it’s the first site I visit, because of pieces like these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dan Moren: “<a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/09/ios-18-review/\">iOS 18 Review: Your iPhone, Your Way</a>”</li>\n<li>Snell: “<a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/09/ipados-18-review-ish-math-notes-calculator-and-weird-tab-bars/\">iPadOS 18 Review (ish): Math Notes, Calculator, and Weird Tab Bars</a>”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And, nearest and dearest to my heart, <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/09/macos-sequoia-review/\">Snell’s review of MacOS 15 Sequoia</a>. All of that, just today.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/16/ten-years-of-six-colors\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"652d16c15ec8a0d8d839ae6e6af34fbfdc7444cadc7e52abba68be6e778641fc","category":"Tech"}
