{"title":"MLS Season Pass Drops Price for Midseason","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/01/mls-season-pass-price-drop-for-midseason/","date":1685662490000,"content":"\n<p>Benjamin Mayo, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/channel/mls-season-pass/tvs.sbd.7000\">MLS Season Pass on Apple TV</a> is dropping its price to account for\nthe fact that about half of the season is now over. The 2023 pass\nsubscription is now available for $49 (down from $99), with an\nadditional $10 discount for Apple TV+ subscribers. The monthly\nsubscription price is unchanged.</p>\n\n<p>Although Apple does not release viewership figures, Apple SVP of\nservices Eddy Cue commented this week that MLS Season Pass had\nexceeded its own expectations and doing “much better than\nforecasted” in terms of both subscription and viewership numbers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We’ll have to take Cue at his word on that, given that Apple never released its forecast nor is releasing viewership numbers now, but I’m not surprised. MLS has a smaller fanbase than the NFL, NBA, MLB, or even NHL, but I’m sure its fans skew younger.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/01/mls-season-pass-cue\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"84219b66199fce8f654296b0bfec478c0804e7704cb7d4d79369d62841ae0fad","category":"Tech"}
