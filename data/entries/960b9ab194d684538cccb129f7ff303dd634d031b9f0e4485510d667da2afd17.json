Despite the added kickstand flap, the battery is thinner than Anker's previous PowerCore Magnetic 5K power bank and only marginally thicker than Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>. I've been using the 622 for a few days, and while my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> Max gets great battery life on its own, Anker's battery pack is handy to have around for some extra juice (it charges the phone at up to 7.5W) or to prop up my phone. It's priced at $59.99 and is available in five colors: Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, Lilac Purple, and Buds Green.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/anker-622-battery.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><b><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa2568\">Anker 623 Magnetic Wireless Charger</a></b>: A can-shaped dual wireless charger with a hinged MagSafe-compatible surface to hold your ‌iPhone‌ in a range of orientations. The weighted base keeps your phone steady even in a semi-vertical orientation at up to 7.5W, and with the magnetic base deployed, it reveals a standard 5W wireless charging surface where you can charge AirPods or another phone. I've also been using this one for a few days, and it's a great addition to my desktop setup. It's priced at $79.99 and available in Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, and Lilac Purple.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/anker-623-charger.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><b><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25a7\">Anker 633 Magnetic Wireless Charger</a></b>: A 2-in-1 desktop charging stand with a MagSafe-compatible charging surface that's actually a removable 5,000 mAh portable power bank that charges at up to 7.5W.

There are three power outlets, two USB-C ports that can support up to 65W PD fast charging, and two USB-A ports.

It features both USB-C and USB-A ports on the rear for compatibility with most car models, and it has an always-on glow surface on the charging pad to help you find it in a dark car.
