Bookcase adds handles to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or another smartphone to make the device more comfortable to hold when reading.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/bookcase.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" />\r<br />\nWith Bookcase, Astropad is aiming to turn the ‌iPhone‌ into an e-reader. The accessory provides a more ergonomic grip for long reading sessions, and holding the ‌iPhone‌ doesn't block part of the display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Bookcase is adjustable so it is able to work with almost all modern ‌iPhone‌ and Android smartphones, plus it comes with a companion app to create Shortcuts to launch reading apps automatically. With the Shortcut, a reading app can be set to open up whenever the ‌iPhone‌ is put into Bookcase thanks to an included NFC tag.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the ‌iPhone‌ 12 and later, the ‌iPhone‌ secures to the Bookcase using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>. For older iPhones, there's an included ‌MagSafe‌ conversion kit. Bookcase can be used with MagSafe-compatible ‌iPhone‌ cases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Astropad, Bookcase is ideal for commutes, lunch breaks, bedtime, and more, and it replaces the need to purchase an e-reader when the ‌iPhone‌ already offers the same general functionality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBookcase can be <a href=\"https://shop.astropad.com/products/bookcase\">purchased from the Astropad website</a> for $40.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/astropad-bookcase/\">Astropad Launches 'Bookcase' for Turning an iPhone Into an E-Reader</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/astropad-launches-bookcase-for-turning-an-iphone-into-an-e-reader.2440816/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2da69e3eb35687cb439acd6fd809d184a841bf38dede2cec5474d68b143c15d8","category":"Apple"}
