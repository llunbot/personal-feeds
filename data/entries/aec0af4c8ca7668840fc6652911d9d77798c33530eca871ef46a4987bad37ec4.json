Copilot is a personal finance tool whose only goal is to give you a bird’s-eye view of your finances, without compromising your privacy. I started using it when they booked this sponsorship, and I love it. It’s really easy to add your accounts — banks, credit cards, investments — and the UI is clear, useful, and attractive. Whether you’re interested in tracking your net worth, monthly spending, or investment returns, Copilot can do it all. </p>\n\n<p>Use the code <strong>DARING</strong> when starting an in-app subscription to double Copilot’s usual one-month free trial, and see for yourself why they have a 4.8 rating in the App Store. <a href=\"https://www.copilot.money/?utm_source=sponsorship&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball\">Learn more and get started</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/10/copilot\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"aec0af4c8ca7668840fc6652911d9d77798c33530eca871ef46a4987bad37ec4","category":"Tech"}
