Of those, the parents who responded that they demonstrated proper handling to their child or teen, had their kid practice safe handling under supervision, and/or taught their kid how to shoot a firearm were more likely than other gun-owning parents to keep at least one gun unsecured—that is, unlocked and loaded. In fact, each of the three responses carried at least double the odds of the parent having an unlocked, loaded gun around, the study found.</p>\n<p>The survey responses may seem like a paradox for parents who value safe and responsible gun handling. Previous studies have suggested that safe storage of firearms can <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2733158\">reduce the risk of injuries and deaths among children and teens</a>. A 2005 JAMA study, for instance, found <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200330\">lower risks of firearm injuries among children and teens</a> when parents securely store their firearms—meaning they kept them locked, unloaded, and stored separately from locked ammunition. And as of 2020, <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2201761\">firearm-related injuries became the leading cause of death among children and teens</a> in the US.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048347#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048347&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5a105d7575daa003ceecfb45c66176f1d37e5d2b2b638897ad6d5ca48f15533","category":"Tech"}
