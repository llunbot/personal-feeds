But Warner Bros. doesn't want us to completely forget about <em>Dune</em> in the meantime, so it dropped another trailer for the holiday season.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Dune: Part One</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/latest-dune-trailer-gives-us-our-best-look-yet-at-denis-villeneuves-epic-film/\">reported previously</a> (also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/needs-more-zendaya-we-have-our-first-look-at-the-new-dune-film/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/destiny-awaits-timothee-chalamet-is-the-chosen-one-in-first-dune-trailer/\">here</a>), Herbert's novel <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/aquaman-khal-drogo-actor-may-play-duncan-idaho-in-new-dune-film/\"><em>Dune</em> is set in the distant future</a> and follows the fortunes of various noble houses in what amounts to a feudal interstellar society. Much of the action takes place on the planet Arrakis, where the economy is driven largely by a rare, life-extending drug called melange (\"the spice\"). Melange also conveys a kind of prescience and makes faster-than-light travel practical. There's betrayal, a prophecy concerning a messianic figure, giant sandworms, and battle upon battle as protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) contends with rival House Harkonnen and strives to defeat the forces of Shaddam IV, Emperor of the Known Universe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990472#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990472&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94fd8ae405c1dc132691b7cc7235345297584e44583765ccf08ca00794d0b28b","category":"Tech"}
