Apple's current design assumes that testers are familiar with an app that they're invited to test, while the refresh provides key information to testers who might not be in tune with what an app is designed to do.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with design changes, the new version of the app lets developers enroll testers that meet multiple criteria, such as specific devices and operating system versions. TestFlight will only allow testers that meet the criteria to accept a public TestFlight invitation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not yet released the redesigned TestFlight app, but it will likely come at some point this summer or in the fall when ‌iOS 18‌ goes live.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther changes planned for ‌App Store‌ Connect include a Nominations option for developers to inform the ‌App Store‌ Editorial Team about new content for consideration for an ‌App Store‌ feature, and alerts when an app gets an ‌App Store‌ feature that include marketing assets for social media.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/\">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-connect/\">App Store Connect</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/apple-redesigning-testflight-app-in-ios-18/\">Apple Redesigning TestFlight App in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-redesigning-testflight-app-in-ios-18.2429234/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"366872cb788f4f033c34708c7b7f6761d01f014b58e676a4da2f67687fa32e71","category":"Apple"}
