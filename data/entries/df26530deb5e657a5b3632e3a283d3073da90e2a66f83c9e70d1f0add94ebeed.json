One of its new features is its boosted external display support. On the 10-core M4 iMac models, the external display support is impressive on paper. Here’s what the $1,499, $1,699, and $1,899 iMacs can do with external displays over Thunderbolt:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run up to two external displays, with each display at 6K/60Hz, or</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run one external display at 8K/120Hz</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/imac-display-support.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"M4 iMac display support\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/imac-display-support.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/imac-display-support.jpg?resize=300%2C123&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/imac-display-support.jpg?resize=768%2C316&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/imac-display-support.jpg?resize=1200%2C493&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/imac-display-support.jpg?resize=1536%2C631&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/imac-display-support.jpg?resize=2048%2C841&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"493\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The new M4 iMac boasts support for some pretty hefty displays.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a nice upgrade from the previous single external display support (up to 6K/60Hz) on the M1 and M3 iMac and Apple’s other Macs. The funny thing is, while you can find third-party 8K displays, Apple doesn’t currently offer one. The current <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Apple Studio Display</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667913/apple-pro-display-xdr-review-hands-on.html\">Pro Display XDR</a> have resolutions of 5K display and 6K respectively, and both displays have refresh rates of 60Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, could this 8K/120Hz support by the M4 iMac be a sign that Apple is planning to release a new display? Considering that the Pro Display XDR will be six years old in December, it’s due for an update–60Hz for a professional display is ludicrous, not to mention that the Pro Display XDR does not have a camera. The Apple Studio Display was released two years ago and is probably not going to be updated; it would remain the “affordable” alternative to a new Pro Display XDR (if they call it that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is rumored to be launching a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">new redesigned Mac mini</a> this week, which is offered as a base M-series model and a model with an M-series Pro chip. If the M4 can run one 8K/120Hz display, you can bet the M4 Pro can too and probably more. So the new M4 Pro Mac mini release seems like a good time to release a new 8K Pro Display XDR with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. Will it happen? We’ll find out sometime in the next two days.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"df26530deb5e657a5b3632e3a283d3073da90e2a66f83c9e70d1f0add94ebeed","category":"Apple"}
