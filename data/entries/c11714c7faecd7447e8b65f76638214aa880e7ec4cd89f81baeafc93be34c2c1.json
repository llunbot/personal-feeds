Amazon has slashed the price of every AirPods model to record lows. So whether you need a pair for yourself or someone you love this Valentine’s Day, you’re going to get an incredible deal:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods Pro (2nd-gen with USB-C)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $190</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $59</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why we love them:</strong> Apple updated the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro with a USB-C case in September and they’re already cheaper than they’ve ever been. Otherwise, Apple didn’t change anything else: the design and the features are the same as the Lightning model: 2X better noise cancellation than the 1st-gen model, as well as longer battery life and better audio, along with a slew of other features. And if you have a Vision Pro, you’ll get lossless audio too.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0CHWRXH8B/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<h3>AirPods (3rd-gen with Lightning case)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $140</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $29</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why we love them:</strong> Apple’s 3rd-gen AirPods are more than two years old, but they’re still one of the best earbuds you can buy, with personalized spatial audio, sweat and water resistance, adaptive EQ, and longer battery life. (Just note: This sale is for the wired case which needs to be plugged into a Lightning cable to charge, but we think wireless charging for AirPods is a bit overrated anyway.)</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<h3>AirPods (2nd-gen)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $89</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $39</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why we love them:</strong> Apple’s older AirPods are missing all of the new features found in the 3rd-gen model, but they’re still great earbuds when you can save nearly $40 on them. They have an older design and are missing spatial audio and noise cancellation, but they’re a fantastic set of earbuds for the price.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c11714c7faecd7447e8b65f76638214aa880e7ec4cd89f81baeafc93be34c2c1","category":"Apple"}
