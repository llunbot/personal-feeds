Some popular Android smartphones have rear cameras positioned towards the top center, such as Google's Pixel 8 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report said the new iPhone 17 model will feature a \"major redesign\" akin to the iPhone X, so it sounds like Apple has big plans for this device. With the report claiming the device could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which starts at $1,199, perhaps it will end up being the \"iPhone Ultra\" that has been rumored for a few years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is everything that the report mentioned about the slimmer iPhone 17:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>Between a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">likely 6.5-inch</a>)</li>\r<br />\n<li>A \"significantly thinner\" design with an aluminum frame</li>\r<br />\n<li>Rear cameras moved to \"top center\" of device</li>\r<br />\n<li>A higher price tag than the Pro Max model in the iPhone lineup</li>\r<br />\n<li>Improved front camera</li>\r<br />\n<li>A narrower Dynamic Island</li>\r<br />\n<li>A19 chip</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRead our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/\">initial coverage of the report</a> for more details about the device.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slim-iphone-17-top-center-cameras-rumor/\">'iPhone 17 Slim' Could Move Rear Cameras to Top Center in Biggest Redesign Since iPhone X</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-slim-could-move-rear-cameras-to-top-center-in-biggest-redesign-since-iphone-x.2426715/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b85522ce0bc3edd70c25dd10e33556d3c1104a1d2baac85dda661f14d4a5172c","category":"Apple"}
