Most riders capable of winning bunch sprints wouldn’t get over it, and Pedersen admitted that “I was in doubt when you looked at the stage before – I thought I would be on the limit”. But like every other obstacle this year, he did manage to overcome it, and then he still had the reserves, speed and power to finish the job off in Vlorë. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Except on the hard mountain stages, there are very, very few bike riders who are able to better Pedersen right now. Is he in the shape of his life? “You guys [the press] say this every time a rider performs well in a long period that they’re in the shape of their life,” the Dane, 29, said, preferring to be modest. “I’m in really good shape, and we managed to carry it on from the Classics to now, so I can’t complain.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>“What I want to say also is that we have to take into account that these stages fit me really well – they’re suited for me and are easier to show what I’m good at. If we had started with one flat sprint and I finished fifth, maybe we wouldn’t have talked about my shape, and it would have looked completely different, but these three days in Albania have suited me really well.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Deflecting attention is how you’d summarise that answer. But the reality is, Pedersen keeps riding back into the spotlight: the last time he finished outside of the top-10 in a race that he had ambitions of winning was last September’s World Championships, when he rolled in to the finish in 13th place. Everything is clicking into place for the former world champion.</span><b></b></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-4763_1024x1024.jpg?v=1746988868\" alt=\"Mads Pedersen wins Giro d'Italia 2025 stage three\" /></div>\n<p><span>“One thing is that we have our</span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/my-ongoing-three-year-battle-with-cancer-by-lidl-trek-manager-luca-guercilena\"><span> team manager</span></a><span> back with us full-time after we didn’t see him for years due to sickness,” Pedersen said, referencing </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/my-ongoing-three-year-battle-with-cancer-by-lidl-trek-manager-luca-guercilena\"><span>Luca Guercilena</span></a><span>’s recovery from cancer. “We have one guy back in control, dealing with pressure, and how he deals with everyone and the staff makes a difference. We also have more people in the team, more training camps, and every small detail is looked into: bikes, aerodynamics, clothing; everything is suited more to each rider. Maybe before a coach had 10 riders, but now they have six or seven riders, and it gives everyone less stress and more commitment to each rider. It makes a big difference.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Ever the thankful leader, Pedersen paid tribute to Giulio Ciccone after his stage one work, and this time he singled out Mathias Vacek, the race’s current leader of its youth classification. “Vacek is absolutely amazing – this kid has a big future,” Pedersen predicted. “He showed it again today what he’s able to do and we have to watch out that we don’t put a lock on this guy. He can win a lot of bike races, I tell you, and I will do everything I can to make it possible for him to win a stage. He was there for me throughout all of the Classics and he is a machine. I’m so proud that this guy is able to ride for me.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>The narrative around Pedersen during the Spring Classics was how unfortunate he was to be competing in the era of Pogačar and Van der Poel, for without those two, he would surely have several Monuments to his name. Now’s not the time to bring that back up, though, instead, it’s time to saviour a bike rider operating at the peak of his powers. Just don’t ask him whether he thinks it or not. </span></p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"e1c1f22785bd40a3af343aaeb33487ecd42c8bf822cd617065eac27cfec053f3","category":"Cycling"}
