{"title":"Google Announces Plan for Compliance With South Korean ‘App Stores Must Offer Alternative In-App Payments’ Law, and It’s Something","link":"https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html","date":1636140323000,"content":"\n<p>Wilson White, senior director of public policy, on Google’s Korean developer blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Service fees for distributing apps via Android and Google Play\nwill continue to be based on digital sales on the platform. We\nrecognize, however, that developers will incur costs to support\ntheir billing system, so when a user selects alternative billing,\nwe will reduce the developer’s service fee by 4%. For example,\nfor the vast majority of developers who pay 15% for transactions\nthrough Google Play’s billing system, their service fee for\ntransactions through the alternate billing system would be 11%.\nAs another example, certain categories of apps participating in\nour <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/about/mediaprogram/\">Media Experience Program</a>, such as an eBooks provider,\nwill pay a 10% service fee for transactions made via Google\nPlay’s billing system, but only 6% for transactions on an\nalternative system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you just start reading from the beginning, it sounds like they are proposing what many of us thought Google (and Apple) might have to offer to comply with South Korea’s new law: the option for third-party apps to completely circumvent paying Google a fee on in-app transactions. But what they’re actually proposing is that if third party apps want to offer their own credit card processing, they can, but (a) only alongside Google Play, and (b) they still owe Google for most of the fees.</p>\n\n<p>As Ben Thompson observed on today’s episode of <a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">Dithering</a>, for <em>small</em> transactions — like the ones typically offered in games — credit card fees are likely in the 5-6 percent range. So if this flies, Google’s revenue per in-app transaction for apps from the Play Store isn’t going to effectively change at all.</p>\n\n<p>Is it going to fly? Like I’ve said, stock up on popcorn.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/05/google-south-korea\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b7935bf9a668f5247bcff405189ab3085ba4fbeda3f68325e1d0d568d5fdffda","category":"Tech"}
