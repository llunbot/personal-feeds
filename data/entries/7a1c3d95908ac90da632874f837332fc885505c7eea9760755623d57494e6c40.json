Apple did not provide a timeframe for global expansion of the system, if such a move ever happens.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also addressed the hypothetical possibility of a particular region in the world deciding to corrupt a safety organization in an attempt to abuse the system, noting that the system's first layer of protection is an undisclosed threshold before a user is flagged for having inappropriate imagery. Even if the threshold is exceeded, Apple said its manual review process would serve as an additional barrier and confirm the absence of known CSAM imagery. Apple said it would ultimately not report the flagged user to NCMEC or law enforcement agencies and that the system would still be working exactly as designed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also highlighted some proponents of the system, with some parties praising the company for its efforts to fight child abuse.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"We support the continued evolution of Apple's approach to child online safety,\" said Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute. \"Given the challenges parents face in protecting their kids online, it is imperative that tech companies continuously iterate and improve their safety tools to respond to new risks and actual harms.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple did admit that there is no silver bullet answer as it relates to the potential of the system being abused, but the company said it is committed to using the system solely for known CSAM imagery detection.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/apple-to-consider-csam-detection-per-country/\">Apple Addresses CSAM Detection Concerns, Will Consider Expanding System on Per-Country Basis</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-addresses-csam-detection-concerns-will-consider-expanding-system-on-per-country-basis.2306746/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LrV-C-0dZHA:k3mVUWmejwc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LrV-C-0dZHA:k3mVUWmejwc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LrV-C-0dZHA\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7a1c3d95908ac90da632874f837332fc885505c7eea9760755623d57494e6c40","category":"Apple"}
