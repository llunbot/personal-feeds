Then on Monday, Apple dropped a surprising update to the tiny speaker—but unfortunately, nothing has really changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning Wednesday, the HomePod mini will be offered in a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini\" target=\"_blank\">new Midnight color</a>, replacing the previous Space Gray colorway. That leaves the AirPods Max and iPad Air as the only remaining Apple products that come in Space Gray. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple previously offered the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1509062/homepod-2023-review.html\">2nd-gen HomePod</a> in Midnight when it arrived last February, so it’s somewhat surprising it took this long to come to the mini. However, the two colors are extremely similar, with Midnight having a very slight dark blue tint in certain lighting. Otherwise, the new HomePod mini is identical to the previous model, with the same $99 price tag and specs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple appears to be on a mission to replace all of its Space Gray products. Last year, Apple retired the Space Gray MacBook Pro in favor of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2124958/16-inch-macbook-pro-m3-max-review.html\">Space Black</a> and the MacBook Air’s longtime Space Gray color was replaced with Midnight when the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">M2 model</a> arrived in 2022.</p>\n\nHomePod</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2dd50a95a163a7657182ef22631c98dfa9823d6df6e212a1bc6955fc3fd58b28","category":"Apple"}
