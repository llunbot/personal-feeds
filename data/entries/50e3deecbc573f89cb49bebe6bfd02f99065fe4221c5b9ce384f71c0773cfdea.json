The GCN+ service and GCN App will cease to exist after December 19th. The news comes just as worldwide cyclocross and track racing coverage is at an all-time high. Don’t worry; you still have time to plan your cyclocross worlds and classics coverage, though it might be a pricer option.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GCN-Closing-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"469\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GCN-Closing--e1700058625812.png\" alt=\"GCN+ Closing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GCN-Closing--e1700058625812.png 469w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GCN-Closing--e1700058625812-297x134.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GCN-Closing--e1700058625812-120x54.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is GCN Closing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, GCN is not closing. They are, however, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, the new broadcast partners of the UCI Mountain Bike World Series. The content will keep flowing but will be available on the globalcyclingnetwork.com website and the GCN YouTube channels, rather than the GCN App.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cannondale-SuperSlice-Evo-TT-bike-sneak-peek_prototype-disc-brake-carbon-time-trial-bike-raced-at-Tirreno-Adriatico-by-EF-Pro-Cycling-Rigoberto-Uran_screengrabs-from-GCNplus.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cannondale-SuperSlice-Evo-TT-bike-sneak-peek_prototype-disc-brake-carbon-time-trial-bike-raced-at-Tirreno-Adriatico-by-EF-Pro-Cycling-Rigoberto-Uran_screengrabs-from-GCNplus-800x384.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSlice Evo TT bike sneak peek, prototype disc brake carbon time trial bike, GCN+ race coverage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cannondale-SuperSlice-Evo-TT-bike-sneak-peek_prototype-disc-brake-carbon-time-trial-bike-raced-at-Tirreno-Adriatico-by-EF-Pro-Cycling-Rigoberto-Uran_screengrabs-from-GCNplus-800x384.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cannondale-SuperSlice-Evo-TT-bike-sneak-peek_prototype-disc-brake-carbon-time-trial-bike-raced-at-Tirreno-Adriatico-by-EF-Pro-Cycling-Rigoberto-Uran_screengrabs-from-GCNplus-297x143.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cannondale-SuperSlice-Evo-TT-bike-sneak-peek_prototype-disc-brake-carbon-time-trial-bike-raced-at-Tirreno-Adriatico-by-EF-Pro-Cycling-Rigoberto-Uran_screengrabs-from-GCNplus-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cannondale-SuperSlice-Evo-TT-bike-sneak-peek_prototype-disc-brake-carbon-time-trial-bike-raced-at-Tirreno-Adriatico-by-EF-Pro-Cycling-Rigoberto-Uran_screengrabs-from-GCNplus-768x369.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cannondale-SuperSlice-Evo-TT-bike-sneak-peek_prototype-disc-brake-carbon-time-trial-bike-raced-at-Tirreno-Adriatico-by-EF-Pro-Cycling-Rigoberto-Uran_screengrabs-from-GCNplus.jpg 1500w\" /></a><figcaption>Race coverage from GCN+</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where can I watch my favorite racing? </strong>Warner Bros.
