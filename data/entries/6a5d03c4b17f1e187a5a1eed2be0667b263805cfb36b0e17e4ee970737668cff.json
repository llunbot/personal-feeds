Once you confirm your Facebook Pay details, the cash gift will be instantly deposited into your bank account. To send a birthday cash gift, go to the Facebook mobile app and tap the button that appears alongside your friend's birthday posts in your Facebook News Feed or their profile.</blockquote>Within the app, Messenger users will now be able to conduct polls within group chats, allowing groups to easily vote on specific topics and play \"Most Likely to.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn more celebratory features, Messenger is releasing a new \"Messenger is 10!\" sticker pack to users, offering fun effects such as purple balloons or candles.
