With an ocean of connectivity options and incompatible standards, taming this mess has been challenging, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/matter-1-4-has-some-solid-ideas-for-the-future-home-now-lets-see-the-support/\">Matter</a> could finally have a shot at making things a little less frustrating. The latest version of the standard has launched, offering multiple ways to streamline the usually aggravating setup process.</p>\n<p>The first public release of Matter was in late 2022, but compatible systems didn't get support until the following year. Now, there are Matter-certified devices like smart bulbs and sensors that will talk to Apple, Google, Amazon, and other smart home platforms. <a href=\"https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/a-smarter-start-matter-1-4-1-makes-setup-easier/\">Matter 1.4.1</a> includes support for multi-device QR codes, NFC connection, and integrated terms and conditionsâ€”all of these have the potential to eliminate some very real smart home headaches.</p>\n<p>It's common for retailers to offer multi-packs of devices like light bulbs or smart plugs. That can save you some money, but setting up all those devices is tedious. With Matter 1.4.1, it might be much easier thanks to multi-device QR codes. Manufacturers can now include a QR code in the package that will pair all the included devices with your smart home system when scanned.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/matter-update-may-finally-take-the-tedium-out-of-setting-up-your-smart-home/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/matter-update-may-finally-take-the-tedium-out-of-setting-up-your-smart-home/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"775a9de179bdb8a843afa059fff164dc769b0c7866acd65786c79cb4cb1543c7","category":"Tech"}
