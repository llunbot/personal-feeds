{"title":"Subtle Tweaks to the Harris/Walz Logo","link":"https://www.threads.net/@jonathanhoefler/post/C-oBpJeuoA1","date":1723600023000,"content":"\n<p>Jonathan Hoefler, on Threads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Harris/Walz logo got a smart and subtle haircut this weekend,\nwhich, like the very best typography, is making everything better\nwhile drawing very little attention to itself.</p>\n\n<p>I read a lot of comments about political logos… Having helped\nshape the logo of every Democratic president in the twenty-first\ncentury (<a href=\"https://www.typography.com/blog/tag/Biden\">hflr.io/biden</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typography.com/blog/tag/Obama\">hflr.io/obama</a>), let me say from\nexperience that campaign typography is <em>completely</em> unlike graphic\ndesign: it’s a strange and fascinating agility sport, marked by\nlimited information, a ticking clock, unimaginable pressures, and\nserious consequences. It’s Iron Chef, but in Adobe Illustrator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The “Harris” was fine all along, and only ever-so-slightly tweaked in this updated logo. It was the “Walz” that needed help, and got it here. Making the letters in “Walz” just a tad taller makes the whole mark feel significantly more cohesive.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/13/harris-walz-logo-tweaks\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"773ac248679082a4184188cbd6537652a4cd586e2f37c8d3c792f9456c39e2f8","category":"Tech"}
