Being Linux, there are still some quirks to figure out. One of them involves games trying to make use of Intel's upscaling tools.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/intel-a770-a750-review-strong-gpu-alternatives-that-we-very-nearly-recommend\">Intel's ARC series GPUs are interesting</a>, in many senses of the word. They offer the best implementation of Intel's image reconstruction system, XeSS, similar to Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR. XeSS, like its counterparts, utilizes machine learning to fill in the pixel gaps on anti-aliased objects and scenes. The results are sometimes clear, sometimes a bit fuzzy if you pay close attention. In our review of Intel's A770 and A750 GPUs in late 2022, we noted that cross-compatibility between all three systems could be in the works.</p>\n<p>That kind of easy-swap function is not the case when a game is running on a customized version of the WINE Windows-on-Linux, translating Direct3D graphics calls to Vulkan and prodding to see whether it, too, can make use of Intel's graphics boost. <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Graphics-Hogwarts-Legacy\">As noted by Phoronix</a>, Intel developers contributing to <a href=\"https://mesa3d.org/\">the open source Mesa graphics project</a> added the ability to hide an Intel GPU from the Vulkan Linux driver.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959896#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959896&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"79883c2a31b5acf169befb49195c4ee2339fd5f1fdc602c4ff4562b6a0e3bc2c","category":"Tech"}
