Why should drop bar riders care? Well, XTR Di2 hasn’t been upgraded for ten years and the groupset’s new features, including a fully wireless design, are likely to find their way into future road and gravel groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the electronic 2×12-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-rx825-di2-12-speed-groupset-review\">GRX RX825 Di2</a> gravel bike groupset was launched back in May 2024 and Shimano has had both 1×12-speed and 2×12-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-grx-mechanical-12-speed\">mechanical GRX</a> components available since August 2023, the missing part of the gravel groupset puzzle is still an electronic 1×12-speed option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We reckon that, when launched, a 1×12-speed GRX Di2 groupset will inherit many of the features of XTR Di2, so Shimano’s new flagship MTB groupset shows us much of what to expect from 1x GRX Di2. Some of its new tech is likely to find its way into future generations of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-shimano-groupsets\">Shimano road groupsets</a> as well. Here’s what’s new with XTR Di2.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Fully wireless</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-970x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-970x970.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-300x300.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-150x150.webp 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-768x768.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-2048x2048.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-75x75.webp 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-350x350.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-750x750.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586103-rd-m9260-12-sgs1-8de548-original-1744290609-1140x1140.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Shimano </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The key new feature of XTR Di2 is that it’s now fully wireless, so there’s no longer an in-frame battery to worry about. Instead, the battery for the derailleur is housed within the derailleur body. It looks neat and also protects the battery, which can still be easily removed for charging, according to Shimano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano’s semi-wireless groupsets with their in-frame battery have advantages and eliminate at least some of the cabling needed through the frame with its previous generation fully-wired groupsets. But Shimano has been the outlier, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset-review\">Campagnolo electronic groupsets</a> now fully wireless and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\">SRAM’s</a> having been wireless from the get-go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully wireless shifting makes building a bike very much easier. It also makes for easier charging too, as this can be done off-bike. Although not so significant for gravel bikes, the current generation of performance road bikes is so skinny, in order to make them more aero, that bike makers have had to resort to cunning ways to squeeze Shimano’s Di2 battery into their frames, as it won’t fit in its usual standard placement in the seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized, for example, suspends the battery in the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\"> Tarmac SL8</a> below the seatpost, while Cannondale mounts it inside a hatch in the down tube in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\">SuperSix Evo</a> and Factor pushes it up through the bottom bracket shell in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/factor-ostro-vam-road-bike-review\">Ostro VAM</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A future switch to fully wireless road bike groupsets from Shimano could free up even more innovation in road bike design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question, however, is battery life. Shimano says you can ride for 1,000km with its in-frame battery. It hasn’t given any stats for the capacity of its XTR battery, but we’d guess it’s significantly less. Since it resides in the derailleur, rather than being hooked on its back, as with SRAM and Campagnolo batteries, its size and capacity could be even lower, so it might need to be charged up fairly frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-970x332.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-1-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plus wired option</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano does offer a wired version of the XTR derailleur though, designed to be powered by the main battery in electric mountain bikes. A centrally powered derailleur is likely to be a useful option for riders of electric drop bar bikes too, if it’s available in future groupsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM-equipped versions of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/trek-domane-plus-slr-ebike\">Trek Domane+ SLR </a>electric bike already power the derailleurs from the central battery and it’s tech that’s likely to come to other road and gravel bikes and e-bikes in future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tougher</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-970x485.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-970x485.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-300x150.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-768x384.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-1536x768.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-2048x1025.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-360x180.webp 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-750x375.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/586141-xtr-m9200long-cage-rd10-45t-8b663a-original-1744291227-1140x570.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Shimano </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano claims that the new XTR is made to survive trail impacts. There’s a new version of its Shadow design, called Shadow ES, in which the derailleur is wedge-shaped to reduce the frontal profile to help avoid rock strikes. An automatic impact recovery function returns the derailleur to its previous position if it does get bashed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has also added new tech to stabilise the chain, with a dual spring that it says increases chain tension and leads to better chain retention. Solid pulleys help avoid debris collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The derailleur comes in long cage and mid-cage variants. While the former handles a 10-51t cassette, the mid-cage works with a new cassette which has a 9-45t range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, the drop down to nine teeth is new for Shimano, with only Campagnolo going down to nine teeth with its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\">Ekar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-gt-groupset-review\">Ekar GT</a> gravel groupsets. The closer ratio cassette option could well find its way into GRX, where it would offer similar range to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-xplr-axs-groupset-review\">SRAM Red XPLR AXS</a>, a higher gear ratio than the 10-45t cassette offered with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-rx820-groupset-review\">mechanical GRX 1×12-speed</a> and be well-suited to gravel racing. It would need a Microspline freehub, although that’s already a requirement for 1×12-speed GRX mechanical shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has stuck with 12-speed shifting for XTR, rather than pushing on to 13-speed. SRAM too only offers 12 speeds in its MTB groupsets, whereas its Red XPLR AXS gravel groupset and both Campagnolo’s Ekar options are 13-speed. Shimano has been conservative in adding speeds to its road and gravel groupsets, so we wouldn’t expect to see GRX Di2 leapfrog to 13-speed, maintaining compatibility with the rest of the top spec GRX line-up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning to XTR, Shimano offers two versions of its cranks, one aiming at low weight, the other at greater robustness. Again, it’s a feature we might see migrated to GRX 1×12-speed Di2, to suit gravel racers on the one hand and gravel adventure riders on the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are XTR crank lengths from 160mm, while GRX currently goes no shorter than 170mm. The trend to run <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-crank-length-for-cycling\">shorter cranks</a> continues and, for gravel riders, they help add a little ground clearance, so 10mm lopped off the crank arm length might be welcome for many gravel cyclists.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

with the cranks, Shimano offers multiple brake options: one with low weight, one designed to handle downhills and a third designed to balance the properties of both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has tweaked its Servo Wave progression for smooth, fast brake application. The brakes work with a newly reformulated low viscosity mineral oil that is claimed to work consistently over a wider temperature range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has also updated its XTR brake levers, moving the pivot point closer to the bars, and its XTR shifters providing better ergonomics for both. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GRX Di2 1×12-speed incoming?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So when can we expect to see electronic 1×12-speed GRX? We’d guess it will follow fairly soon on the back of XTR, on the assumption that it will offer much of the same tech in a gravel-branded package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d guess too that full wireless shifting will come to the road in the next generation of Shimano electronic groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-xtr-di2-wireless\">Shimano XTR Di2 goes full wireless – is it the blueprint for GRX Di2 1×12-speed?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"44b82d119828e75fb6015401fc594f58a1c4c31923ec7b95e652da8f70fd865a","category":"Cycling"}
