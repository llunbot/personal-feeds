Apple is apparently \"still evaluating component specifications and performance, with strict requirements for crease and reliability.\" Screen creasing is an issue that plagues many current foldable devices, raising concerns about long-term durability and the risk of screen damage from debris. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite the emergence of a range of popular foldable devices from the likes of Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, and Nubia, Apple's delayed entry to the foldable space is not necessarily a disadvantage. The company's significant market influence and established customer base mean that a foldable ‌iPhone‌ could quickly gain popularity upon release. As a result, analysts believe that Apple's entry into the foldable phone space could \"significantly shift market dynamics.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/first-apple-foldable-coming-in-2025/\">widely expected</a> to release a large-screen foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or MacBook to kick-off its foray into the product category before launching a higher volume foldable ‌iPhone‌.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/foldable-iphone-unlikely-to-launch-before-2027/\">Foldable iPhone Unlikely to Launch Before 2027</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-unlikely-to-launch-before-2027.2428044/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f8b3cb03967d9e5454e9dfdcef58444609745f0c90711951c05ab7c2d45dc4be","category":"Apple"}
