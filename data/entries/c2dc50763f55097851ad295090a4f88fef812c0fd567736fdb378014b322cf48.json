Two-time winner Jonas Vingegaard will have ambitions of derailing this quest after a runners-up spot last year. Likewise, last year‚Äôs third-place finisher Remco Evenepoel will be hoping to improve on his bronze medal, especially with a favourable opening week filled with punchy profiles and a time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three will lock horns at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-preview\">the upcoming Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©</a>, but in this day and age, racing isn‚Äôt the only way to build up your Tour de France form. The vast majority of WorldTour pros spend the pre-Tour period at<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/altitude-training-for-cyclists\"> altitude camps</a> across Spain, France or Italy, reaping the physiological benefits from living and training 2,000m above sea level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we are just a month away from the start of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">2025 Tour de France</a> on Saturday 5th July, it‚Äôs an apt time to dive into each of the favourites‚Äô pre-race strategy. After trawling through Strava, Instagram stories and press interviews, we‚Äôve managed to map out their altitude camps, racing schedule ‚Äì whether that be the Dauphin√© or the Tour de Suisse ‚Äì and other pre-Tour commitments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20250427LBL0138-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The reigning Tour de France champion has had one of the most packed schedules among the Tour favourites. In the spring, he was busy sweeping up Monument titles and even dared to enter Paris-Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, Pogaƒçar has been on several altitude camps. In May, he was spotted out in Sierra Nevada alongside some of his Tour domestiques, including Marc Soler, Jo√£o Almeida, Pavel Sivakov and Tim Wellens. He spent several weeks there, fine-tuning his form, and even managed to bump into Jonas Vingegaard, who was also in Spain. This week though, he‚Äôs ventured out to Normandy to recon the route for Stage 5‚Äôs time-trial, which could prove critical in the fight for the yellow jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After his break from racing, the Slovenian will take part in the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, which seems to have monopolised most of the Tour favourites this year. This will be his first time at the race since 2020, but it is still one of the few top-tier stage races he is yet to win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This won‚Äôt be the end of his stringent Tour prep, however. UAE Team Emirates XRG sports director Andrej Hauptman has confirmed that Pogaƒçar still has one altitude camp to complete before heading to the Tour. The location of this camp is unknown, but he spent his final weeks before the 2024 Tour in Isola, close to the French-Italian border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tadej Pogaƒçar‚Äôs pre-tour schedule</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Altitude camp (Location TBC)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-25.webp 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard started his 2025 calendar in winning ways at the Volta ao Algarve. A month later though, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2025-paris-nice-tirreno-adriatico\">he suffered a wrist injury and concussion</a> at Paris-Nice, which forced him out of the race. Instead of heading to the Volta a Catalunya as previously scheduled, he reshuffled his run-up to the Tour to focus on altitude camps instead of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dane, who won the 2022 and 2023 Tour de France, began his official pre-Tour training in Denmark. There, he did wind tunnel testing at an aerodynamic lab in Aalborg in an attempt to improve his time-trial position. After that, he was whisked off to Spain and to his first altitude camp, where he met up with the likes of Victor Campenaerts. Since his almost month-long stint in Spain, he‚Äôs been spotted in Annecy on a training ride the week prior to the Dauphin√©, perhaps in an attempt to scout out some of the climbs that will be included in the final week of this year‚Äôs Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After competing in the Dauphin√©, Vingegaard will return to altitude. This time, he‚Äôll be in Tignes, where Visma-Lease a Bike have been setting up their Tour camp for several years now. As preparations ramp up, his squad for the 2025 Tour seems to have been leaked, given that the Tignes hotel bookings were accidentally revealed by Visma-Lease a Bike staff. With that, we know that Wout van Aert, Matteo Jorgenson, Simon Yates, Edoardo Affini, Victor Campenaerts and Sepp Kuss all have bookings in place for the camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jonas

later start to his 2025 season after getting slammed by a postman‚Äôs car door during the off-season. After refining form at a training camp in Sierra Nevada, he returned in time for the Classics. Since then, the Belgian has been totting up a decent amount of racing days in one-day competitions and stage races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After his spring block, he returned to altitude in Spain to continue his preparations. He was initially under the weather at the camp, but refound his form during the multi-week stay in May. There, he was spotted on rides around the mountains and nearby Malaga alongside Louis Vervaeke, Ilan Van Wilder, Tim Merlier and Maximilian Schachmann ‚Äì all of whom we expect to be on the Tour roster. After arriving back home to Belgium at the beginning of this week, Evenepoel has continued to train on home roads, even posting a photo of <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/pros/23069503?num_entries=10\" target=\"_blank\">his golden Specialized Tarmac in front of the Atomium</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like last year, Remco Evenepoel will compete in the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©. In 2024, he won the time-trial and went into the yellow jersey briefly before finishing in seventh place overall. The Belgian is said to be nearing ‚Äòhis Tour de France weight‚Äô, approximately 1.5kg lighter than he was 12 months ago.

In typical form, the Slovenian crashed out after a week‚Äôs racing through France, just as he has during his three previous Tour attempts. This year, a similar fate has blighted his Tour preparations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rogliƒç crashed out of last month‚Äôs Giro d‚ÄôItalia after suffering several spills over the first two weeks. He was unable to complete the race and, as a result, his Tour de France run-up requires a rethink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we do know is that the Red Bull leader won‚Äôt race before the Tour starts in Lille next month. This includes the Tour de Suisse, which some thought was as a great opportunity to build form and confidence one of the few stage races he‚Äôs yet to win. To continue the mystery, we don‚Äôt know whether he will head to altitude ahead of the Tour. Last year, he went to Tignes, but at this point it is unknown whether he‚Äôll be fit enough to complete this part of his Tour preparations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Primoz Roglic‚Äôs pre-Tour schedule</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Recover from the Giro d‚ÄôItalia</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Carlos Rodr√≠guez (Ineos Grenadiers)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/20240609CDD0152-A.S.O.-Billy-Ceusters-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe considered to be an echelon below the aforementioned stars, Carlos Rodr√≠guez will be leading Ineos Grenadiers, a team that won seven Tour de France titles during the 2010s. Nevertheless, the 24-year-old Spaniard will be joined on the start line in Lille by Geraint Thomas, who will be riding his last Tour as a professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Rodr√≠guez doesn‚Äôt use Strava, we know he was at a training camp in Spain with Tobias Foss and Magnus Sheffield among others. Now that he‚Äôs concluded that camp, he‚Äôll be tuning up his legs at the Dauphin√©. He‚Äôs often gone well here in the past, having won a stage last year. Veteran Thomas will, instead, be going to the Tour de Suisse in an attempt to win one final stage race before retiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another altitude camp is expected before the Tour de France, although details of this remain thin on the ground. Last year, Rodr√≠guez trained away from the rest of his Ineos squad. Perhaps in light of 2024‚Äôs lesser-than-expected result, he will be thrown into the same altitude hotel as the likes of Thomas and Foss ahead of the Tour next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carlos Rodr√≠guez pre-Tour schedule</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expected altitude camp</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-53-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although he may not be a contender, Jo√£o Almeida will play a crucial role in this year‚Äôs Tour de France. Given that Adam Yates buried himself at the Giro, Almeida will become Pogaƒçar‚Äôs right-hand man at this year‚Äôs edition. His results so far in 2025 demonstrate at uptake in form, with the Tour de Romandie already under his belt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Portuguese rider joined Tadej Pogaƒçar at the group‚Äôs altitude camp in Sierra Nevada. Almeida was even captured playing Fifa by teammate Rune Herregodts, who is not currently expected to be on the Tour de France shortlist. Regardless, Almeida has caught attention with his performances at altitude ‚Äì¬†while in Spain, he smashed Juan Ayuso‚Äôs KOM on the Alto del Purche, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we‚Äôve managed to find a Tour contender who‚Äôs not down to ride the Dauphin√©. Almeida is instead hoping to claim the Tour de Suisse title after finishing in second place last year. However he‚Äôll have to fend off the aspirations of Geraint Thomas, Felix Gall, Ben O‚ÄôConnor and Sasha Vlasov to claim <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-trophies-in-pro-cycling\">the hourglass trophy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the Tour de Suisse, which concludes on June 22nd, Almeida will briefly head to altitude before travelling to northern France for the Tour, which starts just under two weeks after the Swiss race‚Äôs final stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jo√£o Almeida‚Äôs pre-Tour schedule:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tour de Suisse</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Altitude camp (Location TBC)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other contenders</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/Adobe-Express-file-54-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the other Tour contenders, the consensus is a little more split on which warm-up race to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, the French favourites will all be heading to their home race: the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©. Among them, we will see Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious), Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ) and Aur√©lien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) all in action next week. Other secondary favourites to consider at the Dauphin√© include Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Enric Mas (Movistar), Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek), Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike), Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) and Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There‚Äôs more of a Germanic and Anglo-Saxon theme to the Tour de Suisse‚Äôs startlist. The biggest names to compete there will be Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Jayco-AlUla), Tao Geoghegan Hart (Lidl-Trek), Sasha Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Felix Gall (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale), Lennart Van Eetvelt (Lotto) and Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, there is no racing on the cards for EF Education-EasyPost‚Äôs Richard Carapaz, who will be recovering from last month‚Äôs Giro d‚ÄôItalia. Likewise, fellow South Americans Dani Mart√≠nez (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Einer Rubio (Movistar) will be resting up after competing in the Corsa Rosa. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'get the magazine for people who love cycling, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-preparations-2025\">How are the favourites preparing for the Tour de France 2025?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c2dc50763f55097851ad295090a4f88fef812c0fd567736fdb378014b322cf48","category":"Cycling"}
