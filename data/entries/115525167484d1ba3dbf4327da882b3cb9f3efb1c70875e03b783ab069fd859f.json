The battery is removable if you wanted to dump 1,850g (~4.1lbs), or add the 950g range extender and get after it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of mondraker NEAT lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-6-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mondraker’s Zero Suspension System mounts the shock between the linkages, letting it float between them, which gives them very supple small bump performance and removing braking forces from the equation. For the NEAT, they closely mimicked the analog Foxy’s design rather than the taller Crafty, which keeps the weight lower on the bike. It also allows for more seatpost insertion so you can run longer dropper posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of mondraker NEAT lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike gets a new, lighter swingarm that’s also more compact, which they say expresses a new look for the brand going forward. The top tube hides a Fidlock accessory mount underneath it, so you can add another bottle, pouch, etc., and comes with a Fidlock bottle mount on the downtube that works with the range extender battery’s mount for quick, secure installation. (You can also stick it in a bottle cage, but this is definitely more secure)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of mondraker NEAT lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-7-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike keeps their Forward Geometry, which pushes the reach really far forward and pairs it with ultra-short stems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1127\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of mondraker NEAT lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5-800x501.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5-768x481.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mondraker-NEAT-lightweight-e-mountain-bike-5-1536x962.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Key numbers include a 64.5º head angle, 76.5º effective seat angle, 450mm chainstays, and 25mm BB drop.
