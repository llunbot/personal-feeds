This includes the Magic Keyboard Folio, 11-inch Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil 2, and MagSafe Duo Charger.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/accessories-snow.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This is about $5 higher than the previous Amazon all-time low price, so it's still a solid deal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$40 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for $89.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMoving to the iPad keyboards, Amazon is discounting the Magic Keyboard Folio to <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLFH8RC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\"><strong>$169.00</strong></a>, down from $249.00. This keyboard works with the 10th generation iPad, and Amazon's new sale price is now the steepest discount we've ever tracked for this accessory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLFH8RC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$80 OFF</div>Magic Keyboard Folio for $169.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you have an 11-inch iPad Pro, you can match it with the 11-inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0931V9M9D%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\"><strong>$199.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $299.00. This one is available in both White and Black colors, and it's another best-ever price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe only downside is Amazon's current shipping estimate, which has a generous one to four week estimate for shipping. This still guarantees a delivery by Christmas, so if you're looking to buy it as a present and want to take advantage of this solid discount, now is definitely the time to buy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0931V9M9D%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$100 OFF</div>Magic Keyboard (11-Inch iPad Pro) for $199.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, Amazon has the MagSafe Duo Charger for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08MWR2NXZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$98.50</strong></a> this week, down from $129.00. Woot had this accessory for around $94 last week, but that sale has now expired and Amazon's is now a solid second-best price for anyone who missed Woot's discount.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're looking for just the MagSafe Charger, that Woot sale is still available. You can get it for <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-21%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_21\"><strong>$29.99</strong></a> in new condition (with bulk packaging) over there, which beats Amazon's current sale by about $5.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08MWR2NXZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$30 OFF</div>MagSafe Duo Charger for $98.50</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can find <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/best-early-black-friday-apple-deals/\"><strong>all the Apple Black Friday Deals currently available</strong></a> in our dedicated post.
