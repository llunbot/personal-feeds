It is unclear when the head strap will be released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the Vision Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2023, Apple showed someone wearing the headset with both a Solo Knit Band and a head strap, and it even offered members of the press that combination when they demoed the device. However, that head strap was never made available to the public. In addition to the Solo Knit Band, the Vision Pro ships with the Dual Loop Band, which has a pair of upper and lower slimmer straps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-over-head-strap.jpeg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1144\" /><em>Apple showed the Solo Knit Band with a head strap at WWDC 2023</em></div>\r<br />\nSome customers find the Vision Pro to still feel heavy on the face even with the Dual Loop Band. In response to this feedback, it seems likely that Apple partnered with Belkin to come up with a head strap for use with the Solo Knit Band after all.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/\">Belkin</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/02/belkin-head-strap-for-apple-vision-pro/\">Apple to Sell Belkin Head Strap for Use With Vision Pro's Solo Knit Band</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-sell-belkin-head-strap-for-use-with-vision-pros-solo-knit-band.2441839/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07047d5b701606199b96b29d86876afcb542f3ef9d758464ef1ab1e2ec1001f1","category":"Apple"}
