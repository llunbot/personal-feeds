{"title":"watchOS 10: Everything you need to know about the next Apple Watch update","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html","date":1686066730000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is often accused of charging too much money for its products, but some of the company’s most momentous releases are free. Such as the annual major software updates for the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, which unlock a raft of new features at no extra expense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, in fact, the watchOS 10 software update (cost: $0) is considerably more significant than what is expected from this year’s hardware. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> (likely cost: $399 and upwards) has been labeled “anything but major,” whereas the new OS was expected to bring “bigger enhancements, including an updated interface.” We now know what those enhancements entail, and this is indeed a blockbuster of an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is our watchOS 10 deep dive, sifting through what Apple announced at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC 2023</a> to bring you the best available information about its release schedule, hardware compatibility, and range of interface changes and new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>watchOS 10 release date: When will watchOS 10 arrive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We anticipate that users will be able to download the final version of watchOS 10 on September 8, 2023, but Apple is cagey about the exact launch date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>watchOS 10 was announced at WWDC 2023 on June 5, but it won’t be ready for the general public until later in 2023. The next version of the Apple Watch operating system has now entered a lengthy beta testing process. It will finally become available for official public download in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final releases generally appear in September (watchOS 9 was released on September 9 in 2022), at roughly the same time as the year’s new iPhones and Apple Watches are introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the schedule for watchOS 10:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>June 5:</strong> watchOS 10 is unveiled at the WWDC keynote presentation.</li><li><strong>June 5:</strong> First developer beta is released.</li><li><strong>July:</strong> First public beta is released.</li><li><strong>June-September:</strong> A series of betas are released, gradually getting closer to the final product.</li><li><strong>September:</strong> watchOS 10.0 is rolled out to the public.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>watchOS 10 will be accompanied by four other operating system updates, of which the most significant will probably be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-wishlist-dynamic-island-time-machine-clock-sync-ios-apps.html\">macOS 14</a> for the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>watchOS 10: How to install the beta and full version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once watchOS 10 is here for real, installing it on your Apple Watch will be easy. Simply open the Watch app on the companion iPhone, make sure you’re in the My Watch tab, then go to <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> and follow the onscreen instructions. You may need to update the iPhone first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you don’t want to wait until September, you could <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350193/watchos-public-beta-install.html\">try out a beta of watchOS 10</a>. To do that, you’ll need to join <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">Apple’s beta program</a> and understand that some features on your watch might break. Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1782726/macos-watchos-beta-process-profiles-apple-id.html\">streamlined the beta process</a>, so you’ll only need to sign into your Apple ID to get betas on all of your devices, and you can easily switch them off if you want to stop receiving them. In the same <em>Software Update</em> tab, you’ll see a new <em>watchOS 10 Beta</em> tab that will let you switch from watchOS 9 updates to watchOS 10 ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>watchOS 10 compatibility: Which Apple Watches can run watchOS 10?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, watchOS 10 runs on the same devices as watchOS 9. That means the Apple Watch Series 4 and later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent pattern had been for Apple to trim its list of compatible models every other year. In 2018, watchOS 5 dropped support for the first-gen Apple Watch; in 2020, watchOS 7 dropped the Series 1 and 2; and in 2022, watchOS 9 dropped the Series 3. That’s why it is no real surprise that watchOS 10 refrains from swinging the axe, and the Series 4 will live for one more year–although it may not get access to the full range of new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, each version of watchOS also has a list of compatible iPhones, and watchOS 10 requires a companion iPhone XS, iPhone XR or later running iOS 17. Which means that the iPhones X, 8 and 8 Plus have been dropped–none of these phones can run iOS 17, and this means they can’t be used with watchOS 10 watches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>watchOS 10: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At WWDC Apple announced a number of new features coming to Apple Watch later this year, including a new simplified way to navigate the interface and quickly access content, redesigned apps, more focus on Widgets via the Smart Stack, and new cycling and hiking features. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Smart Stack</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Smart Stack is accessible from any watch face with a turn of the Digital Crown. It’s a context-sensitive collection of widgets that watchOS has determined are relevant to your needs right now, based on the location and time of day, and your habits. (The Weather widget might appear prominently at the beginning of the day, for example, while the Timer widget will be visible when you’ve set a timer). This means, in theory, that widgets can be shown when they’re needed and hidden when they’re not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can long press to add a widget to the Smart Stack. Widgets appear overlaid on the watch face so it’s still visible in the background. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-Smart-Stack.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"watchOS 10 Smart Stack feature\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-Smart-Stack.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-Smart-Stack.jpg?resize=300%2C163&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-Smart-Stack.jpg?resize=768%2C418&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-Smart-Stack.jpg?resize=1200%2C653&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-Smart-Stack.jpg?resize=1536%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-Smart-Stack.jpg?resize=2048%2C1114&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"653\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Control Center </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch’s quick-access page of toggles and settings is going to be available from the side button as of the launch of watchOS 10. This should be a little easier than the current method (swiping up from the bottom of the screen), which sometimes goes wrong, especially when done from within an app. The dock, which in watchOS 9 is triggered by pressing the side button, is now accessed by double-tapping the Digital Crown from any watch face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also double-press the Digital Crown to go back to the last used app from Control Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New watch faces </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two new watch faces coming in watchOS 10: Palette and Snoopy. With Palette a variety of colors and overlapping layers change and shift throughout the day. It’s a relaxing, minimal face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Snoopy watch face, a similar idea to the Mickey/Minnie Mouse and Toy Story faces that have proved popular in the past, brings Snoopy and Woodstock from Peanuts to the Apple Watch. They can join in with your workout, interact with the clock hands and react to the weather.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"watchOS 10 hero image\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-hero.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption>Palette is second from left. Snoopy is second from right, obviously.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fitness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are changes coming to the Activity app that are designed to make it easier to track daily movement and view more details. There are also sharing improvements and a redesigned trophy case coming. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Fitness+ will get new trainer tips.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cycling </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WatchOS 10 is adding new features specific to cyclists. Cyclists will see a Live Activity on their iPhone once the cycling workout is triggered on the Watch, and if tapped, this will expand to take up the whole screen. This way, if your iPhone is mounted on the bike, you can utilize the space of the iPhone’s larger screen to view workout data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will also be new Workout views, including Heart Rate Zones, Elevation, Race Route, Custom Workouts, and a new Cycling Speed view. And new algorithms will be able to estimate Functional Threshold Power (FTP) and calculate personalized Power Zones for cyclists to help them improve performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also more support for Bluetooth-enabled cycling accessories, such as power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors. In other words, cyclists have no excuse for slacking off. On your bike.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-cycling-features.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Cycling features in watchOS 10\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-cycling-features.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-cycling-features.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-cycling-features.jpg?resize=768%2C426&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-cycling-features.jpg?resize=1200%2C666&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-cycling-features.jpg?resize=1536%2C853&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-cycling-features.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"666\" /><figcaption>It’s easier to view your workout data on the iPhone’s larger screen, but try not to get distracted.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hiking </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are improvements coming to the Compass app in watchOS 10. The Compass app will store Waypoints that might be useful to hikers, such as the last time they had a cellular connection. There is also a Last Emergency Call Waypoint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Elevation view uses altimeter data to produce a 3D reproduction of saved Waypoints. And Maps will display a topographic map with contour lines and elevation details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will be able to search for trails and see details such as length, type, and difficulty (this will be U.S. only initially). </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-Maps-topography-230605.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"WatchOS 10 – topographische Karten\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-Maps-topography-230605.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1306w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-Maps-topography-230605.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-Maps-topography-230605.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-Maps-topography-230605.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-Maps-topography-230605.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-Maps-topography-230605.jpg?resize=1240%2C1240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-watchos-10-a-milestone-update-for-apple-watch/&amp;xcust=1-1-1792869-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Health</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mindfulness app will gain some features to support mental health with users able to log their emotions and daily moods, and the Health app will provide resources to help users identify their risk level for depression and anxiety, including assessments available in the app itself.

An Apple Watch will be able to measure the amount of time its owner spends in daylight during the day, using its ambient light sensor.

Apple has focused on utilising more of the Apple Watch display for more “glanceable information.” </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"watchOS 10 app redesigns\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2318w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?resize=1200%2C676&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?resize=1536%2C865&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?resize=2048%2C1154&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watchOS-10-app-redesigns.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" /><figcaption>From left: the redesigned watchOS 10 versions of Weather, Activity, and Messages.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Stocks, Weather, and Music, for example, all now feature full-screen background images to match the company, conditions, or artist.

As it stands, Apple Watches need to be paired to one iPhone and <em>only</em> one iPhone at a time. Analyst941, who did leak accurate Apple information in the past, said the feature would allow Apple Watches to “sync across multiple iOS/iPadOS/Mac devices” and that they “will no longer be tied to one single iPhone.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fairness, the ex-leaker said he was uncertain whether this was a watchOS 10 feature or planned for a future release, and it may have been pushed back to next year’s watchOS 11.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5006af0ba26940b91787579ac6c340235ecdf9499032c5c88137414c6c592f1f","category":"Apple"}
