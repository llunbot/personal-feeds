A few years back, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/how-did-all-this-science-get-here/\">looked at one answer to that question</a> in the form of a book called <em>The Invention of Science</em>. In it, British historian <a href=\"https://www.davidwootton.com\">David Wootton</a> places the origin within a few centuries of European history in which the features of modern science—experiments, models and laws, peer review—were gradually aggregated into a formal process of organized discovery.</p>\n<p>But that answer is exquisitely sensitive to how science is defined. A huge range of cultures engaged in organized observations of the natural world and tried to identify patterns in what they saw. In a recent book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358251796/?tag=arstech20-20\"><em>Horizons</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.poskett.com\">James Poskett</a> places these efforts firmly within the realm of science and arrives at his subtitle: \"The global origins of modern science.\" He de-emphasizes the role of Europe and directly dismisses Wootton's book via footnote in the process.</p>\n<p>Whether you find Poskett's broad definition of science compelling will go a long way to explain how you feel about the first third of the book. The remaining two-thirds, however, are a welcome reminder that, wherever it may have started, science quickly grew into an international effort and matured in conversation with international cultural trends like colonialism, nationalism, and Cold War ideologies.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984378#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984378&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ecb9d861fe539f8cfa5ded0d6d08b28bc2abae18d6e8087e5ad9c5b258d20cbf","category":"Tech"}
