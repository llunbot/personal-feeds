The CMA also flagged the lucrative arrangement where Google pays Apple billions annually to remain the default search engine on iOS devices, noting this deal \"significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth companies have made some concessions since the CMA published its preliminary findings <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/apple-browser-rules-stifle-innovation-cma/\">last November</a>. The report acknowledges these improvements have \"addressed some, but not all, of the concerns relating to choice architecture,\" specifically mentioning Apple's December software update that modified how users can change default browsers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, to address the remaining issues, the regulator proposed several potential remedies including forcing Apple to allow alternative browser engines on iOS, implementing browser choice screens during device setup (similar to the one found in the EU), and restricting the revenue-sharing search deal between Apple and Google.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese recommendations aren't immediately enforceable, as the CMA is first proceeding with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/uk-probes-apple-google-mobile-ecosystem/\">separate</a> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-googles-search-services\">investigations</a> to determine whether Apple and Google should be designated with \"strategic market status\" (SMS) under the UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act. The designation is expected to be decided later this year, and would give the CMA authority to impose stricter regulations on the companies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf granted SMS designation, Apple and Google could face legally binding conduct requirements and risk substantial penalties — up to 10% of their annual global turnover — for violations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe cloud gaming portion of the investigation, which had previously raised concerns about Apple's App Store restrictions, concluded that \"no further action is necessary\" following policy changes Apple made during the course of the investigation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe UK report follows similar scrutiny from other global regulators, including the <a href=\"https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/gatekeepers_en\">European Commission</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/case/us-and-plaintiff-states-v-google-llc\">United States Department of Justice</a>, which are also examining mobile browser competition.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/uk-watchdog-apple-poor-competition-mobile-browsers/\">UK Regulator Blames Apple for Stifling Mobile Browser Competition</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-regulator-blames-apple-for-stifling-mobile-browser-competition.2452990/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e2c5cf637daee0e5bc4f6859115943bd9d5a62d3dfe6470679021ed020927139","category":"Apple"}
