But what Nintendo didn't mention during the presentation was game pricing, either for standalone Switch 2 titles or the Switch 2 Edition upgrades for existing Switch games.</p>\n<p>Nintendo announced via its website after the presentation that <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/\"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, the console's flagship launch title, will cost $50 when you buy a digital copy as part of a Switch 2 bundle. But the game will cost $80 when you buy it on its own, $30 more than the pack-in version and $20 more than the usual $60 price for first-party Switch games.</p>\n<p>Pre-order listings at US retailers that have gone live since this morning also list several $80 games—<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/browse/switch-2-hardware-and-software/0/0/?_refineresult=true&amp;_be_shelf_id=7433688&amp;search_sort=100&amp;facet=shelf_id%3A7433688&amp;povid=ets_switch2_pov\">we'll use Wal-Mart's</a> as an example. The upgraded Switch 2 Editions for a trio of Switch games—2024's <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, 2023's <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and 2022's <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>—are all going for $80, the same as <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed6053ac1ff035264fa9a89a389ba37ae839a2ff1bd4b75e916c267cfca193ce","category":"Tech"}
