The newspaper's uncredited \"Summer reading list for 2025\" supplement recommended titles including \"Tidewater Dreams\" by Isabel Allende and \"The Last Algorithm\" by Andy Weirâ€”books that don't exist and were created out of thin air by an AI system.</p>\n<p>The creator of the list, Marco Buscaglia, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/chicago-sun-times-prints-ai-generated-summer-reading-list-with-books-that-dont-exist/\">confirmed to 404 Media</a> that he used AI to generate the content. \"I do use AI for background at times but always check out the material first. This time, I did not and I can't believe I missed it because it's so obvious. No excuses,\" Buscaglia said. \"On me 100 percent and I'm completely embarrassed.\"</p>\n<p>A check by Ars Technica shows that only five of the fifteen recommended books in the list actually exist, with the remainder being fabricated titles falsely attributed to well-known authors.
