The separate battery weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). For reference, this means that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, excluding the battery, weighs almost as much as a 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, which comes in at 24 ounces (682 grams).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe weight of Apple's headset was unknown until today, but it was widely rumored to be heavy compared to competing devices. This is not necessarily the case, since while the Meta Quest 3 weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams), the higher-end Meta Quest Pro weighs 25.5 ounces (722 grams) â€“ substantially more than the Vision Pro. However, the Meta Quest Pro has a weighted battery pack at the back of the headset's headband to make it much less front-heavy and ostensibly improve comfort.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPre-orders of the Vision Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order/\">opened earlier today</a> and the device launches in the United States on Friday, February 2.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-weighs-almost-as-much-as-ipad-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro Weighs Almost as Much as a 12.9-Inch iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-weighs-almost-as-much-as-a-12-9-inch-ipad-pro.2416790/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b1c726cac4a85aef480f349d6aef211d69de822e52f654a0c2b9c06bb446cf8","category":"Apple"}
