It is working with Toyota to develop new fuel cells, targeting half the cost and 20 percent better efficiency than current-generation fuel cell stacks. But the technology should be seen as complementary to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/heres-bmws-electric-replacement-for-the-x3-production-starts-in-2025/\">battery electric vehicles</a>, not a replacement for them, BMW said.</p>\n<p>Earlier this morning, the automaker held a roundtable discussion with Michael Rath, BMW's vice president for hydrogen vehicles, who began by answering the main question I had been planning to ask well before any of the assembled journalists were called on.</p>\n<p>\"It's a fact: battery electric vehicles are more efficient in well-to-wheel than fuel cell electric vehicles. It's absolutely true that the conversion of electricity into hydrogen and back into electricity in the car generates losses and hence is less efficient than using the electricity directly,\" Rath said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047501#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047501&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
