There's just something about the basic framework that seems to lend itself to television. Showrunners and studios have clearly concluded that genre mashups with a mystery at the center is a reliable winning formula, whether it's combined with science fiction (<em>Silo</em>,<em> Bodies</em>,<em> Pluto</em>), horror (<em>Fall of the House of Usher</em>), or comedy (<em>Only Murders in the Building, The Afterparty</em>). And there's clearly still plenty of room in the market for the classic police procedural (<em>Dark Winds</em>,<em> Poker Face</em>,<em> Justified: City Primeval</em>). Even many shows we loved that were not overt nods to the genre still had some kind of mystery at their core (<em>Yellowjackets</em>,<em> Mrs. Davis)</em>, so one could argue it's almost a universal narrative framework.</p>\n<p>Streaming platforms continue to lead, with Netflix, Apple TV+, and FX/Hulu dominating this year's list. But there are signs that the never-ending feast of new fare we've enjoyed for several years now might be leveling off a bit, as the Hollywood strikes took their toll and the inevitable reshuffling and consolidation continues. That would be great news for budgets strained by subscribing to multiple platforms, less so for those who have savored the explosion of sheer creativity during what might be remembered as a Golden Age of narrative storytelling on TV.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984910#p3\">Read 124 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984910&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58e717a472b3f5f905c04266093e74b4cfecf48d395e9599a3efcaa36d4c9215","category":"Tech"}
