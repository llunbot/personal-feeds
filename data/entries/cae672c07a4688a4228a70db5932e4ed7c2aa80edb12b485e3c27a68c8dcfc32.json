Spring trade show season is upon us, and so are the awards. The Taipei Show always delivers a bunch of interesting products, and some of those come home with an award from iF Design. There are two categories of awards given out, the Gold Awards and the D&amp;I (Design &amp; innovation) Awards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From wild “Booster cranks” to hidden valves to quick release pedals, some really neat products have taken the honors; let’s take a brief look with some of the highlights:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Taipei Show 2025 Gold Award Winners </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hapet LiDrop Folding Bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This bike is said to triple fold in three seconds. This design uses a folding technology called a “gun-latch quick-lock” folding structure. The judges liked how the bike folded quickly, stating: “<em>The design of the folding mechanism makes the folding and unfolding of the bike incredibly easy and efficient</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-Lidrop.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"927\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-Lidrop.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners Lidrop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-Lidrop.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-Lidrop-297x215.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-Lidrop-120x87.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-Lidrop-768x556.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Taipei Show)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-ldrop-folded.webp\"><img width=\"996\" height=\"978\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-ldrop-folded.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners ldrop folded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-ldrop-folded.webp 996w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-ldrop-folded-297x292.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-ldrop-folded-120x118.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-ldrop-folded-768x754.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Schwalbe Clik Valve</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-end-of-the-presta-valve-new-schwalbe-clik-valve-has-potential-to-become-industry-standard/\" target=\"_blank\">covered</a> the Schwalbe Clik Valve last Summer and noted that it does have the potential to become a standard in the industry. It’s an innovation that is long overdue, as we’ve been putting air in our tires the same way for over a century. Time for a change! The judges liked the “<em>Thoughtful application of engineering and manufacturing to solve real problems and enhance performance, often in subtle yet significant ways</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-clik-valve.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"961\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-clik-valve.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners clik valve\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-clik-valve.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-clik-valve-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-clik-valve-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-clik-valve-768x577.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>KMC Super Duro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect for BMX and eCargo bikes, KMC says that the Super Duro chain was designed and built with a special structure. It gives it high strength without increasing its overall weight. By adding extra bushings inside the roller, they’ve increased durability by 30%. The judges say that “<em>the SuperDURO offers clear advantages over regular chains while maintaining a moderate price and weight</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners KMC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>ADR and Alpha Disc</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CeramicSpeed Alpha Disc with ADR Technology was developed in conjunction with the ADR bearing protection tech. This allows for it to seamlessly work together as part of the OSPW System design without causing friction or mechanical drawbacks. The judges think “<em>the integrated design ensures a seamless appearance, while the innovative drivetrain design enhances riding efficiency, making it a top-tier, high-quality design in the market</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners CeramicSpeed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-CeramicSpeed-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>T-Com Cycle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fairly T-Com eBike is a commuter with an elegant and clean design. It uses a unisex, step-through frame design that offers a functional and stylish ride experience. The judges loved that there were “<em>no unnecessary components, and most importantly, it rides amazingly well. The riding posture is well-balanced—not too sporty, yet not too upright</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-T-com.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1096\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-T-com.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners T com\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-T-com.webp 1096w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-T-com-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-T-com-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-T-com-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sustainable Bike Packaging (Gold Award-Green Prize)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>YFY Jupiter’s patented sustainable bicycle packaging looks different because it is. It was designed with the user experience in mind. It was also designed to enhance brand value through customizable designs, offering the end user a premium unboxing experience. The judges loved that the box “<em>replaced the previously used plastic/rubber packaging materials with fully recyclable paper, ensuring the packaging’s durability throughout the transportation process from the production facility to the end user</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-sustainable-bike-box.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"835\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-sustainable-bike-box.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners sustainable bike box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-sustainable-bike-box.webp 835w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-sustainable-bike-box-297x168.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-sustainable-bike-box-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-sustainable-bike-box-768x433.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Porto (Gold Award-Start-Up)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A cargo eScooter? Yup, that’s right. Introducing the Porto cargo eTrike. Designed to be a game changer in the “last mile delivery market”. It offers a substantially more compact, efficient &amp; versatile platform to transport all kinds of stuff. The frame was designed specifically for cargo applications, by creating a high-volume loading space. The judges think that the Porto is “<em>an exciting innovation in the last-mile delivery segment. Its design is well-thought-out and expertly executed, making the vehicle not only safe and efficient but also highly practical</em>.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-porto.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1100\" height=\"619\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-porto.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners porto\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-porto.webp 1100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-porto-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-porto-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-porto-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Taipei Show 2025 Design &amp; Innovation Award Winners</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>RST e-Tak Bike Suspension System</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-generated products are becoming a market trend. RST had the idea to combine AI tech with shock absorbers. By using algorithms to detect road vibrations, the front fork will make the proper adjustments to the damping automatically. In theory, this would eliminates the need for the rider to make mechanical adjustments. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-RST-E-tack.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-RST-E-tack.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners RST E tack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-RST-E-tack.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-RST-E-tack-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-RST-E-tack-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-RST-E-tack-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Booster Crank</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the ergonomic principles of traditional cranks, the Booster Crank introduces a new type of power-increasing crank. This new crank allows the legs to “continuously operate in cyclic circular motion to easily actuate huge power” and places the pedal mount on a separate lever arm from the main crank arm. When using existing bicycles to test the product, they claim to have found an increase of power by 50%. Hmmmm…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-power-cranks.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"788\" height=\"707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-power-cranks.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners power cranks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-power-cranks.webp 788w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-power-cranks-297x266.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-power-cranks-120x108.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-power-cranks-768x689.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trojan Vmax</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This claims to be an “invisible” high-volume tubless valve. The Trojan Vmax allows users to easily seat tires without removing the valve core and use a standard bike pump. It’s also designed to prevent sealants from clogging/blocking the valve. You can inject sealant directly into the valve without the need to remove it. They also claim that because it is hidden in the rim profile that it will help minimize inertia and improve aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trojan.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"905\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trojan.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners trojan\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trojan.webp 905w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trojan-297x219.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trojan-120x88.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trojan-768x566.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>KMC GO Waxed Chain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed with long-term sustainability in mind, the KMC GO Waxed Chain uses biodegradable wax materials in place of traditional lubricants. This will extend the lifespan of the product as well as be environmentally friendly. Plus, when using this chain, you can say goodbye to greasy, hard-to-clean chains and organic solvents. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-GO-Wax.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-GO-Wax.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners KMC GO Wax\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-GO-Wax.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-GO-Wax-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-GO-Wax-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-GO-Wax-768x433.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-KMC-GO-Wax-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>TRP EASI A12</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed with Bosch and made exclusively for eMTB applications, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-trp-autoshift-app-updates/\" target=\"_blank\">TRP E.A.S.I. A12 electronic drivetrain</a> will improve the rider experience with automatic shifting. Optimizing gear selection based on cadence, speed, and load, this drivetrain promises to reduce issues like gear mismanagement and wear. This drivetrain will give the rider smoother rides, lower maintenance, and customizable settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1120\" height=\"747\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners trp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp.webp 1120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-trp-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flatbike Pop-Off Pedals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve all done it, moved our bike through a tight spot, and either smacked the pedal and damaged something, or took a chunk outta your shin while pushing your bike. Plus, sometimes when storing a bike, the pedals become an issue. Pop-Off Pedals might have a solution, as they claim to be the “bike industry’s most rugged, and yet most easily used, removable bike pedal.” The threaded axle stub stays on the bike, and it looks like a quick release mechanism allows for tool-free removal or installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-pop-off-pedals-e1742924058844.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1032\" height=\"538\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-pop-off-pedals-e1742924058844.webp\" alt=\"Taipei Show's 2025 Gold Award Winners pop off pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-pop-off-pedals-e1742924058844.webp 1032w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-pop-off-pedals-e1742924058844-297x155.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-pop-off-pedals-e1742924058844-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taipei-Shows-2025-Gold-Award-Winners-pop-off-pedals-e1742924058844-768x400.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>One-Handed Operation Pump Head</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This innovative pump head might just be a game changer when it comes to how we interact with tire inflation devices.
