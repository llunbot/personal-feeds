Apple has been working on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a> for more than a decade and invested millions of dollars into development before deciding it was not a viable project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-yellow.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams today told approximately 2,000 employees working on the ‌Apple Car‌ that the project was canceled, and the information reportedly came as a surprise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWork on the ‌Apple Car‌ is winding down and many of the people that were working on the car will move to Apple's artificial intelligence division to work on generative AI under AI chief John Giannandrea.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a number of hardware engineers and car designers that were on the ‌Apple Car‌ team, and there will be layoffs. Some of the employees may be able to shift to other divisions within the company.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this year, there were rumors that the ‌Apple Car‌ project had been scaled back, with Apple abandoning plans for a full driverless car with autonomous capabilities. Apple shifted focus to an electric vehicle with fewer self-driving features, and the vehicle would have been on par with Tesla's technology. Apple was aiming to release the car sometime around 2026, but now those plans have been shelved completely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNews of the ‌Apple Car‌ first surfaced in 2014, and since then, the project has been rife with problems. The focus of the work has changed and evolved multiple times, and Apple has had several leadership changes due to internal strife. Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/kevin-lynch-apple-car-project/\">took over the project in 2021</a>, and he worked to scale down the project while still putting out a viable car.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>, senior Apple executives made the decision to wind down the ‌Apple Car‌ project in recent weeks.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/\">Apple Cancels Electric Car Project</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-cancels-electric-car-project.2420570/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e78b8de7fdd65135f03100d4530269ec7613cde02a812b9d48ffcfd2ee9c50de","category":"Apple"}
