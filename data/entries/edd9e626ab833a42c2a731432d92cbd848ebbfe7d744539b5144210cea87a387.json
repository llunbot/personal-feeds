As the title implies, youâ€™ll now be able to control your GoPro, control your existing ANT+ smart lights (from any vendor), and control the music on your phone.</p>\n<p>Note that while the other pieces are here today, the GoPro integration isnâ€™t lit up yet. Wahoo doesnâ€™t quite yet have a timeframe for it, as itâ€™s been delayed slightly to work out some kinks. Nonetheless, Iâ€™ll give you a quick 2-second tour.</p>\n<p>The smart light control and music control pieces are live as of today, whereas the GoPro integration isnâ€™t quite live yet.</p>\n<h3><strong><u>Bike Light Control:</u></strong></h3>\n<p>First up, is the lighting control. This leverages ANT+ connectivity to let you connect to any ANT+ lights. These can be from Garmin, Trek, Bontrager, See.Sense, Cycliq, Cannondale, and many others over the years. Note that they *must* be ANT+ enabled lights, not just general smart lights. For example, Lezyne has some smart/wireless lights that use their own protocols, but they didnâ€™t adopt the existing ANT+ standard.</p>\n<p>In any event, youâ€™ll go into the pairing menu to pair up each light individually. Ensure that you do power it on first of course, and then they should show up. Here, I did the rear light first:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3369 2.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3369-2.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Once paired, itâ€™ll take a couple of seconds to appear in the sensors list (at the top), and then youâ€™ll see a new control panel (per sensor/light) that lets you control the state of the light (brightness level/flashing/etcâ€¦), as well as see the battery status:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3370.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3370-1.jpeg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /> <img title=\"IMG_3371.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3371.jpeg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /></p>\n<p>I then went and paired up the front light, and got the same control panel:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3375.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3375-1.jpeg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /> <img title=\"IMG_3376.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3376.jpeg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, thereâ€™s a new option in the Wahoo ELEMNT app, that you can toggle on to automatically turn on/off the lights when your ride starts/stops (the recording of the ride). Note that this implementation is a bit different than Garminâ€™s in that thereâ€™s no â€˜light networkâ€™ formed. Each light is basically controlled individually, rather than an entire cohesive group. In most scenarios, that probably doesnâ€™t matter too much if youâ€™re using the automatic on/off option anyway. But, figured Iâ€™d point out that difference.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>GoPro Integration:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Next, thereâ€™s the upcoming GoPro integration. This allows you to control your GoPro camera with the Wahoo BOLT V2 &amp; ROAM V2, switching between modes, and starting/stopping recording.</p>\n<p>To begin, youâ€™ll be pairing your GoPro much like any other sensor on the Wahoo unit. Starting on the GoPro side, youâ€™ll go into the Bluetooth pairing menu, akin to how youâ€™d pair a GoPro app or remote. Then, over on the BOLT or ROAM, youâ€™ll go to add a sensor (just like youâ€™d add a power meter or heart rate sensor). Here, youâ€™ll see the GoPro listed:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3355.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3355.jpeg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>Simply tap Save, and youâ€™re done.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3356.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3356.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>How it enumerates in that list seems to vary slightly though with each time I did it:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3357.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3357.jpeg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>Next, itâ€™ll automatically add a GoPro control page to your list of pages. This page lets you switch between the different GoPro â€˜presetsâ€™ that you have, switch between photo/video/timelapse, and finally and most important: start/stop recording. Itâ€™ll also show battery status of the GoPro, as well as the SD card storage remaining (albeit in beta, slightly mixed up hours/mins/seconds). Guess I donâ€™t need that 512GB card I bought yesterday after all! ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3344.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3344-1.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Youâ€™ll see the exact config profiles listed on the screen (e.g., 5.3K/50FPS/SuperView), though the custom names youâ€™ve given (e.g. â€˜Epicâ€™ in my case), arenâ€™t pulled over.</p>\n<p>You can press up/down to iterate between the different video modes, and then press the â€˜Modeâ€™ button to iterate between the Video/Photo/Timelapse options. It takes roughly 1 second for it to make the changes, or start recording. Once you start a recording, itâ€™ll also show the recording time at the top.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3360 2.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3360-2.jpeg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>Now, as noted, the feature isnâ€™t yet available today â€“ there seems to be a few quirks on it. Itâ€™s unclear to me if theyâ€™re using a private API, or the semi-public GoPro API for this. Other companies,<a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/11/coros-adds-gopro-control-komoot-route-sync-and-more.html\"> like COROS</a>, have used the public API in the past, and honestly, they are often very finicky, namely around how the camera re-connects after you turn it on (or turn the bike computer on). Which usually requires re-pairing each time.</p>\n<p>I did though test out dual-control from both from app and bike computer at the same time, and it happily accepted commands from both, and kept sync across all three devices:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3365.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3365.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>In any case, more testing once itâ€™s ready/released.</p>\n<h3><strong>Music Control:</strong></h3>\n<p>Last but not least (ok, itâ€™s least), itâ€™s music control. This lets you control any â€˜musicâ€™ on your phone, from the ELEMNT. Albeit, itâ€™s more than just music. Itâ€™s really anything that comes via the phoneâ€™s standard music controls. That can be podcasts, YouTube, etcâ€¦ As long as the standard phone music player is playing it, you can control it.</p>\n<p>This includes Volume, Pause/Resume, Skip Forward/Back, and then the app name playing (e.g. Spotify), as well as the name of the track/song/etc and the artist. This feature will automatically show up if youâ€™ve got something playing on your phone, and shows like below for the <a href=\"http://www.dcrainmaker.com/podcast\">FIT File Podcast</a>:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3350.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3350.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Or, like such for music:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_3352.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/03/IMG_3352.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Response times seem to be sub-second, in terms of how quickly it changes things. Note that, somewhat disappointingly, they didnâ€™t put any album covers in that giant empty white space on the unit. Would have been a nice touch.</p>\n<p>With that â€“ thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"edd9e626ab833a42c2a731432d92cbd848ebbfe7d744539b5144210cea87a387","category":"Cycling"}
