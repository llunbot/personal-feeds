The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. With the ‌iPhone‌ 17, Apple will apparently bolster the hardware to a 24-megapixel camera with a six-element lens. Kuo says that the upgrade will significantly improve the image quality of the front-facing camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 6S</strong>: 5-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 4P lens</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 7, iPhone X, and iPhone XS</strong>: 7-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 4P lens</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and iPhone 13</strong>: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 5P lens</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16</strong>: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/1.9 aperture, autofocus, and 5P lens</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 24-megapixel front-facing camera with autofocus and 6P lens</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels is noteworthy because it would allow for greater detail and clarity in images. With a higher resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, providing more flexibility in post-processing. Additionally, the larger number of pixels can capture finer details, making the images sharper and more vibrant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe upgrade to a six-element lens would also slightly enhance image quality. Each element can be designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos. The additional elements can also improve the efficiency of light transmission to the sensor, enhancing low-light performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is worth noting that the ‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/\">expected</a> to be the first ‌‌iPhone‌‌ to feature under-panel <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> technology, which could reduce the size of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, but a circular cutout for the front-facing camera is expected to remain. The ‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera.
