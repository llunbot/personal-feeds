The launcher headed north from the launch pad on the coast of South America, aiming for a polar orbit about 480 miles (775 kilometers) above the Earth.</p>\n<p>The sole payload was Sentinel-2C, a remote sensing platform set to join Europe's fleet of Copernicus environmental satellites. The multibillion-dollar Copernicus system is the world's most comprehensive space-based Earth observation network, with satellites fitted with different kinds of instruments monitoring land surfaces, oceans, and the atmosphere.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047033#p3\">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047033&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1987bab55c2029f35434eb5cf964942edf234e59366995a44791467cc5fe115b","category":"Tech"}
