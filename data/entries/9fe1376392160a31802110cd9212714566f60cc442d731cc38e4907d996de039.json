I mean this literally, as YouTube \nspokesperson Jessica Gibby just emailed me the following \nstatement: “We’re excited to see Vision Pro launch and we’re \nsupporting it by ensuring YouTube users have a great experience in \nSafari. We do not have any specific plans to share at this time, \nbut can confirm that a Vision Pro app is on our roadmap.” </p>\n\n<p>This of course follows YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24043540/youtube-spotify-apps-apple-vision-pro-visionos\">all \ndeclining to allow their iPad apps</a> to run on the Vision Pro \nbefore launch — and the last time we asked, there was no mention \nof a proper visionOS YouTube app coming in the future, so \n<em>something’s</em> changed in Mountain View. (One theory: the immediate \npopularity of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24059005/juno-youtube-vision-pro-app-christian-selig\">Christian Selig’s Juno app for YouTube</a> on the \nVision Pro.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is Juno so good that it might have altered Google’s development plans for supporting YouTube with a native app? I suppose that’s possible. But given the design quality and adherence to platform design idioms of Google’s iOS apps (poor), I’m not sure they’re even capable of making a Juno-quality app.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also unsure whether Google cares, ultimately, that Juno is and will remain the premier client for YouTube on VisionOS for the near future. Because Juno is mostly just a redesigned presentation of youtube.com, it doesn’t block ads. If you don’t like YouTube ads you should sign up for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/premium\">YouTube Premium</a> (which of course works great in Juno) — one of the best bang-for-your-buck values in all of media.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/08/youtube-visionos-on-the-roadmap\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9fe1376392160a31802110cd9212714566f60cc442d731cc38e4907d996de039","category":"Tech"}
