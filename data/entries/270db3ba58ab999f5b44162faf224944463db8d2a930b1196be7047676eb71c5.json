As spotted by <em><a href=\"https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/mute-toets-mac/\">iCulture</a></em>, the key now displays a speaker with a strike through it – matching the actual on-screen indicator that appears when you press it in macOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor over two decades, the Mute key has confusingly shown just a speaker icon, providing no obvious visual indication that it silences your Mac. Meanwhile, pressing it would display a completely different but more accurate symbol on screen: a speaker with a line through it. To be fair, it is a toggle key that both mutes and un-mutes audio, but the new mute icon more recognizably informs what the key does – just like on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> Remote.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/old-mac-keyboard-mute.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"949\" /><div><em>Mute key symbol on previous Mac keyboards</em></div>\r<br />\nThis small but meaningful correction resolves a surprising design inconsistency that has persisted through countless keyboard iterations across dozens of Mac models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/new-mac-keyboard-mute.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"949\" /><div><em>Mute key symbol on new ‌MacBook Air‌</em></div>\r<br />\nThe redesigned Mute key isn't limited to the ‌MacBook Air‌, either. The new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>'s Magic Keyboard also incorporates the corrected icon. In fact, you could call this a \"double upgrade\" for ‌iPad Air‌ users, as previous Magic Keyboard models have lacked function keys entirely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe keyboard change is typical of Apple's meticulous attention to detail, even if it took more than a quarter-century to implement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt seems likely that all future Mac models will adopt this revised Mute key design. The next expected release, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> with M5 chip anticipated around October, will presumably incorporate the updated key icon. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/new-macbook-air-corrects-design-mistake/\">New MacBook Air Quietly Fixes This Decades-Long Design Oversight</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-air-quietly-fixes-this-decades-long-design-oversight.2452424/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"270db3ba58ab999f5b44162faf224944463db8d2a930b1196be7047676eb71c5","category":"Apple"}
