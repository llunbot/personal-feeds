Depending on the climate, riding intensity and style, and sensitivity to cold, it can be challenging to find one pair of gloves that can protect the hands well on every ride throughout the colder months. Fortunately, there are models made to suit every temperature range, weather condition, and specific need. In fact, for something as simple as a glove, the amount of variety on the market is incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help navigate the choices, review author Bennett Shane spent months testing a diverse selection of 15 winter cycling gloves in a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. From chilly autumn morning starts to drizzly and cold mountaintop summits, each pair was put through its paces to see how they perform in the real world, and most importantly, how they compare to each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you need something thin and lightweight for riding in mild conditions, something insulated and waterproof for frigid training rides, or anything in between, our top recommendations are listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are all worthy options in their own right. You can check our <strong><a href=\"#comparison-chart\">comparison chart</a></strong> to see all of the models we tested at a glance, and our <strong><a

Espresso GT Glove</a> is the best all-around winter glove we tested. While it does not win outright on any individual criteria, it’s clearly the glove of choice for riders who only want to buy one pair of gloves that will protect them for a few hours of riding during 95% of the conditions that winter will throw at them. </p><p></p><p>To be fair to the Espresso GT, its comfort is absolutely top-shelf and we’d quickly point out that its breathability is simply on another level compared to similarly warm models. That’s important because conditions in winter are highly variable, day to day, hour to hour, minute to minute. Changes in ride intensity relative to speed, changes in altitude, changes in precipitation, and wind speed all conspire to make keeping hands comfortable a tricky test. </p><p></p><p>The Espresso GT features PrimaLoft Gold insulation along with a GORE-TEX membrane that makes them completely waterproof and windproof. While Castelli isn’t explicit about what makes the Espresso GT breathe so well, this is really what separates it from other gloves offering a similar level of warmth and protection. Why this breathability is so important isn’t about extreme cold, but rather more mild conditions. Most gloves in this category are not useful above the mid-40s F and thus leave a gap where they are way too warm. Thanks to their impressive breathability, this gap all but disappears with the Espresso GT.</p><p></p><p>This leads us to another great feature of the Espresso GT, which is the zippered back. While other gloves offer a nice flexible cuff, the Espresso GT goes further, opening up completely thanks to a YKK zipper that runs from the cuff to the knuckle area. This makes removing and refitting the Espresso GT mid-ride super easy, which is a nice upgrade over all the other winter gloves we tested.</p><p></p><p>At $120, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-espresso-gt-glove-mens\">Castelli Espresso GT Glove</a> sits at a high price point but offers a corresponding level of performance thanks to a pitch-perfect blend of warmth, waterproofing, breathability, and ease of getting in and out. If you only want one glove for anything winter will throw at you, the Espresso GT is the one to buy.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Waterproof Knit Gloves</a> from Showers Pass provide excellent protection from the rain to keep your hands dry while cycling. The Crosspoint Gloves are fully waterproof with 3 bonded layers: a wear-resistant knit exterior that feels like a regular knit glove, a waterproof-breathable Artex membrane, and a Coolmax moisture-wicking antibacterial knit lining.</p><p></p><p>What makes the Crosspoint shine is their simplicity and supple comfort during the ride, especially considering how much protection they provide against rain and wind. The Crosspoint gloves are barely noticeable after a few minutes on the bike because they fit and articulate so well. When the intensity ramps up, there is no loss of control or feedback through the handlebar, making the Crosspoint glove a great choice for fast group rides and road races. Silicone print on the palm provides a reliable grip in wet conditions. </p><p></p><p>While the Crosspoint Waterproof Knit gloves fit and feel like just about any other knit option, Showers Pass ups the ante with the Artex membrane. Most knit gloves only provide moderate protection from wind and little, if any, protection from water, so this really expands the versatility of these gloves to a much wider conditions range.</p><p></p><p>At just $47, the Crosspoint is a great value and outperformed a few gloves we tested that were nearly double the cost. Showers Pass also keeps the branding on these gloves subtle, so they pair well with whatever winter kit you choose to wear.

Merino Gloves</a> is a bit of an oversimplification. While they are 20% Merino wool, there are a host of other materials, mainly nylon and polyester, that help them fit and perform better than a 100% merino glove ever could. Thankfully, these gloves still feature that soft and natural comfort we associate with wool fiber. </p><p></p><p>Before even putting on the merino glove, we knew they would be comfortable, just from their appearance. The blended fabric is clearly well-sourced and has a nice density to it. The Merino Gloves are not articulated, but that’s not necessary for a high-quality merino-blend fabric in this application, as its stretch allows it to conform perfectly to the individual shape of the hands and fingers. The Bluebird color scheme of our test pair is brilliant and gives the merino glove a cheerful look that actually makes us want to wear them. The subtle Ornot patch on the cuff also matches the pattern of the grippy texture applied to the palms, giving them a subtle yet classy style. </p><p></p><p>Getting the merino gloves on was even easier than expected, because the cuff is ribbed and the wrist hem is reinforced, making it easy to tug on this part of the glove to get them in place. These gloves make a great “just in case” option for rides that start or end in colder weather, or feature long descents. Keep them in your pocket until your hands are cold, and they will still be super easy to put on, even while riding. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the Ornot merino gloves also work great for rides that start cold and stay cold. They pack a surprising amount of protection for such a lightweight and simple glove. A big reason why they stay comfortable in cold conditions is that they breathe well, preventing any chilling effect from clammy hands. Yet, there is enough density in the weave of the merino blend to block light to moderate wind.</p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a lightweight, packable glove that excels in mild to moderately cold weather, such as the mid/low 40s F, the reasonably priced <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fmerino-gloves-blue%3Fvariant%3D40134842777665\">Ornot Merino Glove</a> is a great choice. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fmerino-gloves-blue%3Fvariant%3D40134842777665\">Check Price at Ornot</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Cycling Gloves For Wet And Cold Days\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fdeep-winter-gloves%2Fproduct%2FDWG05XXBLK&amp;platform=pl\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRapha Deep Winter Gloves\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$190</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Windproof nylon outer, breathable OutDry® membrane;

These gloves are aptly named and are honestly overkill for what most riders are willing to venture out into during the dark and cold months. But for those of us who road ride just as much in the winter as in the summer, these are a wise investment in comfort.</p><p></p><p>Built with a bevy of technical layers, including a waterproof and breathable OutDry membrane, as well as PrimaLoft insulation, it’s fair to say that your enthusiasm to ride might fade before you hit conditions these gloves can’t handle. We’ve ridden them in sleet, hail, and wind chill into the single digits, for century rides and beyond, and never once lost feeling in our fingers. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Rapha Deep Winter Gloves is on par with their excellent protection. Because of the articulated shaping, these ride like much thinner gloves. There is just enough freedom inside to allow the hand to relax and move naturally, which is vital to maintaining circulation and comfort. Although Rapha offers a merino liner (sold separately) to go inside, we think it would need to be exceptionally cold for that to be necessary. </p><p></p><p>Getting into the Deep Winter Gloves isn’t hard, assuming you’re still at home and your hands are still warm. Thankfully, a wide Velcro strap ensures that the generously sized, flexible cuff is sealed completely against cold air and moisture.

The look of these gloves is a bit different, and dexterity isn’t their strong suit, relative to less protective, more stretchy gloves, hence the reference to lobster claws. </p><p></p><p>However, when you consider that the ring finger and pinky do virtually nothing for shifting and braking, while the warmth gained from the split-finger design is substantial, the AmFib Lobster Evos make a lot of sense. It’s a function-over-form product, and when it’s below freezing and we’re 20 miles from home, the look of our gloves is about the furthest thing from our mind.</p><p></p><p>Digging deeper into the technology of the AmFIB Lobster Evo Gloves, we find a 170g PrimaLoft Gold insulation w/Crosscore technology, which provides supreme warmth while minimizing bulk. The AmFIB fabric that constitutes the main body is highly water-resistant and windproof but also articulates easily to the position of riding on the brake hoods. An Ax Suede Laredo synthetic leather palm makes the AmFIB Lobster Evo Glove as grippy as it is durable. A 3D-shaped gel pad provides bar comfort without any loss of feedback or control at the handlebar. </p><p></p><p>One of the drawbacks to a glove like the AmFIB Lobster Evo is that it might be able to protect against conditions that you’re just not that interested in riding in. This is a glove for folks who live and ride where winter is harsh and relentless and isn’t just a game of waiting for mild conditions to go outside. Likewise, while you are still able to use the pointer and middle fingers independently, these gloves are simply bulkier than lighter options, and therefore dexterity and tactility are slightly limited as a result. Given the right conditions, however, that is a tradeoff that most people are willing to make for warm hands. </p><p></p><p>If you routinely face sub-freezing temps or maybe have issues with keeping your hands warm in the upper 30s to low 40s with traditional five-finger glove designs, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F224361%2Fpearl-izumi-lobster-evo-cycling-gloves%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Pearl Izumi AmFIB Lobster Evo Glove</a> is a great pick.

The No Rain Gloves also feature a dense pattern of silicone across the un-padded palm for exceptional grip and dexterity whether shifting, braking, sprinting, or taking a selfie. </p><p></p><p>What impressed us most about the No Rain Gloves, however, was how incredibly comfortable they are. From the moment we put them on, our hands felt cradled by their soft interior, which provides balanced stretch and light compression across every part of the hand and fingers. Every seam is positioned correctly to avoid irritating or restricting the fingers, which helps them achieve a level of comfort that its rather simple construction hides nicely. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the No Rain Gloves feel weightless and take away nothing from the control and feedback we are accustomed to when riding gloveless. Depending on the intensity of the ride, the No Rain Gloves can protect against temperatures as low as the upper 30s F, provided it’s dry. At a more chill pace, the No Rain Gloves can breathe well enough to be comfortable into the low 50s. The sweet spot is high 40s F, with light precipitation. The No Rain material not only expels small amounts of water readily, but also seems to adapt to a humid environment to become even more comfortable. </p><p></p><p>Those who live in mild but damp winter climates could get a lot of use out of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8MWKF6/?tag=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves-20\">Sportful No Rain Gloves</a>.

The top panel on the back of the Merino Glove is a merino blend that is 38% merino wool, and 62% nylon. The weave of the top panel is a waffle pattern that encourages body heat to insulate the hand until it turns to sweat vapor, then wicks away quickly. </p><p></p><p>One of the reasons some folks avoid wearing gloves is that palm padding can take away from handlebar control or even affect bike fit in some cases. Thankfully, the Rapha Merino Gloves have no padding and the AX Suede palm is thin and provides a great bar feel so controlling the front of the bike feels just like riding gloveless.</p><p></p><p>Designed to slide seamlessly under jacket sleeves, the ribbed cuffs are elasticated for a secure fit, with a pull tab making for easy removal. While they are not designed for steady rain, they can protect your digits from road spray on long wet descents, or a moderately damp road race or group ride.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmerino-gloves%2Fproduct%2FKMG01XXDTE&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Merino Gloves</a> are a great option for mild conditions, from the upper 50s to mid/low 40s, depending on intensity.

This type of fabric increases loft to keep warm air close to the skin to insulate the hands, while the Airblock membrane fends off the bitterly cold winds of winter.</p><p></p><p>The fit of the Ultraz Gloves is excellent, assuming you choose the correct size. These ran smaller than we expected, and our tester’s hands were cramped and restricted in the size large Ultraz on his typically size large hands. So, size up and you’ll be able to enjoy how well the Ultraz articulates to the position of riding on the brake hoods. </p><p></p><p>The Ultraz Gloves feature a neoprene cuff to seal out the elements and fit easily under most jackets’ wrist cuffs. A Microfiber palm and padding keep hands comfortable on the bars. On the outboard side of the pinky finger, a reflective fabric lends a hint of visibility for the low light conditions of winter riding. </p><p></p><p>As is the case with much of the Assos winter collection, the Ultraz Winter Glove does not protect against steady rain and road spray. The Ultraz gloves are hydrophobic enough to cope with light and intermittent moisture for a long time though. Being designed in Switzerland, this makes sense, as this alpine climate has little rain in the winter, but a consistent pattern of snowy stretches punctuated by cold, windy, dry days. </p><p></p><p>So, if that sounds like the climate where you ride, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fassos-ultraz-winter-gloves-black-series-l-p13.52.532.18.l%2Fp1529169%3Fv%3D1526034\">Assos Ultraz Winter Gloves</a> could be a great pick.

The gloves work well in temperatures ranging from cool to cold, depending on riding intensity, and conditions between dry and damp. </p><p></p><p>Gore-Tex Infinium is one of the most popular and effective materials in the world of cycling apparel, as it is highly water-resistant, blocks wind, and breathes easily, thanks to its densely woven but lightweight composition. It provides a nice balance of moderate warmth and good weather protection for riding in light, intermittent showers, or on unpredictable weather days. The microfiber palm is soft and padded for a nice balance of support and cushioning, along with a great feeling of control and feedback on the handlebars. Silicone texture applied to the areas that interface with the brake hoods further bolsters confidence in wet weather. </p><p></p><p>The velcro closure ensures that winter stays out, and a microfiber panel down the center of the inner wrist helps increase grip when sliding the WS Essential 2 Gloves on and off. The length of the cuff also ensures gap-free coverage of the wrists when worn with a cycling jacket. The WS Essential 2 Gloves are also available in a nice selection of colors that can coordinate or contrast with many of Sportful’s most popular winter jackets. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRTS5J8/?tag=brbgapparelroadwintergloves-20\">Sportful WS Essential 2 Gloves</a> are comfortable across a wide range of temperatures from the mid-50s down to the high 30s F, possibly even lower at very high intensity, making these a sensible option for the conditions experienced most often during early season training and racing.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRTS5J8/?tag=brbgapparelroadwintergloves-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-perfetto-light-glove\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCastelli Perfetto Light Glove\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$60</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>100% polyester</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS-XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Works With Touchscreens</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Nose Wipe</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Winter Cycling Gloves of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Castelli-Perfetto-Light-Glove-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Handles light rain/spray well</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent grip</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Cuff could be more substantial</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Limited temperature bandwidth</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-perfetto-light-glove\">Perfetto Light Gloves</a> from Castelli are highly adaptable to a wide range of conditions, because they stand up resolutely to cold wind and light rain, but also offer excellent breathability and are supremely light. The key to the Perfetto’s versatility is GORE-TEX Infinium fabric, which provides complete protection from wind and a high level of water resistance in a thin material that never feels clammy or heavy, even if temps or the ride intensity soar. </p><p></p><p>The Perfetto Light Glove features the Castelli Damping System (CDS) on the palm to absorb jarring vibrations.

We categorize these as nice jersey-pocket insurance against cold that hasn’t yet arrived, or as a temporary glove to wear until both body and temperature have warmed up enough to go gloveless. There is a narrow sweet spot where they are just right, between about 42 degrees and 52 degrees F. They aren’t quite insulated enough for temps below 40°, and above 52° they feel too insulated and can’t breathe sufficiently from within. </p><p></p><p>The palm is synthetic suede and features gel padding in the ulnar nerve region, along with silicone stripes across the top of the palm for added grip. The back of the Giara Thermal Gloves is made of a windproof face and a soft-brushed interior. The overall feel is luxurious and dexterity is well-preserved.</p><p></p><p>The cuff is a stretchy double layer and forms a pleasantly tight seal against the wrist to keep wintery conditions out. A hearty pull tab features on the cuff to help ease getting them on and off. All the seams are placed intelligently to pamper the hand and fingers without irritation.</p><p></p><p>By forgetting the “Thermal” label, these gloves immediately performed better in our minds. Sometimes, there’s a lot in a name, and if it’s just not a very accurate one, that can be distracting. So, if you’re looking for a solid glove for cold starts or twilight chilliness, and tend to go gloveless above the low 50s, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y22MYC1/?tag=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves-20\">Sportful Giara Thermal Gloves</a> could be an excellent pick.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y22MYC1/?tag=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fassos-spring-fall-gloves-evo-black-series-l-p13.52.540.18.l%2Fp1439352%3Fv%3D1436979\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAssos Spring Fall Gloves Evo\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$80</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Brushed textile, microfiber palm, foam padding</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waterproof</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS – XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Works With Touchscreens</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Nose Wipe</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1122\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Winter Cycling Gloves of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo.jpeg 1122w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Assos-Spring-Fall-Gloves-Evo-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great dexterity</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Durable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Works with touchscreens</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not warm enough for proper cold conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Kinda expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Although only named after two seasons, we could see the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fassos-spring-fall-gloves-evo-black-series-l-p13.52.540.18.l%2Fp1439352%3Fv%3D1436979\">Assos Spring Fall Gloves Evo</a> being used year-round, especially for those of us who like to experience the golden hour. These are the ultimate gloves for staying 100% comfortable when there is just a slight chill in the air, as there often is as the sun is just breaking the horizon or about to disappear beyond it. </p><p></p><p>Another thing we love about these gloves is that although they would never be described as “burly,” they could definitely be called “bomber,” and look like they will probably outlast most bikes. Since most of our most used gloves end up with split seams and relegated to the trash bin, it’s nice to see Assos taking durability seriously, especially in a glove that costs $80 and isn’t necessarily all that warm. </p><p></p><p>We love Assos products, but versatility is not a high priority for the luxury cycling brand from Switzerland, and this glove is further evidence of that observation. Many people would probably just suck it up and go without gloves in the slim temperature range where the Spring Fall Evo glove is most effective, which is from about 48-55 degrees F. And many still would go gloveless even below where these gloves are only marginally better than bare hands. In other words, these are another niche offering from a company that arguably has every niche dialed in perfectly. </p><p></p><p>If you see that narrow temperature range as another opportunity to ride

Izumi’s Thermal Gloves</a> prioritize dexterity and handlebar feel in cool conditions. We loved stashing them in pockets for long chilly descents during rides that were otherwise warm enough to go gloveless. We also utilized the Thermal Gloves on chilly starts and twilight rides into the late-autumn sunset, which always seem to arrive way too early and bring with them a biting chill.</p><p></p><p>The soft microfiber palm of the Thermal Glove is both durable and quite supple and provides an excellent grip and feel on the bars. The index finger and thumb feature a conductive material that is touchscreen-compatible for simple tasks on smartphones and touchscreen cycling computers. The back of the Thermal Glove features a brushed thermal fabric for warmth and comfort with no excess bulk.</p><p></p><p>The Thermal gloves have an extended slip-on cuff that fits neatly under the wrist cuffs of most cycling jackets. They are also available in Arctic Blue as well as black and the branding is super minimal, matching the simple and functional vibe of this glove. </p><p></p><p>The Thermal Glove is thin enough to be used as a supplemental liner inside of a much thicker glove during extreme cold. On their own, we can recommend them for temps as low as 45 F, but not much lower, as the material isn’t dense enough to effectively block wind. Conversely, this lack of density helps the Thermal Glove breathe well enough to keep on into the high 50s F when desired.</p><p></p><p>At just $30, the <a

Us</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bikerumor, we truly enjoy riding outside and we don’t stop when the days get shorter, the temperature drops and the weather is less than ideal. Instead, we know that having the right gear can make riding through the fall, winter, and spring just as enjoyable as the warmer months of the year. In addition to gloves, other gear like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">bib tights</a>, jackets, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-shoe-covers/\">cycling shoe covers</a> can help you stay comfortable and elevate your ride experience while keeping you off the indoor trainer. We’re also very passionate about gear, and we’ve been reporting on and testing the latest and greatest products for well over a decade while providing trustworthy reviews to our readers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our winter cycling gloves buyer’s guide, we tapped review author Bennett Shane to test all of the gloves in this review. Bennett has been cycling for over 20 years, and while his racing days are behind him, he still rides obsessively for fitness, fun, and, of course, testing gear. Bennett is a year-round outdoor road cyclist who lives in Portland, Ore., where he experiences every weather condition imaginable and knows the importance of having the appropriate apparel and accessories to enhance his comfort and enjoyment on the bike when it’s cold and wet, which it often is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bennett also spent many years working for numerous prominent brands in the cycling industry which has given him a unique insight into materials, designs, constructions, and technologies across the spectrum of cycling products. His depth of knowledge is uncanny. His cycling, product testing, and industry experience combine to give him a keen ability to analyze the often subtle performance differences in the products he tests. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How We Tested Winter Cycling Gloves</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best winter cycling gloves on the market, we rounded up a diverse selection of 15 models for side-by-side testing. Bennett closely examined the fit, materials, construction, design, and features before testing them for months in the highly variable fall weather of the Pacific Northwest. From crisp morning and evening rides to freezing cold and wet rides through the mountains, each pair was put through its paces in a range of temperatures and weather conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While testing, Bennett carefully considered fit, comfort, bar feel, and warmth, along with wind and weather protection. Noses were wiped, touchscreens were touched, and wrist cuffs were analyzed for how well they interface with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-jackets/\">best cycling jackets</a>. When testing concluded, we chose our favorites overall and those that stood out for specific reasons compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Cycling-gloves-testing.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Cycling-gloves-testing.jpeg\" alt=\"Review author Bennett Shane testing winter cucling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>Review author Bennett Shane spent months testing winter cycling gloves in the variable weather of the Pacific Northwest; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buying Advice: How to Choose Winter Cycling Gloves</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many different winter cycling gloves on the market, finding the right pair to suit your needs perfectly can be a daunting task. One of the most important things to consider is the conditions you expect to encounter most often, as that will dictate what level of weather protection or insulation you will need. An individual’s sensitivity to cold and/or typical riding intensity are also important factors that may influence this decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Winter Cycling Gloves</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With so much variability in the weather and temperatures where cyclists live or choose to ride in, there are just as many different styles of winter cycling gloves to match. Of course, depending on the climate where you live, what you consider to be cold temperatures or miserable weather may vary as well. Sometimes a single model may have you covered, although for some people it may be necessary to invest in more than one pair to cover all your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Castelli-Perfetto-Light.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Castelli-Perfetto-Light.jpeg\" alt=\"Close up image of the Castelli Perfetto Light winter cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>Sometimes it’s in the name. The Castelli Perfetto Light gloves are indeed a thin and light option for cool temperatures; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cool Weather</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it, the vast majority of cyclists are heading out for fall, winter, and spring rides when the temperatures are cool, but not downright frigid. For cool but relatively mild temperatures in the 40° to 55° F range, there are lots of options to take the edge off the wind and provide a tiny bit of insulation to keep your digits warm while providing better dexterity, bar feel, and breathability than heavier, bulkier models. If you’re used to riding gloveless or in summer-weight gloves, it can be shocking just how much warmer a pair cool weather gloves can be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, cool-weather gloves are thinner and lighter than beefier cold-weather options and typically consist of a light wind-blocking shell or possibly even have a knit construction. Some cool-weather gloves also feature water-resistant or waterproof membranes to keep rain or road spray from soaking your hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Showers-Pass-Crosspoint-Waterproof-Knit.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Showers-Pass-Crosspoint-Waterproof-Knit.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Knit winter cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>The Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Knit gloves magically combine a super comfortable knit construction with a waterproof membrane; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring and fall rides and early mornings or brisk evenings are typically when these gloves are the most effective. Not surprisingly, gloves with <em>Spring Fall</em> or <em>Light</em> in the name usually fall into this category like the Assos Spring Fall Gloves Evo and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-perfetto-light-glove\">Castelli Perfetto Light</a>. Similarly, gloves with knit constructions like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fmerino-gloves-blue%3Fvariant%3D40134842777665\">Ornot Merino</a>, Rapha Merino, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F134885%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-knit-gloves%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Shower Pass Crosspoint Knit Waterproof Gloves</a> are light, dexterous, tactile, and very comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Castelli-Espresso-GT.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Castelli-Espresso-GT.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Castelli Espresso GT winter cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>When temperatures are right around or just below freezing, an insulated glove like the Castelli Espresso GT keeps your hands warm and dry; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cold Weather</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When temperatures are hovering just above or just below freezing, it’s officially cold. For these conditions, gloves with insulation and wind-blocking materials are needed to fight the chill of the wind and maintain warmth around your hands. These gloves typically work well in the 20-40-degree range and some will also be waterproof or highly water resistant to protect against rain showers and road spray. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, cold weather gloves work well within their temperature range, though they can quickly become too warm if/when used in temperatures above that. While they typically try to balance warmth with breathability, the addition of insulation can sometimes make them trap moisture more than thinner cool weather models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PrimaLoft is a commonly used type of insulation that is often found in cold-weather cycling gloves. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-espresso-gt-glove-mens\">Castelli Espresso GT Glove</a> is one such example that includes PrimaLoft Gold insulation along with a GORE-TEX membrane that aims to keep you both warm and dry in properly cold winter conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fassos-ultraz-winter-gloves-black-series-l-p13.52.532.18.l%2Fp1529169%3Fv%3D1526034\">Assos Ultraz Winter Gloves</a> are warm enough for temperatures around the freezing mark without being bulky. They don’t pack the same level of weather protection as the aforementioned Castelli Espresso GT, but they work very well in the cold, dry conditions they’re designed for.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Deep-Winter-1.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Deep-Winter-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Close-up view of the Rapha Deep Winter winter cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>When it gets really cold, a glove like the Rapha Deep Winter, pictured here, or the Pearl Izumi AmFIB Lobster Evo is key to keeping the cold, wind, and wet from ruining your ride; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Extreme Cold</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When it’s really cold and you absolutely must ride outside, having gloves that can keep your hands from freezing is absolutely critical for comfort and control. Gloves designed for extreme cold include insulation, wind- and weather-blocking material, and often have designs to enhance warmth or seal out the elements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though we didn’t test any two-piece gloves, some winter gloves will have a liner and outer glove that are separate pieces so you can layer up for extra protection or adjust as needed. Additionally, a separate, thin-liner glove can often be used with bulkier outer gloves to increase their warmth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it gets really cold, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F224361%2Fpearl-izumi-lobster-evo-cycling-gloves%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Pearl Izumi AmFIB Lobster Evo</a> is one of the gloves we’re happy to be wearing. With Primaloft insulation, a windproof and water-resistant AmFIB membrane, and the lobster-style design, these gloves keep your hands and fingers happy on bitterly cold days. S</p>\n\n\n\n<p>imilarly, the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fdeep-winter-gloves%2Fproduct%2FDWG05XXBLK&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Deep Winter Gloves</a> are made to stand up to harsh conditions. With a wind and weatherproof Outdry membrane, Primaloft insulation, and a double cuff to seal around your jacket sleeve, these gloves keep both the cold and water at bay to keep you spinning when everyone is still at home. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Sportful-no-rain.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Sportful-no-rain.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Sportful No Rain winter cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>For lots of riders, a highly water-resistant glove like the Sportful No Rain is a great option for handling light to moderate amounts of precipitation and road spray; (photo/Benett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wet Weather</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of us try to avoid riding in the rain, some people seem to revel in it or simply can’t avoid it if they want to ride outside. For most riders, however, rain is usually in the form of passing showers on unsettled weather days and the resulting road spray from wet roads. Either way, when you factor in cold temperatures with wet conditions, you’ve got a recipe for some very cold hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping your hands dry will significantly increase your comfort and your hands’ ability to stay warm. There are many gloves designed to handle wet weather on the market, and they span across all of the above-mentioned temperature ranges. How brands approach this varies, however, with different materials and levels of water protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some gloves are highly water-resistant, but not fully waterproof, and aim to balance breathability with enough weather protection for most wet situations short of riding in full-on rainstorms. These gloves will often use a wind-blocking and highly water-resistant membrane, like GORE-TEX Infinium, in their construction, like the Sportful Essential WS 2 gloves. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8MWKF6/?tag=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves-20\">Sportful No Rain Gloves</a> use the brand’s <em>No Rain</em> water-repellent fabric to effectively defend against light to moderate rain and road spray. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some gloves go all-in on wet weather protection with fully waterproof membranes to keep the water out. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-espresso-gt-glove-mens\">Castelli Espresso GT Gloves</a> are one such example that uses a Gore-Tex waterproof membrane to seal out water while still providing admirable breathability. Similarly, the Rapha Deep Winter Gloves employ an Outdry wind and waterproof membrane that works in roughly the same way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knit gloves are not typically associated with robust wet weather protection, but the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F134885%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-knit-gloves%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Knit Gloves</a> turn that notion on its head. With a waterproof Artex membrane sandwiched between the knit outer and Coolmax liner, these gloves provide the comfort and fit of a knit glove with full protection from the rain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Merino-Gloves-fit.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Merino-Gloves-fit.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Rapha Merino winter cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>In addition to choosing the right gloves for the conditions, a good fit is critical for comfort and performance.

Gloves that fit well feel like an extension of our body and avoid being too tight and restrictive or too big and loose. Too big and there can be excess material that can bunch and irritate the skin or your hands can move around inside resulting in a reduction of control. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having too much space inside an insulated glove can also have a negative impact on its ability to maintain warmth. Too small and gloves glove can feel constricting, potentially impacting dexterity, or worse, restricting blood flow that is critical to keeping your hands warm in cool conditions. We want our gloves to fit just right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us already know our glove size, so this is typically a fairly easy step in the process. For most gloves, you’ll simply want to go with your regular summer-weight gloves size and it should be a good fit. If you’re considering wearing a liner glove underneath a heavier glove, however, you may want to size up slightly to ensure there’s room to fit comfortably. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re unsure of your size, most brands have detailed size charts that should help you figure it out with a few measurements. Of course, heading to a shop and trying gloves on is a surefire way to ensure you get the right fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Assos-Ultraz-Winter-cuffs.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Assos-Ultraz-Winter-cuffs.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Assos Ultraz Winter cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>Extended cuffs, like those on the Assos Ultraz Winter Gloves, add protection for the wrists and fit nicely under the cuffs of cycling jacket sleeves to help seal out the elements; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wrist Cuffs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When wearing winter cycling gloves, it often means that we’re also wearing a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-jackets/\">cycling jacket </a>of some kind, and the wrist cuffs of most gloves are designed to integrate well with jackets. Most gloves have relatively low-profile wrist cuffs, and many are extended slightly up the wrist so that they slide under the cuff of a jacket sleeve to provide protection for the wrist where they meet. The wrist cuffs of the models we tested vary in design, however, with some being simple, stretchy, pull-on affairs while others may use a Velcro tab or zipper to open the cuff further to ease entry and exit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What works best for you is often a matter of personal preference. A design that we really liked is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-espresso-gt-glove-mens\">Castelli Espresso GT</a> with a back-of-hand zipper that allows the gloves to open wide and get warm hands in and out super easily. Another is the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fdeep-winter-gloves%2Fproduct%2FDWG05XXBLK&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Deep Winter Gloves</a> with their double cuff design. A sung cuff wraps around the wrist with an outer shell cuff that can be used to sandwich the cuff of the jacket sleeve between them for a great seal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Cycling-gloves-palm-detail.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Cycling-gloves-palm-detail.jpeg\" alt=\"Close up view of the silicone textured palms on the Sportful No Rain cycling gloves\" /></a><figcaption>Silicone texture on the palms of some gloves, such as the Sportful No Rain gloves pictured here, works to provide extra grip in the hoods and bars; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Palm</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The palm of a cycling glove is important because it serves as the interface between our hands and our handlebars. Not only is this interface important for our control of the bike, but it also plays a role in our comfort. In general, we look for palms that provide excellent grip and a very direct, connected feel to the bars that is as similar as possible to the feel of not wearing gloves at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good palm designs are articulated to the hand in the riding position and avoid bunching while being as thin as possible (within reason depending on the intended use) to transmit feedback and bar feel. Most palms are made from synthetic materials that mimic suede providing comfort for the hands and a good grip on the hoods or bars, and many models also feature silicone strips or patterns to add additional grip which may be welcome in wet conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some gloves also feature strategically placed padding with the goal of increasing comfort. Padding is a personal preference, and some riders seem to like it while others would rather have gloves without. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Pearl-Izumi-Cyclone-Gel-touchscreen.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Pearl-Izumi-Cyclone-Gel-touchscreen.jpeg\" alt=\"Close up of the touchscreen compatible fingertip of the Pearl Izumi Cyclone Gel gloves\" /></a><figcaption>The small panel of conductive material on the pointer finger of the Pearl Izumi Cyclone Gel Gloves allows you to do simple tasks on touchscreens; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Touchscreen Compatibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it or not, touchscreens have become a major part of our lives. Whether on our smartphones or our cycling computers, touchscreens are everywhere and we can’t even seem to get away from them while we ride. Whether for navigation, responding to a text, taking a scenic or riding shot, or answering work emails mid-ride, being able to use a touchscreen without taking your gloves off is pretty nice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many gloves, but certainly not all, are designed to work with touchscreens through the use of conductive threads or conductive materials used on the tips of the pointer finger and thumb. How well these features actually work varies slightly, but most will allow you to perform simple tasks on screens with some performing better than others. One of the primary factors that influences the functionality is the thickness of the gloves themselves. The slimmer fitting and less bulky the fingers are, the easier it is to do things on a touchscreen, generally speaking. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Pearl-Izumi-Lobster-Evo.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/11/Pearl-Izumi-Lobster-Evo.jpeg\" /></a><figcaption>The large, soft, nose wipe panels on the thumbs of the Pearl Izumi AmFIB Lobster Evo gloves is great when riding in the cold conditions these gloves are designed for; (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nose Wipe</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it’s cold outside, our noses are more likely to be runny and we still produce sweat when we’re putting in some effort, so a soft wipe for your nose and/or sweat is a nice feature on many models of gloves. These wipes are typically on the thumb of the gloves and are made from a soft, absorbent material. While a nose wipe isn’t a make-or-break feature, it is something that we’ve come to appreciate and prefer to have for riding in cool weather if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, cycling gloves are relatively affordable compared to many of the other parts, apparel, and accessories we buy for this sport. Given the fact that riding in the cold, wet, or both can be miserable without a good pair of winter cycling gloves, we feel that it is generally money well spent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like anything else, you can spend a lot on a pair of cycling gloves, but you certainly don’t have to find something that will help enhance your cool weather or winter riding experience. Of course, more advanced materials, designs, and constructions drive the price up, and often the gloves made for the most extreme conditions cost the most. While some of our favorite models also happen to be the most expensive, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-espresso-gt-glove-mens\">Castelli Espresso GT</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fdeep-winter-gloves%2Fproduct%2FDWG05XXBLK&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Deep Winter</a> gloves, there are other quality options that sell for a lot less and work quite well too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F134885%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-knit-gloves%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Knit Gloves</a>. These affordable gloves are not only super comfortable, but they’re waterproof and they retail for just $47. If you ride in relatively mild and dry conditions, then something like the Ornot Merino or the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fproducts%2Fthermal-gloves-14142008%3Fvariant%3D40648903655595\">Pearl Izumi Thermal</a> will do the trick for just $39 and $30, respectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do I need winter cycling gloves?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>f you plan to ride in the fall, winter, and spring, or even brisk morning and evening rides in the summer, the answer is yes. As soon as you encounter temperatures below around 55° F, a good pair of winter cycling gloves will help to keep you warm, dry, or both, and keep you more comfortable while you ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, while you can ride in any gloves you choose, we recommend cycling-specific gloves because they are designed for the task. Cycling gloves have special cuts, materials, and features that simply make them work better for road or gravel riding than other options. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Which winter cycling gloves are best for me?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The winter cycling gloves that are best for you depends entirely on the temperature and weather conditions that you’ll be experiencing. This depends on your tolerance for cold, climate, willingness to ride in wet conditions, and ride intensity. No single glove will be the ideal glove for everyone, so its important to be realistic about your fall, winter, and spring riding and find the glove (or gloves) that are best suited to your needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some people, it may be a versatile option that hits the happy middle ground of warmth and weather protection, while for others it may be multiple gloves to cover the base for a wider range of conditions. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Should I get waterproof winter cycling gloves?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Whether or not you need fully waterproof gloves really depends on the conditions you expect to encounter while riding. If you intentionally go out and ride in steady rainstorms, then yes, absolutely, waterproof gloves are a necessity. If you’re like most people, however, who try to avoid that, then a water-resistant glove is often a better option that will handle the vast majority of light to moderate rains that we’re likely to encounter when the weather is unpredictable. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do I need multiple pairs of winter cycling gloves?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>For many people, having multiple pairs of winter cycling gloves is necessary to cover all of the different conditions they will encounter during the fall, winter, and spring. Cool-weather gloves for shoulder season rides, cold-weather gloves for the deep of winter, and wet-weather gloves for those days you just can’t bear to ride the indoor trainer again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone will need multiple pairs of gloves, it really just depends on the conditions that you’re willing to go outside and ride in. For many people, a versatile glove like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelbikingroadwintergloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F134885%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-knit-gloves%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Showers Pass Crosspoint Waterproof Knit</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRTS5J8/?tag=brbgapparelroadwintergloves-20\">Sportful Essential WS 2</a> gloves will work great for 99% of the cool-to-cold weather riding they do.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How much should I spend on winter cycling gloves?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Everyone’s budget is different, so there’s no right answer to how much you should spend on winter cycling gloves. The gloves you can afford are much better than none at all and better than spending more than you’re comfortably able to. But, it depends on your needs, as some of the more protective and warmer options simply cost more than lighter-weight and simpler gloves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the more niche, and typically more expensive, categories, you’ll find a wide range of prices, and even the more budget-friendly models will help you stay comfortable when you need to get outside and ride. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What other gear should I consider for riding in cold weather?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>A good pair of cycling gloves is just one element of the cold-weather riding kit. For anyone dedicated to riding outside when the temperatures are cool or cold and the weather is unstable, there are several other pieces of apparel or accessories you may want to consider. Full-length <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">cycling bib tights</a> provide full leg coverage along with wind and weather protection and insulation in some cases. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-shoe-covers/\">Cycling shoe covers</a> are a great way to keep the cold, wind, and water from chilling the feet and a good <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-jackets/\">cycling jacket</a> can do the same for the upper body. Insulating base layers and mid-layers are also great for developing a layering system to handle your specific needs for warmth. A huge range of cycling caps are offered to protect your head and ears from the elements, and face covers and/or balaclavas are helpful to protect your face as well. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-shoe-covers/\">\n\t\t<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shoe-cover-collage-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-shoe-covers/\">\n\t\tThe Best Cycling Shoe Covers of 2023\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>Without proper protection, water, wind, and cold air will conspire to punish your feet and cut your ride short.
