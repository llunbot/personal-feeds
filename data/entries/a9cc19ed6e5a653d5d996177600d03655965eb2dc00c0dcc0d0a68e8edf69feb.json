If you want an aerodynamic road bike for the extra speed on the flats, stick with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2022-orbea-orca-aero-spins-up-faster-lighter-more-integrated-aero-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Orca Aero</a>. But if you want to fly up the steep climbs – like those surrounding Orbea’s Basque HQ – it’s hard to argue with that magical feeling of stomping the pedals on a 6.7kg road bike!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Orbea Orca lightweight carbon climbers’ road bike from 680g</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Accepting that modern road bikes have essentially fallen into 3 camps – light, aero, or a combination of the two – Orbea crunched the watt-saving numbers to see when and how to prioritize weight savings vs. aerodynamics. But with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2022-orbea-orca-aero-spins-up-faster-lighter-more-integrated-aero-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Orca Aero</a> an already quicker option for fast flat &amp; rolling racing – at 30kmph the super-aero bike saves 12W, at 40 kmph 15W &amp; at 50 kmph around 28W – they decided to let the Orca refocus as a pure climber. “<em>Reducing weight by 500g on a gradient of 5% saves around 3W. If you increase the gradient to 10% the savings increase to around 6W.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Orbea Orca v7 lightweight carbon climbers road bike, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_complete-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos c.

Across the wide size range, that seems to be 680g for the 47cm frame, up to ~850g for the biggest 60cm frame. The Orca was already built with Orbea’s most premium hi-mod OMX carbon fibers, so reducing weight meant they actually needed to reduce material.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Orbea Orca v7 lightweight carbon climbers road bike, frame carbon thickness\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_frame-wall-thickness-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They got that light first by sticking with more structurally-efficient &amp; stiffer round tube shapes and only incorporating aero features that didn’t add weight. Removing unnecessary edges eliminated extra resin &amp; non-structural material, while utilizing more complex carbon pieces in the lay-up reduced the need for excess material overlap – the OMX frame uses 90 fewer pieces of carbon than the OMR bike. Then, lighter hardware (just 40g of bolts &amp; bobbles), lighter paint at just 25g, topped off with a lighter 15g clearcoat finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Orbea Orca v7 lightweight carbon climbers road bike, team testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing-297x152.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing-800x410.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing-120x62.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing-768x394.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_team-testing-1536x787.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the second-tier OMR frame which shares the same outward shape is pretty light, but at 1030g with a 410g fork you’ll save quite a lot in your budget that might make it easier to save that 330g back in components.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What else is new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Orbea Orca v7 lightweight carbon climbers road bike, clean cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Orbea-Orca-v7-lightweight-carbon-climbers-road-bike_clean-front-end-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a few aero improvements that didn’t compromise weight.

Across 7 sizes (47-60cm), pretty much all that has changed are shorter chainstays for improved acceleration, and overall shorter wheelbases for more responsive handling.
