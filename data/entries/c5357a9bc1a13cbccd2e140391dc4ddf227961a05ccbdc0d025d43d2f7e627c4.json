Hey, nice jersey, James. Because this week’s In The Drops I bring you one of the weirdest looking cycling garments I’ve ever seen. But we’ll come to that in a minute, because first, <em>what a week!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road race calendar may have drawn to a close with October’s Gree-Tour of Guangxi (Chinese company Gree is the world’s largest manufacturer of home aircon units, although it also makes some well-regarded air fryers), but we’re far from finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Robyn takes a look hard look at the year that was in our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-wrapped-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Cycling Wrapped 2024</a> list. It’s like Spotify Wrapped, only bikey and I likey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, since it’s that time of year, we also have <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-awards-2024\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cyclist</em>‘s 2024 Pro Cycling Awards</a>, as voted for by… you! Yes you guys, thank you muchly!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my favourite thing we’ve done online this week, and not just because I wrote it, is our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar profile</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for now, get in that aero tuck and get in those drops. The weekend is coming and it takes no prisoners.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Castelli Gabba R</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it a jacket, is it a jersey, is it a sure-fire way to dress to get let into Berghain? The new Gabba R might just be all three. The brief here was aero fit for wet weather gear for grimy days, and of the first point, Castelli has succeeded. This is tight. It’s very stretchy too, but there’s nowhere to hide in the Gabba, making it great for solo breakaways in the spring Classics, which is precisely what this thing was made for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike previous Gabbas (did you know the Gabba has been around since 2011, makes you feel old), the main body material, aka the shiny sexy bits, are made from a proprietary fabric with a polyurethane membrane that’s waterproof, stretches at least double its dimensions in any direction, and is breathable. This in contrast to what is best described as the softshell, neoprene-esque fabric of Gabbas old, which had a DWR coating but which ultimately was just designed to wet out and trap heat as opposed to actually deflecting the rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Seamlessly joined to the sci-fi fabric is more a recognisable Lycra-style material that’s water resistant and equally stretchy and figure hugging. The cuffs come equally aero-tight and long over the wrists, making them good at interfacing with gloves. At the rear are three pockets with mesh drain holes and a long drop tail to cover your modesty when you’re in that aero tuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall fit is the raciest thing I’ve worn in a long while, with a chest cut that pulls your arms forwards. That is, the Gabba only really feels comfortable in a riding position; stood normally the shoulders are baggy and the chest too tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Castelli-Gabba-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m partway through testing the Gabba R properly for the mag, so look out for a full review in <em>Cyclist</em> issue 160, out early next year. But for now I can say that it’s a very promising piece of kit.

It’s a lovely, very pleasing and unoffensive blue, isn’t shiny in the least and has a cut that leans towards the relaxed. Great for going over extra layers and being accommodating for a wide range of body shapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some senses this is a very simple rain jacket, but that simplicity belies the tech of the fabric, which Universal Colours claims is ‘the best performing PU waterproof material from Japan’.

That means it’s made from Trek’s OCLV 500 carbon not OCLV 700, and as such it’s theoretically slightly less stiff and practically around 400g heavier. I weighed this 56cm frame at 1,356g. Not super light like the Émonda was when it debuted as a 640g frame back in the 2017, but not bad considering that’s with hardware including the headset and spacers. The fork is 356g, the seatmast topper another 132g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why buy this frame? Well, I’m itching for a project build to keep me occupied this winter, plus there’s nothing like browsing Ebay of a cold winter’s night after drinking a bit too much, then buying things you’re unlikely – if you’re honest – to ride much before the spring. But ownership is 9/10ths participation, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don’t know why but I’ve long fancied a Trek and have ridden earlier Émondas and liked the cut of their jib. This time around, 2022 (and for the last time as the Émonda has been scuttled… although I bet my bottom bracket it will return), the Émonda got a facelift, getting aero tube shapes and 95% integrated cables (they run under the stem and in at the head tube spacer). That made it way faster than the original, close to the Gen 6/7 Madones of the day, but it did add a chunk of weight that many a tester rued. ‘The Émonda is a pure climber’s bike!’ They shouted as they wept into their Thomas the Tank Engine pillows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, I’ll make that trade for a markedly faster bike than the 2017 debut. It also got a very forward thinking for the time T47 BB and room for 30-32mm tyres (wheel and tyre combo dependent).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eagled-eyed viewers will object to say Trek officially rated the Émonda at 28mm, but I did a lot of digging and plenty of riders out there have fitted 30mm and even 32mm tyres with acceptable clearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The explanation being Trek has a +/-2mm manufacturing tolerance (an industry standard) plus determines its max tyre clearances based on a generous 6mm of clearance (at least) either side of the tyre at the fork and stays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fullness of time this will get a groupset, wheels and all the bits that make a bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But right now I’ve got a stem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the Trek/Bontrager Blendr RCS stem though, which further hides cables and I believe is backwards compatible with the right RCS spacers. So we’ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also might try and source some acceptable touch up paint, because look at that serious chain rub around the BB. The seller said was due to a poorly packed bike during air travel; all I know is despite the exposed carbon there’s a lot of meat around these BBs, so it’s really cosmetic and it’s really why this frame was so cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only time can my judge.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-inner-tubes\">Best inner tubes 2024 reviewed: TPU, latex and butyl tubes for road and gravel cycling rated</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pfas-free-rain-jackets\">Home and dry?
