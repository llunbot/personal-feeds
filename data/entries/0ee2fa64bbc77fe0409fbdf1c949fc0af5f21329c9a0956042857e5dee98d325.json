Although this is a private spaceflight, it really is not a space tourism mission. Rather, it seeks to push the ball of exploration forward. Isaacman has emerged as one of the most serious figures in commercial spaceflight in recent years, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fly into space and push forward the boundaries of what private citizens can do in space.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045232#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045232&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ee2fa64bbc77fe0409fbdf1c949fc0af5f21329c9a0956042857e5dee98d325","category":"Tech"}
