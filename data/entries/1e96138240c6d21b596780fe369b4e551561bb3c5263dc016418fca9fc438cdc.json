The Best Company Outlook award is determined based on feedback from HashiCorp employees who provided reviews on Comparably. The Marketing, Sales, and HR awards collected reviews regarding work-life balance, professional development opportunities, perks, and benefits. Because Comparably awards are determined by ratings from a company’s own employees, this recognition is especially meaningful for us. </p>\n\n<p>We’re incredibly proud of the culture we have built, and we are honored that HashiCorp employees have used their voices to share feedback that has resulted in several awards for HashiCorp. As a team, we are dedicated to creating a collaborative community that is inclusive and engaging, where every employee can show up as their authentic self, and where every employee feels empowered and is able to do their best work. </p>\n\n<p>Now, on to the awards! </p>\n\n<h2>Best Company Outlook</h2>\n\n<p>For this award, Comparably collected feedback from employees about their confidence level for the future success of the company, their excitement about going to work each day, and if they would recommend HashiCorp to a friend. To us, receiving the Best Outlook recognition lets us know that our goal of creating an environment where each employee can do their best work is being met. </p>\n\n<p>We are on a mission to build and deliver products that enable organizations to deliver essential services to the world. That means we have a big responsibility to our customers, it requires our team to be working in lock-step to deliver, and it also means each employee has an abundance of opportunity to make a significant impact while growing their careers with us. </p>\n\n<h2>Best Marketing Teams</h2>\n\n<p>Products don’t go to market or drive adoption on their own.

The marketing team aims to help users solve problems as simply and quickly as possible using HashiCorp products and technology. Rooted in truth-telling and integrity, we leverage customer insights to bring the HashiCorp story to life with data-led precision and clear, helpful information. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hashi.co/3M5C1y3\">growing</a> HashiCorp marketing team consists of product marketing, corporate marketing, worldwide field marketing, digital marketing, developer relations, community, and events. </p>\n\n<p>“It’s so exciting to see the HashiCorp marketing team recognized as a Best Marketing Team,\" said Marc Holmes, HashiCorp CMO. \"Marketing at HashiCorp is a unique experience with so much surface area and opportunity with which to build, and so it’s a privilege to serve this team and see them move each of our functions from strength to strength: creative vision, messaging, campaigns, and experiences that help to educate and inform our audiences while delivering joy and delight and earning respect and trust.
