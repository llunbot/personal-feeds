That would potentially give Apple a much lower cut of the money that Twitter is paying out to creators.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMusk said that Twitter does not plan to collect any fees from creators who earn under $100,000. After the $100k mark, Twitter will collect 10 percent of a creator's earnings, though the first 12 months will be free for all creators. If Apple agreed, Apple would be entitled to 30 percent of the 10 percent cut that Twitter takes from creators earning more than $100k.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple collects in-app purchase fees from subscription purchases that are made through the Twitter app on iOS devices. Apple earns 30 percent for the first year of a subscription, and 15 percent for each subsequent year. Apple takes the same cut of all digital purchases on the ‌App Store‌, and the Cupertino company is not known for making exceptions to its rules.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMusk's request would not work with the current in-app purchase setup as Apple is collecting its fee from each subscriber who pays a creator rather than from the creator directly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFacebook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/facebook-creator-subscription-links/\">has protested</a> the fee that Apple collects from the Facebook subscription option for creators, but Apple has not changed its policies. Facebook instead encourages people to support creators by subscribing on the web rather than on a mobile device, which is a method that Musk could use to limit the fees that Apple takes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMusk has in the past <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/03/elon-musk-criticizes-app-store-fees/\">criticized Apple's App Store fees</a>, calling the cut that Apple collects \"definitely not ok\" and likening it to a \"30% tax on the internet.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/elon-musk-app-store-lower-fees/\">Elon Musk Wants Apple to Lower Fees for 'X' Creators</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elon-musk-wants-apple-to-lower-fees-for-x-creators.2397602/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0e15a7f7f87d88cbdbf3ca338d2ec4c1c806b4f490103cd264040973cb42cdf5","category":"Apple"}
