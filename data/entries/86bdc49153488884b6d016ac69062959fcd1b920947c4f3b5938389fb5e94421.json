The list is \npopulated with “<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/\">the most downloaded browsers on iOS in that \ncountry in the prior year</a>.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This screen is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1765188112349798551\">ridiculous</a>. I find it hard to believe that anyone thinks this sort of user experience is anything but confusing to a typical user. Someone who’s been using Safari for a decade, and doesn’t even know what a “default browser” is, might have to scroll below the fold to even see Safari as an option, depending on the random order.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/\">From Apple’s developer documentation for this screen</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Up to 11 of the most downloaded browsers on iOS in that country in \nthe prior year that meet the above criteria will be selected for \nthe browser choice screen in addition to Safari. Apple will update \nthe list of browsers eligible to be shown on the choice screen \nonce per calendar year. </p>\n\n<p>The current list of browsers shown on the browser choice screen \nper country are below. The lists below are in alphabetical order, \non a user’s device browsers will be shown in a randomized order \nper user. Click on a country below to jump to it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this is a good idea for web browsers, why stop there? Why not mandate the same sort of choice screen for every app? Mail, Calendar, Notes, Weather, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/halidecamera/status/1765494543854838206\">Camera</a> — why not require all of them to show a choice screen for picking a “default”?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/06/ios-17-default-browser-nag\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"86bdc49153488884b6d016ac69062959fcd1b920947c4f3b5938389fb5e94421","category":"Tech"}
