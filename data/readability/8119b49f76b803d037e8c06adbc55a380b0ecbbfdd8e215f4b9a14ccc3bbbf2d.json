Where stupid and not-so-stupid questions alike are answered by relevant experts across the cycling industry. This week we’re answering a reader’s question about the adoption of the Horst-Link suspension design. We’re joined by Ruben Torenbeek, Managing Director of <a href=\"https://raawmtb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RAAW</a>, creators of the Madonna and Jibb full suspension mountain bikes that both use a Horst-Link layout.</p><p><strong>When Specialized owned the Horst-Link/Four-Bar patent, competitors and industry suspension gurus claimed it wasn’t very good. Now that the patent has expired, why are lots of companies now resorting to using this “not good” design for their own bikes?</strong></p><p><strong>RAAW: </strong>We’ve only been around since the patent has expired, but surely brands have become more interested in the layout now. What’s interesting here is that the Horst-Link in itself doesn’t say much about the performance of the bike.</p><figure id=\"attachment_262073\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-262073\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike.jpg\" alt=\"raaw madonna v2.2 complete bike with ohlins coil shock\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16111553/raaw-madonna-v2-point-2-complete-bike-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-262073\">RAAW recently updated the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/06/17/raaw-madonna-v2-2-frame-refined-with-improved-force-flow-more-shock-clearance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Madonna</a> to improve force flow through the rocker of the Horst-Link layout into the frame</figcaption></figure><p>You can bet that the characteristics of a bike with a Horst-Link will go in a certain direction.

A bike with a Horst-Link tends to have lower anti-rise values (braking influence). Without the Horst-Link, the suspension would be a single pivot design, meaning that that rear wheel rotates around a fixed point as it goes through the travel.

For us this meant that we could have high pedaling efficiency combined with a low amount of braking influence (active braking). The active braking allows the suspension to work uninterrupted without locking up and being harsh under braking.</p><p>But, it is important to underline that the benefits of a Horst-Link are only a small part of the big puzzle.</p><p><em>Got a question of your own?
