{"title":"Apple Events 2023: Apple’s event calendar and details of the next Apple keynote","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html","date":1692662880000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t often participate in big industry-wide events such as CES or E3. The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Apple Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these “events,” and streams them live online to millions of watchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, there were three such events: A spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. An additional event was expected in October or November but never materialized. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far in 2023, we have had one event: WWDC in June. We expect two more Apple events. Read on to find out what events and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new Apple product launches</a> the company might have in store for 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s next event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next event in Apple’s calendar will be the keynote at which the new iPhone 15 is launched. We don’t yet know when that will be, but early September is most likely. In fact, we think that it will be held on September 12 or 13. Alternatively, it could be a week earlier on September 6 or 7, in which case we’d expect invites to be issued by Apple in the week of August 22. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have lots of information about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s September 2023 iPhone 15 event</a> in a separate story. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the next Apple event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple is holding a keynote it tends to start that keynote at the same time: 10 am in California (where Apple is based). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what that translates to in the countries where most of our readers live:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: at 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Following day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does an Apple event last?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives including Craig Federighi, John Ternus, Erin Turullols, and others. WWDC and the September event tend to be longer keynotes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple hold events?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple holds three or four live or live-streamed events throughout the year where the company unveils its latest products and plans during a keynote address. They are usually held during similar times of the year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>March/April: Spring event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>June: WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>September: Fall event (aka iPhone launch event)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October: Final event</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This event calendar is by no means set in stone though, with the spring and October events being less regular. Some years, Apple doesn’t hold a spring event at all, as was the case in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer and September events are more predictable, with software coming at WWDC in June and iPhones and Apple Watches in September. The October event often sees Apple launch new Macs, but this is another one that changes from year-to-year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple events will take place in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on past history and recent rumors, here are the events we expect to see across the remainder of 2023:</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" width=\"1069\" height=\"743\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" /><figcaption>Apple launched the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro in September 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fall Event: September 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple always holds an event in September</a> where it almost always launches a new iPhone. (The only exception is 2020 due to Covid-related production issues.) Here are the past few Apple Fall Event dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2022: Wednesday, September 7<br />2021: Tuesday, September 14<br />2020: Tuesday, September 15<br />2019: Tuesday, September 10<br />2018: Wednesday, September 12<br />2017: Tuesday, September 12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are no specific rumors about the event yet, we’re expecting to see the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/new-iphone-14-2022-release-date-3808651/\">iPhone 15</a>, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and possibly a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1503167/iphone-15-ultra-pro-max-size-price.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a> to replace the iPhone 14 Pro Max. We’re also likely to see the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch 9</a>. Could there be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">new AirPods</a>? We will have to wait and see. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Late fall Event: October/November 2023 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s late fall event isn’t guaranteed to happen. In 2022, for example, there were rumors about an October event, but Apple opted to issue press releases for the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">10th-gen iPad</a> and M2 iPad Pro. Over the past six years, Apple has held three events, so it’s a 50 percent chance of happening this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2022: No event </li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple traditionally uses its late fall event to unveil new Macs and iPads. In 2023, that could mean the launch of the M3 chip, which could appear in the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1511195/imac-apple-silicon-m2-m3-update-rumors.html\">24-inch iMac</a>, but we may be waiting until 2024 for that. Another contender for the late 2023 event is a rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple events will take place in 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the events we expect to see in 2024, and what could launch:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spring Event: 2024 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no spring event in 2023, but in 2022, Apple released the iPhone SE 2, iPad Air, and Mac Studio and Studio Display, in 2021, we got the iMac, AirTag, and Apple TV 4K. And in 2019, the event was devoted to Apple’s services: Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade. Could there be an Apple spring event in 2024? It looks likely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is the event will most likely take place on a Monday or Tuesday in early- to mid-April. Here’s when Apple has held its last few spring events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2023: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Tuesday, March 8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday, April 20</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: No event due to Covid</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Monday, March 25</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, March 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know that Apple’s Vision Pro headset is set to launch in “early 2024” so a spring launch is entirely feasible. What else could we see? New <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">AirPods</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676887/apple-games-console-rumours-and-release-date.html\">gaming device</a>? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC: June 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 and nearly every other year WWDC has taken place in the first or second week of June. In 2023 the opening keynote was held on Monday, June 5 at which Apple announced three new Macs and the Vision Pro headset as well as revealing the features coming up in the various operating systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote on the Monday, developer events and sessions will run throughout the week.

New hardware sometimes makes an appearance at WWDC as well as was the case in 2023.</p>\n\nApple Inc, iPad, iPhone, Mac, Personal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b5c06e2d3adf833f06dde99d33f2812f0c12054ef6a09cee49d9270f80a0f9b2","category":"Apple"}
