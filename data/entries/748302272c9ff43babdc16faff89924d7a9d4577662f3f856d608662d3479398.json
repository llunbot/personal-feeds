The <a href=\"https://bideninaugural.org/brqrthk6dhdn94xx/\">list contains all contributors who\ndonated more than $200</a> to President-elect Joe Biden’s Jan. 20\ninauguration ceremony and related activities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That website is now defunct, and the “bideninaugural.org” domain redirects (for the next 17 days) to “www.whitehouse.gov”, but <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210120222004/https://bideninaugural.org/brqrthk6dhdn94xx/\">Internet Archive has a capture from Inauguration Day, 20 January 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Apple is not listed, and while there is a “Tim Cook” on the list, he’s listed as residing in Michigan.</p>\n\n<p>All “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration\">great American traditions</a>” have to start somewhere, and perhaps Tim Cook — the one from California, by way of Alabama — believes the great American tradition of donating money to presidential inaugural committees is only beginning now. Or, giving him the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he only saw fit to contribute $199 to Biden’s inauguration and thus wasn’t listed, and bumped his donation by $999,801 this time. You know, for “unity”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/the-great-american-tradition\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"748302272c9ff43babdc16faff89924d7a9d4577662f3f856d608662d3479398","category":"Tech"}
