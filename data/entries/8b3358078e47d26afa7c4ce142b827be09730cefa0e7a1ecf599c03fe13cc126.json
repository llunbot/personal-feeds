{"title":"'M4 Extreme' Chip Unlikely After Apple 'Cancels' High-Performance Chip","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/m4-extreme-chip-unlikely/","date":1733932343000,"content":"Apple this \"past summer\" canceled the development of a high-performance Mac chip that would have consisted of four smaller chips stitched together, in order to free up engineering resources for a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-intelligence-servers-new-chip-report/\">planned AI server chip</a>, according <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-is-working-on-ai-chip-with-broadcom\">to <em>The Information</em></a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/M4-Extreme-Cancelled.jpg\" width=\"2313\" height=\"1301\" />\r<br />\nBased on the report's description of the chip, it sounds like Apple has canceled a previously-rumored \"Extreme\" chip for the Mac. It was previously reported that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/mac-pro-m2-extreme-chip-likely-scrapped/\">\"M2 Extreme\" chip was scrapped</a> a few years ago, but perhaps Apple had revisited the idea since then. In any case, it now sounds like an \"M4 Extreme\" chip is also unlikely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple likely would have introduced the \"M4 Extreme\" in its high-end Mac Pro tower. The chip would have offered even faster performance than the M4 Ultra chip that is expected to launch in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-studio-m4-mac-pro-2025/\">new Mac Studio and Mac Pro models</a> later next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the \"M4 Extreme\" were to have been a quadrupled version of the M4 Max chip that debuted in the MacBook Pro a few months ago, it would have had massive specifications, including up to a 64-core CPU and up to a 160-core GPU.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the \"Extreme\" chip may be off the table once again, it seems like Apple has repeatedly shown interest in developing such a chip, so perhaps it will eventually materialize as part of the M5 series or later. For now, though, the wait continues.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/m4-extreme-chip-unlikely/\">'M4 Extreme' Chip Unlikely After Apple 'Cancels' High-Performance Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-extreme-chip-unlikely-after-apple-cancels-high-performance-chip.2445107/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b3358078e47d26afa7c4ce142b827be09730cefa0e7a1ecf599c03fe13cc126","category":"Apple"}
