The researchers believe it affects all VPN applications when they’re connected to a hostile network and that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when the user VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said their attack technique may have been possible since 2002 and may already have been discovered and used in the wild since then.</p>\n<h2>Reading, dropping, or modifying VPN traffic</h2>\n<p>The effect of TunnelVision is “the victim's traffic is now decloaked and being routed through the attacker directly,” a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU\">video demonstration</a> explained. “The attacker can read, drop or modify the leaked traffic and the victim maintains their connection to both the VPN and the Internet.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022250#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022250&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f64b795184903c19caa9d62c1267b3f553868f586565bcb83ef4e05c3f34f142","category":"Tech"}
