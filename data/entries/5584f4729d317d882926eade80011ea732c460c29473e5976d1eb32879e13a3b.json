(credit: Google)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Google's up-and-coming Fuchsia OS has reached another milestone. According to a report from 9to5Google's <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/google-fuchsia-update-rolling-out-widely-nest-hub/\">Kyle Bradshaw</a> (the Internet's premiere Fuchsia resource), the new OS is rolling out to all first-gen Google Nest Hubs. The OS <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-launches-its-third-major-operating-system-fuchsia/\">launched in May</a> but only to a select few devices in the preview program.</p>\n<p>The first-gen Google Nest Hub (which launched as the \"Google Home Hub\" and was later renamed) has always had a strange OS story. The smart display launched in 2018 with an OS based on the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-home-hub-under-the-hood-its-nothing-like-other-google-smart-displays/\">Google Cast platform</a> at a time when Google was pushing partners to ship displays with Android Things, an Internet-of-things OS based on Android. Today, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/google-kills-android-things-its-iot-os-in-january/\">Android Things is dead</a>—at least, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/android-things-is-no-longer-for-things-focuses-on-smart-speakers-and-displays/\">as a public platform</a>—and there's not much future in turning the simple Google Cast Platform into a smart display. The Fuchsia team, which has been experimenting on the Home Hub for years, apparently commandeered the project and started rolling out the new OS.</p>\n<p>You can check if you have Fuchsia by going to the \"About\" page in the settings. If there's an \"Operating System Version\" field at the bottom, you're running Fuchsia. You <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/06/11/google-nest-hub-fuchsia-video-comparison/\">won't notice</a> any differences, though. The Google smart display UI is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timsneath/status/1125868510645669888\">written in Flutter</a>, which can run on both Fuchsia and the Google Cast OS, so everything you interact with comes from the same code base. Google just quietly replaced the underlying OS.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788082#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788082&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5584f4729d317d882926eade80011ea732c460c29473e5976d1eb32879e13a3b","category":"Tech"}
