{"title":"Tech Tidbits: Favero MX Pro Shipping, Polar Vantage V3 Update, Garmin Beta Update","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/04/tidbits-shipping-vantage.html","date":1712696487000,"content":"<p>Just a couple of quick tidbits that are worth mentioning to round into today’s update quickie post, efficient as always. Or, at least as efficient as you’ll get around these parts.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Favero Assioma Pro MX Availability:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"FaveroAssiomaProMXBoxed.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/04/FaveroAssiomaProMXBoxed.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>After these were <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/02/favero-assioma-pro-mx-mtb-spd-power-pedal-review.html\">announced a bit over a month ago</a>, they virtually instantly shifted from available to not available. Now,<a href=\"https://cycling.favero.com/en\"> they’re back available</a> again. Favero says they’ve re-stocked components they ran short of, and are allowing people to place orders again. Frankly, this is about as simple an update as you can get. These continue to be a great unit set, and I continue to use them in testing/validation.</p>\n<p>As for the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/03/looks-blade-pedals-power-meter-pedal-hands-on.html\">Look MTB SPD &amp; Road KEO pedals</a> that were announced a week later, I literally just finally got a final-final (for real this time) set that Look is certain resolves all the issues from before. I did an initial test ride yesterday, but will be putting them through their paces again over the coming weeks.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Polar Vantage V3 Update, Grit X2 Pro Shipping:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"PolarVantageV3-UpdateFirmware.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/04/PolarVantageV3-UpdateFirmware.jpeg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>As outlined when the Polar Grit X2 Pro was announced, the Polar Vantage V3 will get the exact same firmware/features (because it’s running the exact same internal hardware/software/etc, basically differing in external design). Dubbed the V2.0 update, this update includes a substantially new heart rate algorithm, and more, <a href=\"https://support.polar.com/en/updates/vantage-v3-20-update\">specifically the following</a>:</p>\n<p>– Added Vertical Speed, VAM, 3D Speed<br />\n– Added Breadcrumb trails regardless if in route<br />\n– Added route arrows to indicate direction<br />\n– Added ability to access maps outside training<br />\n– Added new watch faces (both analog and digital)<br />\n– Increased map render speed, and route sync speed<br />\n– Increased optical HR accuracy</p>\n<p>Note that this is in addition to Strava Routes support, which rolled out a few weeks ago. This update, technically version 2.0.19, is available to both Polar Vantage V3 owners as of today, as well as Polar Grit X2 Pro owners.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, the Grit X2 Pro starts shipping today, after a short delay from Polar. When you get your new watch, it’ll prompt you to update to software version 2.0.19, matching the Vantage V3 above. It is this version that I’ll be basing my final review on, specifically the heart rate algorithm pieces (I’ve been testing it for the past month, but it’s only this new V2.0.19 that includes some critical HR algorithm changes). Here, a photo <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/04/hiking-madeira-variant.html\">last week on the trail in the jungle and rain</a>:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Polar-GritX2-Pro.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/04/Polar-GritX2-Pro.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Look for my final in-depth review next week sometime.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Garmin Fenix 7/Epix Series Beta Firmware:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"GarminEpixUpdateBeta.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/04/GarminEpixUpdateBeta.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Last week Garmin started the most recent quarterly update beta cycle again, though, this one is probably the tamest one we’ve seen to date in terms of new features. Most of these quarterly updates have had 20-50 new features each time, whereas one is “just” half a dozen or so (meaning, it’s more like all their competitors). That said, sometimes Garmin saves new features for later, occasionally tied to other product releases. Note that this is available for *all* Fenix 7/Epix watch variants (Pro/Not-Pro/etc…).</p>\n<p>Officially, the ‘<a href=\"https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/fenix-7-series/f/announcements/366235/beta-version-17-12---check-for-updates-only\">added features’ list is as follows</a> (plus a boatload of other fixes/tweaks/etc…):</p>\n<p>– Added ability to find a lost phone during an activity with GPS.<br />\n– Added Applied Ballistics Wind Mode (Tactix only).<br />\n– Added Indoor Walk activity.<br />\n– Added Messenger App.<br />\n– Added Recovery Advisor as an option in Morning Report and glances.<br />\n– Added self-evaluation to more activity types</p>\n<p>As a reminder, ECG is disabled during the early betas, but is re-enabled later. Also, as usual, Garmin launches the beta cycle at slightly different times for different watches (e.g. Forerunner 965), and often with slightly different features. Also, in case you’re wondering, the ‘Messenger’ app above is simply the Garmin inReach <a href=\"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/893837\">connectivity messaging app</a>.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"05a98852152b8c370719801b434322b9e171863cd91d4633f325edca20c144db","category":"Cycling"}
