{"title":"Apple takes direct aim at Google with surprising launch of Apple Maps on the web","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2408087/apple-maps-on-the-web-beta-launch-directions-look-around.html","date":1721850736000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Maps might have had an inauspicious start, but over the years it’s gotten a whole lot better. Today, Apple Maps is as good or better than Google Maps, with stunning visuals, incredibly detailed topography, and rock-solid turn-by-turn directions and traffic updates. The only problem (other than a secret Duck Duck Go integration) is it only works on Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the secret’s out. Apple on Wednesday launched <a href=\"https://beta.maps.apple.com/?ll=41.7894313164184%2C-72.73929750679473&amp;spn=0.04943626236783416%2C0.05264422367622501\">Apple Maps on the web</a> in beta, allowing anyone to use the service in a browser. Now, you won’t need an Apple device to use Apple Maps, and many features are already available, including driving and walking directions; point-of-interest information including photos, hours, ratings, and reviews; ordering food directly from the Maps place card; and curated Guides to discover places to eat, shop, and explore in cities around the world. Additionally, Apple says the Look Around feature, which lets you explore 360-degree panoramic views of some places, will be available in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Maps on the web joins Apple Music and Apple TV on the web, but those are for subscribers. Apple Maps will presumably remain a free service available as an alternative to Google Maps. It is currently available in English with Safari and Chrome on Mac and iPad, as well as Chrome and Edge on Windows PCs. Support for additional languages, browsers, and platforms will be expanded over time, Apple notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no timetable for the service to come out of beta.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d6d6183b005019d2faa335a3896facbd34d787b4e0a9063bb89138fac9270741","category":"Apple"}
