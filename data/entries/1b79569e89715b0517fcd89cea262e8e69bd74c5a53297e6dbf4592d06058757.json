Martin shifted his focus, and when Apple unveiled its own silicon with the M1 series, Martin writes, \"I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project.\" This time, there was no jailbreaking and a relatively open, if tricky, platform.</p>\n<p>Support and donations came quickly. The first two years saw rapid advancement of a platform built \"from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation.\" Upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, across \"practically every Linux subsystem,\" was an \"<em>incredibly</em> frustrating experience\" (emphasis Martin's).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/asahi-linux-lead-resigns-from-mac-based-distro-after-tumultuous-kernel-debate/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/asahi-linux-lead-resigns-from-mac-based-distro-after-tumultuous-kernel-debate/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b79569e89715b0517fcd89cea262e8e69bd74c5a53297e6dbf4592d06058757","category":"Tech"}
