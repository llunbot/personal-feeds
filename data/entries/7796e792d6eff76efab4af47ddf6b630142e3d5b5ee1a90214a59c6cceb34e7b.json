The event was focused on the European market, where battery EV penetration is relatively high, and I wouldn't expect either the Urban Cruiser or C-HR+ crossovers to show up on sale in the US. But we'll likely find the upgrades to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/the-2023-toyota-bz4x-review-not-as-bad-as-the-horror-stories-have-it/\">Toyota bZ4x</a> and the closely related <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/lexus-2023-rz-450e-disappoints-offering-poor-ev-range-and-a-bumpy-ride/\">Lexus RZ</a>, or at least some of them, in North American models at some point.</p>\n<p>The revised bZ4x will come in three powertrain options, at least in the EU, all with new battery packs. There's a 165 hp (123 kW) front-wheel drive version coupled to a smaller-capacity 57.7 kWh battery pack (which I would not expect to come to the US), and then 221 hp (165 kW) FWD and 337 (252 kW) all-wheel drive options, both of which use a new 73.1 kWh battery pack.</p>\n<p>For comparison, the bZ4xs that went on sale in the US several years ago are offered with either a 71.4 kWh pack for FWD or a 72.8 kWh pack for AWD versions.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/toyota-and-lexus-tweak-their-evs-for-eu-and-likely-the-us/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/toyota-and-lexus-tweak-their-evs-for-eu-and-likely-the-us/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
