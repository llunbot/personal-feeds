A lot of it is coming \"later this fall\" in the 15.1 update, which Apple has been testing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/you-can-now-try-apple-intelligence-in-the-ios-macos-developer-beta/\">entirely separately</a> from the 15.0 betas for weeks now. Some of it won't be ready until after <em>that</em>—rumors say image generation won't be ready until the end of the year—but in any case, none of it is ready for public consumption yet.</p>\n\n<p>But the AI-free 15.0 release does give us a chance to evaluate all of the non-AI additions to macOS this year. Apple Intelligence is sucking up a lot of the media oxygen, but in most other ways, this is a typical 2020s-era macOS release, with one or two headliners, several quality-of-life tweaks, and some sparsely documented under-the-hood stuff that will subtly change how you experience the operating system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048298#p3\">Read 214 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048298&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f4c03479a477e48a30b0587bc3602696ef605dd784613615b5ca01a4cfa40f9","category":"Tech"}
