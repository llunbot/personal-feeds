The changes were so drastic and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/reddit-calls-for-a-few-new-mods-after-axing-polarizing-some-of-its-best/\">polarizing</a> that they led to an epic <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/google-admits-reddit-protests-make-it-harder-to-find-helpful-search-results/\">protest</a> from Reddit users and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/are-reddits-replacement-mods-fit-to-fight-misinformation/\">moderators</a> that saw <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/api-pricing-protests-caused-reddit-to-crash-for-3-hours/\">thousands</a> of subreddits going private and engaging in other <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddit-mods-allowed-porn-as-protest-the-company-nuked-their-mod-badges/\">forms of inconvenience</a> for weeks. Things got ugly, but Reddit still ushered in the changes, resulting in mounds of third-party <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddit-api-changes-are-imminent-heres-whats-happening-to-your-favorite-apps/\">Reddit apps announcing their permanent closure</a>.</p>\n<p>It's been about seven months since the changes, so I wanted to see what Reddit's third-party app ecosystem looks like now. Are surviving third-party Reddit apps that started charging users making money? Are developers confident they'll be able to keep their apps open for the long term?</p>\n<p>And some apps are still available despite not charging a subscription fee. How is that possible?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992717#p3\">Read 101 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992717&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dd73ce7f2a5de49086b70e76f716ea6f5ba478a410d607ac3998a962c5fa2f02","category":"Tech"}
