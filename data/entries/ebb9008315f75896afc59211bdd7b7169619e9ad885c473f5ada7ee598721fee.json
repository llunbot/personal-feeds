For others, it's provided a good excuse to catch up on a well-regarded game that they haven't gotten around to playing in the nearly two decades since its release.</p>\n<p>I'm in that second group. While I've played a fair amount of <em>Skyrim</em> (on platforms ranging from the Xbox 360 to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/the-world-of-skyrim-is-thrilling-and-flawed-in-vr/\">VR headsets</a>) and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-impressions-putting-the-vast-back-in-vast-cosmos/\"><em>Starfield</em></a>, I've never taken the time to go back to the earlier Bethesda Game Studios RPGs. As such, my impressions of <em>Oblivion</em> before this <em>Remaster</em> have been guided by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/03/oblivion/\">old critical reactions</a> and the <a href=\"https://trismegistus.tech/apps/the-cheddar-scrolls/en.html\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/this-beloved-oblivion-meme-got-remade-7-years-later-proving-oblivion-remastered-preserves-the-timeless-comedy-of-the-original\">memes</a> calling attention to the game's somewhat janky engine.</p>\n<p>Playing through the first few hours of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>Â this week, without the benefit of nostalgia, I can definitely see why <em>Oblivion</em> made such an impact on RPG fans in 2006. But I also see all the ways that the game can feel a bit dated after nearly two decades of advancements in genre design.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/is-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-fun-for-a-first-time-player-in-2025/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/is-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-fun-for-a-first-time-player-in-2025/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ebb9008315f75896afc59211bdd7b7169619e9ad885c473f5ada7ee598721fee","category":"Tech"}
