The new iMac starts at $1,299.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-iMac-M4-lifestyle-24-inch-Retina-display.jpg\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/\">As rumored</a>, Apple has upped the base memory configuration of at least one of its latest Macs. It is the first time that the company has offered the ultra-thin all-in-one desktop computer with a minimum of 16GB of memory.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of Apple's upcoming new Macs this year are likely to have at least 16GB of RAM pre-installed as standard, breaking a years-long tradition of Apple offering just 8GB of RAM in most of its base Macs and forcing customers to pay out an extra $200+ for additional memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iMac is available in a range of new colors, and the 24-inch 4.5K Retina display offers a new nano-texture glass option. The iMac also features a new 12MP Center Stage camera with Desk View, up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports, up to 32GB of Unified Memory, and color-matched accessories that include USB-C. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iMac is available to pre-order today, with availability beginning Friday, November 8. Apple is expected to announce new MacBook Pro models and a new redesigned Mac mini later this week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/new-m4-imac-minimum-16gb-ram/\">New Base M4 iMac Comes With 16GB of Unified Memory</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-base-m4-imac-comes-with-16gb-of-unified-memory.2441140/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d70a6c76ccb1f81f734d51d651d39f91fb8ae15495e9861ce7965875ebe19f29","category":"Apple"}
