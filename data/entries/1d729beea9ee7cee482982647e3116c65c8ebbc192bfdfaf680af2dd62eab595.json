The US government <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.232574/gov.uscourts.mad.232574.248.0.pdf\">said</a> that Klyushin “stands convicted of the most significant hacking and trading scheme in American history, and one of the largest insider trading schemes ever prosecuted.” As for Seleznev, federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/technology/russian-hacker-sentenced.html\">said</a> that he has “harmed more victims and caused more financial loss than perhaps any other defendant that has appeared before the court.”</p>\n<p>What sort of hacker do you have to be to attract the interest of the Russian state in prisoner swaps like these? Clearly, it helps to have hacked widely and caused major damage to Russia’s enemies. By bringing these two men home, Russian leadership is sending a clear message to domestic hackers: We’ve got your back.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040698#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040698&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d729beea9ee7cee482982647e3116c65c8ebbc192bfdfaf680af2dd62eab595","category":"Tech"}
