According to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303162120\">November paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, if someone happened to see you shaking a wrapped gift, they would <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/11/20/shaking-boxes/\">be able to tell</a> from those motions what you were trying to learn by doing so.</p>\n<p>“There are few things more delightful than seeing a child’s eyes light up as they pick up a present and wonder what might be inside,” <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1010649\">said co-author Chaz Firestone</a> of Johns Hopkins University, who studies how vision and thought interact. “What our work shows is that your mind is able to track the information they are seeking. Just as they might be able to tell what’s inside the box by shaking it around, <em>you</em> can tell what they are trying to figure out when they shake it.” Christmas presents are \"the perfect real-life example of our experiment.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992537#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992537&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c37d1d13da4b3cdd59929e1411640f8f9c9f5e8bf97b6c457a767fcbc252e0a0","category":"Tech"}
