The Austin-based studio turned heads with 2018's <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> remake before tackling its redux of FromSoftware's <em>Demon's</em> for the PS5. It has been a longtime independent collaborator with Sony, remastering critical favorites like <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/uncharted/\">Uncharted</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/\">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, and <em>Gravity Rush</em>, and it has almost exclusively worked with PlayStation-branded properties. (Other than <em>Metal Gear</em>, Bluepoint's only other third-party project was its 2014 port of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/titanfall/\"><em>Titanfall</em></a> for the Xbox 360.)</p>\n\n<h2>A long history with Sony</h2>\n<p>Rumors that Sony would be buying the developer date back to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/sony-purchases-returnal-developer-housemarque-after-successful-ps5-debut/\">company's acquisition</a> of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/returnal-review-roguelite-arcade-combat-has-never-felt-this-epic-or-hard/\"><em>Returnal</em></a> developer Housemarque in June. That's when the PlayStation Japan Twitter account accidentally tweeted out a PlayStation Studios splash image that included key art from both <em>Returnal</em> and <em>Demon's Souls</em> alongside other established Sony games. Naturally, the tweet was quickly deleted, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338\">not before the image was saved</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799744#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799744&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2850c5308f9104caab2a58cecb2c08eb9d20a2fabe04a3651a2a6d2f1eb3d5af","category":"Tech"}
