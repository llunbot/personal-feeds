You can simply call the executable <code>networkQuality</code>,\nwhich executes the following tests:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Upload/download <em>capacity</em> (your Tx/Rx bandwidth essentially)</li>\n<li>Upload/download <em>flows</em>, this seems to be the number of test\npackets used for the responsiveness tests</li>\n<li>Upload/download <em>responsiveness</em> measured in <em>Roundtrips Per\nMinute (RPM)</em>, which according to Apple, is the number of\nsequential round-trips, or transactions, a network can do in one\nminute under normal working conditions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The capacity is roughly the same metric you could expect from\ntools like <a href=\"https://fast.com/\">Fast.com</a> from Netflix, or <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/\">OOkla’s\nSpeedtest</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neato. Just type <code>networkQuality</code> in Terminal, let it run for a bit, and then hit Return to get a summary.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/24/macos-12-network-quality\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"91986ffeb7957d2346c17fb8402a14c36df068066d1fb41cc05a46ae01d0a716","category":"Tech"}
