The men will return on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a race down some of the most jaw-dropping, hand-sculpted gravity lines ever constructed may seem a bit frightening, riders and their dedicated diggers hope for fortunate days to reach a coveted podium spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diggers will have their shovels and pickaxes hard at work at the Virgin, Utah, venue during the days before Red Bull Rampage 2024. They will cultivate lines for their riders while the riders themselves are busy plotting courses and tricks sure to shock and awe anyone with the stomach to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s our guide on how to watch Red Bull Rampage, 2024 edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Does Red Bull Rampage Work?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202310100078.jpg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202310100078-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Szymon Godziek at Red Bull Rampage 2023\" /></a><figcaption>Szymon Godziek hucking a huge gap at Red Bull Rampage 2023; (photo/Christian Pondella, Red Bull Content Pool)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull Rampage is a unique mountain biking event. Riders and their crews spend days handcrafting unique lines filled with drops, gaps, and enormous, sketchy descents that drop around 1,000 feet over the entire course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After several days of work, riders have 4 days to practice and refine their lines before the final event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders get two runs during the event finals to send the cleanest and most exciting run possible. Judges score riders on a scale of 1 to 100 based on difficulty of line choice, tricks and style, fluidity and control, and air time. It’s not just about successfully making it to the bottom. Riders have to provide ample amounts of style and big sends as they do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Red Bull Rampage 2024: </strong>The Competitors</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202210220310.jpg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202210220310-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Reed Boggs at Red Bull Rampage 2023\" /></a><figcaption>Reed Boggs airs it out during Red Bull Rampage 2023; (photo/Garth Milan, Red Bull Content Pool) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Men’s Field</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the men’s side, the top eight competitors from last year’s event were automatically entered in this year’s Rampage. Ten other wildcard entries were granted based on a selection committee of former competitors, other pro athletes, judges, and cycling industry experts. This committee used competition results and video submissions to judge overall ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This group of 18 men includes four former winners and two Red Bull Rampage rookies and promises to showcase a diverse set of styles and skills at the event. Additionally, the selection committee chose five alternates.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2022/10/gj-kyle-strait-red-bull-rampage-1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2022/10/gj-kyle-strait-red-bull-rampage-1-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"kyle strait\" /></a><figcaption> Fan favorite Kyle Strait will compete in the 2024 Red Bull Rampage; (photo/screenshot/Kyle Strait)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Prequalified Athletes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cam Zink (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Van Steenbergen (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carson Storch (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brendan Fairclough (GBR)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talus Turk (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyle Strait (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emil Johansson (SWE)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bienvenido Aguado Alba (ESP)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202310100067.jpg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202310100067-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Emil Johansson from Red Bull Rampage 2023\" /></a><figcaption>Slopestyle king Emil Johansson is on the start list for the 2024 Red Bull Rampage; (photo/Christian Pondella, Red Bull Content Pool)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wildcard Athletes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Adolf Silva (ESP)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brandon Semenuk (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemens Kaudela (AUT)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kurt Sorge (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luke Whitlock (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reed Boggs (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Szymon Godziek (POL)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Genon (BEL)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Isted (GBR)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler McCaul (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Alternates</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethan Nell (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DJ Brandt (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaxson Riddle (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hayden Zablotny (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dylan Stark (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202310100070-1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202310100070-1-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Gee Atherton from Red Bull Rampage 2023\" /></a><figcaption>Long-time competitor Gee Atherton will not be at this year’s Rampage; (photo/Christian Pondella, Red Bull Content Pool)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Cam Zink scored a 95 on his final runs to snag the victory. Tom Van Stennbergen nabbed second with an 89, while Carson Storch took the final podium spot with a score of 87. Look for these three to perform well again, as well as the veteran Emil Johansson and fan favorite Kyle Strait. Notably missing this year is Gee Atherton, which may be a relief to the rest of the men’s field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Women’s Field</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eight women were invited to the <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/biking/mountain-bike/women-mountain-bikers-red-bull-rampage\">first women’s edition</a> of Red Bull Rampage, which takes place 2 days before the men’s competition. The same committee chose these top women as the men based on recent competition results, video submissions, and overall ability. Four alternates are also listed on the women’s inaugural competitor’s list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Invited Athletes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Camila Nogueira (ARG)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casey Brown (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hannah Bergemann (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Blewitt (NZL)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robin Goomes (NZL)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaea Verbeeck (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vero Sandler (UK)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vinny Armstrong (NZL)</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Alternates</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Harriet Burbidge-Smith (AUS)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chelsea Kimball (USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia Astle (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Micayla Gatto (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoever wins the 2024 Red Bull Rampage will go down in history as the first women’s winner! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Red Bull Rampage 2024 Venue</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202210190078.jpg\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2023/10/SI202210190078-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Szymon Godziek at Red Bull Rampage 2023\" /></a><figcaption>Szymon Godziek rides his bike at Red Bull Rampage 2023 in Virgin, Utah; (photo/Bartek Wolinski, Red Bull Content Pool)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The course should look pretty familiar for the riders who have competed in Rampage in the past. This year’s venue is the same one from 2023 and has previously hosted the event from 2008 through 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mountain is a short distance from Zion National Park and covers roughly 1,000 feet of elevation from start to finish. It includes huge drops of roughly 70 feet, exposed ridgelines, and a smattering of ramps for riders to traverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in 2022, though, the course looked different from the course of 2008 to 2013. Rampage rules changed in 2015 to allow only sandbags in trail construction, without any wood features common to free-ride and downhill courses. That’s part of what makes Rampage unique and even more challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Watch Red Bull Rampage 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to watch Red Bull Rampage via different streaming services and media channels:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ESPN+</strong>: The women’s broadcast will be on October 10 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT, and the men’s broadcast will be on October 12 at 12 p.m. ET/9 a.m. PT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redbull.com/us-en/channels/best-of-red-bull-stream\"><strong>Red Bull TV</strong></a>: You can watch the event live on Red Bull TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@RedBullBike\"><strong>Red Bull Bike YouTube channel</strong></a>: You can watch the event live on Red Bull Bike’s YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ESPN2</strong>: You can watch highlights on Sunday, October 27, with the women’s competition at 5 p.m. ET/2 p.m. PT and the men’s competition at 6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hulu</strong>: You can stream the event on Hulu (with ads) for $14.99 per month or Hulu (no ads) for $24.99 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Roku</strong>: You can find where to stream the event for free or at a low cost on any Roku device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/biking/mountain-bike/how-to-watch-red-bull-rampage-mountain-biking-live\">GearJunkie</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/how-to-watch-red-bull-rampage-2024/\">How to Watch Red Bull Rampage 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Mark Wilson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0ad4c20150ac379f88758044ec1f637cff028a1291bdb048e622371da3f9e089","category":"Cycling"}
