The claimed weight for a frame in an unspecified size is 900g.</p>\n<p>Unlike the design of its predecessor, the GRIX.2’s cables are fully internally routed. A similar setup is seen on the integrated cockpit used on Storck’s Aerfast 3 aerobike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The GRIX.2 has a neat integrated cockpit based on Storck’s aero road bike.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Storck has also equipped the GRIX.2 for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/bikepacking/\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a>, with a selection of bottle bosses and frame-mount options for bags.</p>\n<p>The GRIX.2’s eye-catching deep orange paint scheme is described as ‘volcanic sunset’. Storck says the shade complements the autumnal countryside while contrasting with the gloom of winter and early spring. It has not said whether different colours are available.</p>\n<p>An entry-level Storck GRIX.2 will set you back €4,199 (international pricing TBC).</p>\n<h2>What is Classified Powershift?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Classified’s Powershift gear hub is concealed in the rear wheel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Storck</i></span></div>\n<p>First introduced on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ridley-kanzo-fast/\">Ridley Kanzo Fast</a>, Classified’s Powershift is a two-speed internal gear hub system that replicated the functionality of a front derailleur.</p>\n<p>The system is controlled wirelessly and can handle loads of up to 1,000 watts.</p>\n<p>Classified Powershift offers ratios of 1:1 and 0.7:1. With an 11-34t cassette, this would provide a gear range of 451 per cent. For context, conventional 2x systems provide similar range.</p>\n<p>Classified’s Powershift system is claimed to be more reliable than a front derailleur because it is fully protected from the elements, with the whole setup housed entirely within the rear hub. It is also claimed to shift faster.</p>\n<p>In addition, Storck claims removing the front derailleur reduces <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/7-easy-ways-to-get-faster-with-aerodynamics/\" target=\"_blank\">aerodynamic drag</a>. However, the press release for the bike does not state the claimed saving offered.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ce08ddffd14b0540e64e16107e26d8b911cdf55cba2cc53e021a1e8466c051d8","category":"Cycling"}
