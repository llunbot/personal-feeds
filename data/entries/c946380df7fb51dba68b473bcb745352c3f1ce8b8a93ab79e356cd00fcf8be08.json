This will be the first cycle with three Motorola Razr flip phones, ranging from the relatively inexpensive base model Razr to the lavishly expensive Razr Ultra. All three phones have a slick foldable design, a stronger hinge, and big screensâ€”and they come in a collection of snazzy Pantone colorways.</p>\n<h2>Pretty colors, stronger hinges</h2>\n<p>The three models have similar overall designs, but the specs are notably different.

The Ultra has the same processor seen in Samsung's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsungs-galaxy-s25-event-was-an-ai-presentation-with-occasional-phone-hardware/\">latest flagship phones</a>, the Snapdragon 8 Elite.

All three phones are available in some stunning colors with various materials and finishes. The Razr comes in Spring Bud (above), Gibraltar Sea, Parfait Pink, and Lightest Sky. The Razr+ gets Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink (below). The Ultra comes in Rio Red, Scarab, Cabaret, or Mountain Trail, with a wood body that harkens back to the days of Moto maker. It's refreshing to get so much choice when most phones are only available in a couple of boring tones.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/motorola-reveals-three-new-super-colorful-razr-foldables/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/motorola-reveals-three-new-super-colorful-razr-foldables/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c946380df7fb51dba68b473bcb745352c3f1ce8b8a93ab79e356cd00fcf8be08","category":"Tech"}
