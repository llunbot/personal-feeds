But is that really true? And are you willing to bet your costly and beautiful new phone on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s true that iPhones have got more robust over the years, with features such as Ceramic Shield helping to make them less prone to drop damage than in the past. The problem is that (assuming you’re not prepared to spend all day sitting on the sofa or lying on a deep-pile rug) you can’t control what you drop your iPhone on to, the distance it falls, or the angle at which it lands. Even the toughest iPhone can still get unlucky with a corner of jagged rock, leaving you on the hook for a ruinously expensive screen repair. Unless you’ve got money to throw away–far more money than it would take to buy a case, by the way–it simply doesn’t make sense to go caseless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, phone cases don’t merely protect against the occasional worst-case scenario; they can also bring additional features that are useful all the time. It’s not just the stick, in other words. It’s also the carrot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find a case with a kickstand, for example, and your phone is transformed into a versatile jack of all trades. It will be capable of serving as an alarm clock while charging (particularly with the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1972460/ios-17-standby-clock-widgets-photos-customize.html\">StandBy mode</a>), a high-quality movie player or, when paired with a wireless controller, a portable games console. Better still, if you can find a rotatable ring stand like the one on TORRAS’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/0EFE7B8B-6070-4CAB-86F7-6C10FA0630C1?maas=maas_adg_E1248DD0C41839DF38D0BF53D8771775_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;ingress=0&amp;visitId=fe5f79b7-93a1-446f-af6c-b2556a9c1e24&amp;=aa_maas&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">UPRO Ostand R</a> then the possibilities are almost endless, enabling you to set up your phone at any angle or orientation that suits you when scrolling through social media, catching up with friends on FaceTime, watching TV or playing games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good case, then, serves as both functional upgrade and rugged protection, leaving only one question: why would an iPhone owner <em>not</em> buy one?</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"TORRAS UPRO Ostand R\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?resize=1200%2C676&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?resize=1536%2C865&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?resize=2048%2C1153&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-3.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" /></figure><p>TORRAS</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to find the right case</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have we convinced you? Well, the next decision is even more important: choosing the right case. Here are the criteria to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Protection. This is the key consideration. Does your case offer certified drop protection? If so, to which standard (look for military grade) and to what height? How much protection does it offer to the corners of the phone, and to its screen? Are you satisfied this case can protect your phone?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Design. Balance the protection you should expect against your experience with the phone. Does the protection come at the cost of usability? Does the phone look good in the case? Can it still charge easily? Is it still compatible with Apple’s MagSafe technology?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Features. We’ve already mentioned kickstands… although there are kickstands, and there are kickstands. Assuming your case offers a stand, how easy it to adjust? Can it provide multiple viewing angles? Does it work in both portrait and landscape orientation? And is it built to last?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price. Lastly, does the case fit your budget?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"TORRAS UPRO Ostand R\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C676&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C865&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1153&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TORRAS-2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" /></figure><p>TORRAS</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meet the UPRO Ostand R</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at an example. TORRAS is a leading electronics brand that offers a wide range of phone cases among its extensive product portfolio. And one of its iPhone cases suits all the criteria mentioned above. We think the company’s UPRO Ostand R is well worth your consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For protection, it’s hard to beat… literally. Thanks to the Ostand R’s 10-foot drop protection to a standard that goes beyond military grade, and its innovative ShockMat™ air cushioning, your iPhone is in safe hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about features? The Ostand R, as the name suggests, is built around a superb and versatile kickstand. This has been conceived as an elegant built-in ring constructed of durable aluminum alloy (put through more than 10,000 open/close tests during the design and manufacture process), which can be rotated through 360 degrees to ensure an unsurpassable range of viewing angles in both landscape and portrait orientations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Ostand R, your iPhone becomes a nightstand alarm clock; a convenient device for watching TV and movies; a games console; a hub for social media and video calls; and so much more. The ring can even serve as a non-slip grip when holding the iPhone in your hand, and slots discreetly into the case when not in use, adding almost no bulk. The first of its kind, this is an all-in-one stand case with functionality to die for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For design, the case’s smart look means you’re not missing out on the iPhone’s own aesthetic, and this includes neat cutouts that ensure full functionality for your cameras and ports. It’s compatible with MagSafe, too, so you can happily connect your iPhone to a wireless charging pad, or attach a MagSafe wallet, without having to take it out of the case. In fact, the Ostand R supplies its own highly powerful 18N Halbach magnets to ensure a strong connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TORRAS’s Ostand range covers all of Apple’s current iPhones. The cases are available from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/0EFE7B8B-6070-4CAB-86F7-6C10FA0630C1?maas=maas_adg_E1248DD0C41839DF38D0BF53D8771775_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;ingress=0&amp;visitId=fe5f79b7-93a1-446f-af6c-b2556a9c1e24&amp;=aa_maas&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, starting at just $31.99 during Black Friday.
