Just this month, Plugable released the aforementioned Thunderbolt 4 Docking Station as its latest dock product, and it has all of the latest technologies that you want for your Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://plugable.com/products/tbt4-udx1\">Available for $289.95</a>, the Thunderbolt 4 Docking Station is equipped with a total of 11 ports, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, 4 10Gb/s USB-A ports (one of which can be used for charging accessories), an SD card slot, audio in/out, an HDMI 2.0 port, and a 2.5GB/s Ethernet port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/plugable-docking-station-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThere's also a Thunderbolt 4 host port that provides 96W charging, which is enough power even for Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro. Dual 4K 60Hz displays are supported, or a single 8K 30Hz display (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>/<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Pro/Max chips). The Thunderbolt ports can be used to charge accessories like iPhones and iPads at 15W with power distribution, so if you have two devices charging at 15W, your Mac will get 66W.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/plugable-docking-station-3.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nIf you just need a few extra ports at an affordable price, the $33 <a href=\"https://plugable.com/products/ams-5in1e\">USB-C 5-in-1 Hub Designed for MagSafe</a> delivers. You'll need two USB-C ports to plug in this accessory, but it a cutout for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> port lets you continue to charge with the ‌MagSafe‌ port on Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ MacBook Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/plugable-hub-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe 5-in-1 Hub adds two 5Gb/s USB-A ports, a 40Gb/s USB-C port with up to 100W pass-through charging, a combination audio port, and a Gigabit Ethernet port. Up to a 6K 60Hz display is supported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/plugable-hub-2.jpg\" alt width=\"3013\" height=\"1695\" />\r<br />\nFor charging Apple devices like the MacBook Pro, Plugable has the <a href=\"https://plugable.com/products/ps-epr-140c1\">$50 140W USB-C GaN Power Adapter</a>, which has the right output to fast charge all Apple devices up to the 16-inch MacBook Pro (note that you'll need Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ Cable for the 16-inch model). Because it's using GaN technology and a flip-out plug, this is a compact charger that's ideal for travel, and it's smaller than the power adapter that comes with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/plugable-power-adapter.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nWe have one amazing Plugable prize pack to give away to a <em>MacRumors</em> reader. It includes a 14-inch ‌M2‌ MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage, the Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Docking Station, the 5-in-1 USB-C Hub, and the 140W USB-C GaN Power Adapter.
