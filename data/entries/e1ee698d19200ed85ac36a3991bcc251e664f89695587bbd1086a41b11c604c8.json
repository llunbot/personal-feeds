Between the rework of the landscape of Hyrule, the array of new floating islands, and the major, gameplay-altering new powers Link will get, it's looking less like a retread every day.</p>\n<p>That has a lot of us very excited about the new game. If you're right there with us, this is a good place to start to prepare for the launch. You can buy the game, of course (no discounts just yet), but there are a bunch of limited-time deals on accessories for your Switch that you might get some use out of when you're exploring the skies.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935591#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935591&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chuong Nguyen","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e1ee698d19200ed85ac36a3991bcc251e664f89695587bbd1086a41b11c604c8","category":"Tech"}
