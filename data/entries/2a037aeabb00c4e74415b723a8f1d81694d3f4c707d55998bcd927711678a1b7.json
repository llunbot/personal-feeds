But the app's performance is severely hampered by Apple's restrictions on so-called \"just-in-time\" (JIT) compilation, limiting the app's suitability for effectively emulating many PC games.</p>\n<p>Built on <a href=\"https://www.qemu.org/\">the generic command-line emulation layer QEMU</a>, the <a href=\"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM\">open-source UTM</a> boasts support for \"30+ processors,\" from x86 and PowerPC to RISC-V and ARM64. The App Store listing promises you can \"run classic software and old-school games\" through both a VGA graphics mode and text-based terminal.</p>\n<p>Don't expect a seamless, RetroArch-style path to playing <em>Space Cadet Pinball</em> on your iPhone, though. The UTM developers <a href=\"https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/\">link to pre-configured settings downloads</a> for versions of Windows going back to XP, alongside guides for getting those OSes up and running on iOS. But users will need to bring their own legitimate Windows installation ISO and go through the cumbersome process of installing the OS as well as <a href=\"https://www.spice-space.org/\">a version of SPICE tools</a> to help coordinate access through iOS (downloading pre-built, UTM-compatible Linux builds seems more straightforward).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037072#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037072&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2a037aeabb00c4e74415b723a8f1d81694d3f4c707d55998bcd927711678a1b7","category":"Tech"}
