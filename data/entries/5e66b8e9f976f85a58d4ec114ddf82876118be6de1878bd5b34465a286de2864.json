{"title":"Epic Games Setting Up Webshops for iOS Developers to Offer Users Out-of-App Purchases","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/epic-games-webshops-ios-developers/","date":1746116947000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a> <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update\">today announced plans</a> for ‌Epic Games‌ Store Webshops, a feature that will allow developers to launch digital storefronts that are hosted by the ‌Epic Games‌ Store. With Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/\">mandated App Store rule changes</a> in the United States, developers will soon be able to direct customers to web shops to make out-of-app purchases, bypassing the in-app purchase flow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/epic-games-store.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌Epic Games‌ Store will charge developers a 0 percent fee for the first $1,000,000 in revenue they collect per app per year, and after that, developers will need to pay Epic a 12 percent cut. The fees are applicable to all payments that are processed by the ‌Epic Games‌ Store. ‌Epic Games‌ also says that players that spend in Epic Webshops will be able to accrue 5 percent Epic Rewards on all purchases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMany smaller games do not exceed $1 million in revenue per year, so the ‌Epic Games‌ Store Webshop could be a viable option for small and independent developers. Developers that earn more will likely want to set up their own payment options using online payment platforms like Stripe or Shopify for even lower fees.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic's announcement follows a ruling yesterday that will see Apple forced to make major updates to its U.S. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> policies as part of an ongoing ‌App Store‌ dispute with ‌Epic Games‌. Apple cannot prevent developers from directing customers to better deals outside of the ‌App Store‌, nor can the company collect fees for these purchases, among other changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple was ordered to comply with the order immediately, and the court said that it \"will not tolerate further delays.\" Apple said that it plans to implement the changes as ordered, though <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-rule-change-appeal/\">it will appeal the decision</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/epic-games-webshops-ios-developers/\">Epic Games Setting Up Webshops for iOS Developers to Offer Users Out-of-App Purchases</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-setting-up-webshops-for-ios-developers-to-offer-users-out-of-app-purchases.2456319/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5e66b8e9f976f85a58d4ec114ddf82876118be6de1878bd5b34465a286de2864","category":"Apple"}
