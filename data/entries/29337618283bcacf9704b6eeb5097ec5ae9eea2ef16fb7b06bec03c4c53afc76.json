They've been up for preorder for less than 24 hours, and if you order one now, you probably won't get it before November or December.</p>\n<p>But the new laptops aren't Apple's only in-demand product: The shipping times for <a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/zab6q7\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's $19 microfiber Polishing Cloth</a> have also already slipped back into mid to late November. Unfortunately, this means that your compatible iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and iPods will need to remain unpolished for at least a month. It's unclear whether the delays are being caused by low supply, overwhelming demand, or some combination of both.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MM6F3_AV2.jpeg\" /><p>The Polishing Cloth, folded over in a visually appealing manner. Without testing, we can't say whether the Apple logo is cosmetic or if it meaningfully improves the polishing experience. (credit: Apple)</p></div>\n<p>The Polishing Cloth boasts support for an impressive range of Apple products, which Apple lists out in detail on the Cloth's product page. The list includes iPhones as old as 2014's iPhone 6, every generation of Apple Watch, and even the old iPod nano and iPod shuffle. Without testing, however, we can't confirm whether the Polishing Cloth will adequately polish older unsupported devices or non-Apple gadgets like Android phones or the Nintendo Switch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805793#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805793&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"29337618283bcacf9704b6eeb5097ec5ae9eea2ef16fb7b06bec03c4c53afc76","category":"Tech"}
