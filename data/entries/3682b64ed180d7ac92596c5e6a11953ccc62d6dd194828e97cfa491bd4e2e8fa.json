From casual bikepacking weekends to multi-day adventures and race setups, there is something out there for all bikepackers’ needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note is that more careful packing is required to prevent the bags from moving about too much and, as with touring, ensuring even weight distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most popular style of bags available include a seatpack – attached via the seatpost and saddle where the bulk of kit is usually carried, a frame bag – which maximises the internal space – and a front bag, which can either be directly mounted to the handlebars or via a harness mount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve rounded up eight brands that make great bags to put you in good stead to set off on an epic adventure… </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-tips\">Tunisia Diaries: 7 things I wish I had known before I set off on my bikepacking adventure</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\">Buyer’s guide: The best gravel bike tyres</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/bikepacking-guide-how-to-pack-your-bike-and-yourself\">Bikepacking guide: How to pack your bike, and yourself</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\">An introduction to bikepacking</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>8 of the best bikepacking bag brands</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Ortlieb</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/02151655/ortlieb_bikepacking-970x686.jpg\" alt=\"ortlieb_bikepacking\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a manufacturer of some of the best panniers, it’s unsurprising German brand Ortlieb also makes some of the smartest, toughest and easiest-to-use bikepacking bags too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its range features a whole host of models, including clever fork-mounted options and an easy access roll-top front accessory pouch, all of which are 100% waterproof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re going to stick to the holy trinity here, being the brand’s 16.5-litre Seat-Pack (456g), 15-litre Handlebar-Pack (420g) and top tube-version Frame-Pack (170g) bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155751/ortlieb_handlebarpack_bikepacking-970x686.jpg\" alt=\"ortlieb_handlebarpack_bikepacking\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The material is not only waterproof but also robust enough to give the bags a degree of structure that helps keep everything neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixings are also simultaneously easy to detach and secure. This is evident across the range, but particularly noticeable on the Handlebar-Pack which is supported away from the handlebar and kept out of the way of any cables by a series of adjustable foam blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155755/ortlieb_seatpack_bikepacking-970x686.jpg\" alt=\"ortlieb_seatpack_bikepacking\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The seat pack is similarly staunch in its attachment to the seatpost, fixing as it does with two huge rubberised seatpost straps plus the normal saddle-rail compression ties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boasting a huge capacity, it is kept compact and stable by a clever air-value system which is also found on the bar bag. Essentially, you stuff the bag, then roll down the end while letting the air inside escape. The result is a firm hold, improved storage efficiency and a minimum of rattling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both front and back options benefit from extra webbing and attachment points, plus reflective detailing. Pretty much watertight thanks to the roll-top closure, the Frame-Pack includes an almost-as-resilient zip, the chunky tab of which is easy to pull even when wearing gloves.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/bike-bags-and-panniers\" target=\"_blank\">full Ortlieb range at Tredz </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Ortlieb Seat Pack from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Ortlieb-Seat-Pack-Saddle-Bag_232438.htm?sku=765490&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Accessories%20%3E%20Bags%20%3E%20Saddle%20bags&amp;utm_content=Ortlieb&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS39mObmhr8XEpUvlldVdrDoS-SlRNUvIWphhKjEKXYNlCVz5MZKl64aAkGXEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (from £105)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Ortlieb Handlebar Pack from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Ortlieb-Handlebar-Pack-Bag_232436.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (from £95)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Ortlieb Frame Pack Toptube from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Ortlieb-Frame-Pack-Toptube_232439.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (from £95)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Apidura</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155822/apidura_expedition_bags-970x589.jpg\" alt=\"apidura_expedition_bags\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apidura is a popular bikepacking brand, offering a wide range of frame, handlebar and rear seatpacks available in various sizes. The brand has four ranges: Expedition, Racing, Backcountry and City, plus various collaborations. Essentially all areas of two-wheeled adventure are covered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Expedition range is made from a lightweight three-layer laminate fabric that is waterproof and resistant to tears and abrasions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is the saddle pack, which comes in either 9, 14 or 17 litres. It attaches with Velcro straps, has Woojin buckles as straps to secure the roll top and a lightweight moulded section of HDPE thermoplastic sits in the saddle bag’s lower section to reinforce its structure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is standard, the seat pack has light mounting points and additional bungee straps on the top for carrying something extra if needed. The straps are seriously secure, and stand up to even the roughest gravel when packed full. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155824/apidura_bike_packing_bags.jpeg\" alt=\"apidura_bike_packing_bags\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The handlebar pack comes in 9 or 14 litres and is a dual roll-top system. Unlike others in this guide it mounts directly onto the bike rather than having its own cage or mount. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> The frame pack has a full-length zip for easy access and a neat cable port, which could be useful for storing a battery to recharge devices or running a hydration bladder hose through. It’s available in a wide range of sizes, both compact and tall, and there is also the option for a full frame bag too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stable, easy to use and available in a great range of sizes, Apidura bikepacking bags are an excellent choice. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.condorcycles.com/collections/apidura\" target=\"_blank\">full Apidura range at Condor Cycles </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Apidura Expedition Saddle pack from <a href=\"https://www.condorcycles.com/collections/apidura/products/apidura-saddle-pack-dry?variant=37796602740886\" target=\"_blank\">Condor (from £125)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Apidura Expedition handlebar pack from <a href=\"http://condorcycles.com/collections/apidura/products/apidura-handlebar-pack-dry?variant=37796603887766\" target=\"_blank\">Condor (from £100)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Apidura Expedition frame pack from <a href=\"https://www.condorcycles.com/collections/apidura/products/apidura-expedition-frame-pack?variant=37796356948118\" target=\"_blank\">Condor (from £93)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

It also puts a premium on local sourcing and avoidance of waste, and offers a lifetime warranty on its bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restrap offers a wide range of bar bags, from the 1.5-litre Canister Bag right up to the 14-litre Bar Bag. The latter uses a dry bag which is mounted in a holster for easy mounting and dismounting. On top of the main compartment capacity, you can add a food pouch that will hold 3 litres and there are elastic drawcord straps for yet more gear. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/restrap2-970x634.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/restrap2-970x634.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/restrap2-300x196.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/restrap2-768x502.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/restrap2-750x490.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/restrap2-1140x745.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/restrap2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Restrap</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping a large bar bag in place and away from your steering and front wheel can be a problem, but Restrap sells the steel Bumper Bar, which pushes the bag upwards and away from the wheel. It fits on a standard 1 1/8-inch headset and can also be used as an additional mounting point for lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For mid-bike carrying, Restrap has both top tube and frame fit bag options. Its top tube bags are designed for different frame sizes and offer capacity between 2.5 and 4.5 litres. The top tube mounting straps are rubberised to help avoid scuffing the frame and add extra grip. Inside, there are mesh pockets and there’s even a cable slot for dynamo lighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/restrap_saddle_bag.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Heading to the rear, Restrap’s Saddle Bags are made from textured nylon and come in sizes from 7 up to 18 litres. Like the bar bag, the design uses a holster to hold a dry bag in place, so that this can be easily removed. There’s a patented magnetic buckle to adjust the holster and other features include reflective military-grade paracord fastening.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Emma-tunisia-diaries-10.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Features Writer Emma Cole used a Restrap setup for her trip from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/london-to-tunisia-cycling-route\" target=\"_blank\">London to Tunisia</a>.

Blackburn Outpost</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155758/blackburn_bikepacking-970x847.jpg\" alt=\"blackburn_bikepacking\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackburn’s large-capacity Outpost Handlebar Roll and Dry Bag does things a little differently. Slightly heavier than other alternatives, it uses a rigid quick release fixing to hold its sizeable carry 11.5-litre capacity proud of the handlebars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further secured by straps that then wrap back around the handlebar, it means you can load it with up to 3.5kg and rattle down mountain bike-style trails without it shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it won’t foul your frame or cabling either. The weight cost for this awesome feature-set? A slightly increased load of 500g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155803/blackburn_outpost_bag-970x853.jpg\" alt=\"blackburn_outpost_bag\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick to remove, the drybag that sits in the holster can be rolled down small for dainty loads or use with a drop-handlebar, or left wide for hauling bigger loads when used with a flat bar. Either way, it’s unlikely to rattle out thanks to a velcro backing that tacks in securely within the holster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swallowing up to 11 litres, the sizeable Blackburn Outpost Seat Pack is a little more secure. Again comprising a holster and removable drybag, this combo makes packing and end-of-the-day access easy. Although, getting at your equipment during the ride is a little more of a faff.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/02151719/blackburn_outpost_saddlebag.jpg\" alt=\"blackburn_outpost_saddlebag\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With multiple compression straps, the whole assemblage can be squished down into a secure and compact package, while multiple lasing points on the back mean you can use its shell-style for carrying additional bulky yet lightweight items. Just be careful to avoid the temptation to over-stuff it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Blackburn doesn’t recommend it for use with carbon seatposts, that’s why electrical tape was invented, right? We’re not promising any warranty if it buggers up your bike, but that trust tape can probably mitigate any wear issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/c/accessories/bike-accessories/bike-bags?index=n&amp;brandName=Blackburn\" target=\"_blank\">full Blackburn range at Chain Reaction Cycles</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Blackburn Outpost Seat Pack from <a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/uk/blackburn-outpost-seat-pack-with-dry-bag-camblboutsp6/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeks (£70)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Blackburn Outpost Handlebar Roll from <a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/uk/blackburn-outpost-handlebar-roll-with-dry-bag-camblbouthr6/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeks (£75)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Evoc</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155807/evoc_bikepacking_bags-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"evoc_bikepacking_bags\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Evoc makes a range of simply designed, fuss-free compact bikepacking bags which are best suited to those happy to travel light rather than carry the kitchen sink. On the plus side, a combination of this reduced volume and high-end Boa dial fittings mean they’re both swift to fit and highly secure once in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often found on items like shoes, the ratcheting Boa straps go a long way to eliminating the swaying that can affect many bags while offering a slim alternative to Velcro or other closure types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the rear seatpack, this is backed up by a soft rubber jaw that not only clamps onto the seatpost but simultaneously protects it from wear. Its unique shape is also happy to wrap around both dropper and aero-type seatposts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a roll-type closure, the seatpack Boa WP 8 is available in four different sizes: with 6 or 8 litres of packing volume for day trips and micro-adventures and with 12 or 16 litres for multi-day tours and expeditions. It is waterproof so will protect any items inside. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155812/evoc_bikepacking_bags_alt-970x512.jpeg\" alt=\"evoc_bikepacking_bags_alt\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to the front of the bike, Evoc’s Handlebar Pack uses similar fabrics and again employs a Boa dial for rock-solid fitting. Featuring rigid yet tacky support on the back of the pack, this ensures it stays where you put it regardless of the terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it also leaves a modicum of space for any cables. It’s available in two sizes to hold either two and a half or five litres of equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps slightly less radical but quality nevertheless, the set is rounded off by the 3.5-litre Frame Pack, which is also available in a smaller size of 1.5 litres. Using more conventional Velcro straps to attach itself, thoughtfully it also arrives with frame protection stickers to stop these scuffing your paintwork. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/brand/evoc/?p=2\" target=\"_blank\">full Evoc range at Tweeks </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Evoc Seatpack Boa WP 8 from <a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/evoc-boa-seat-pack-2009296/?sku=CAMEV723103&amp;istCompanyId=56f52ebf-49f3-492a-9cbb-cb6ab0fc1bf0&amp;istFeedId=33b89177-5114-4491-9c2a-09a3a7cb23b2&amp;istItemId=iwaawpwrx&amp;istBid=t&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS0MyIk1Lxcifm33lrK2awexaWj5v7qwEB-OLhITQONqvmg2Hur9TvIaAmaFEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeks (£75)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Evoc Handlebar Pack Boa from <a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/evoc-handlebar-pack-boa-2009286/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeks (£75.61)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Evoc Frame Pack from <a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/evoc-frame-pack-wp-4000999/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeks (£71.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Miss Grape</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155815/miss_grape_tendril_4.10_wp_bikepacking_bag-970x925.jpg\" alt=\"miss_grape_tendril_4.10_wp_bikepacking_bag\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Italian brand Miss Grape has been making bags since well before bikepacking was cool. All backed by a lifetime warranty, most are probably still going too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering two different ranges, road and adventure, Miss Grape bags are constructed from tough Nylon fabric with a water-repellent polyurethane resin coating, which makes them feel extremely robust. This stiffness goes so far as to help them keep their shape, ensuring they’re disinclined to sag or sway about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back, this facet is backed by tough straps, while on the front, a clever combination of quick-release metal buckles, foam blocks, and lockable compression adjustment keep everything rock solid. Given how regularly you’ll want to do so, it’s especially welcome to find the front bag is extremely easy to fit and remove.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155819/miss_grape_cluster_bikepacking_bag-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"miss_grape_cluster_bikepacking_bag\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The handlebar pack is called Tendril and can be mounted with both Drop Bar and MTB handlebars. It comes in either 10- or 17-litre capacity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The saddle bag, called Cluster, comes in 7, 13 or 18.6 litres, the latter being the biggest offering in this guide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame bag is known as the Internode, is now waterproof and comes in 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 litres. That is a lot of sizes on offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miss Grape bags offer excellent design, full spares provision plus a repair service, and thus are a worthwhile investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out the<a href=\"https://www.tradeinn.com/bikeinn/en/bags-bike-bags/4082/s?_gl=1*1an9h7y*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS3UDoI5NhNPHqsuWjZf9VPL7tz6q2_29y1T19hIHkEE62xW9zglnAsaAuEaEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#fq=id_familia=4018&amp;sort=v30_sum;desc@tm4;asc&amp;fe=&amp;pf=id_subfamilia=4082@marca=9677&amp;start=0\" target=\"_blank\"> full Miss Grape range from BikeInn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Miss Grape Tendril handlebar pack from <a href=\"https://www.tradeinn.com/bikeinn/en/miss-grape-tendril-4.10-road-wp-handlebar-bag/139103409/p?_gl=1*jxxhsg*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS3UDoI5NhNPHqsuWjZf9VPL7tz6q2_29y1T19hIHkEE62xW9zglnAsaAuEaEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\">BikeInn (£93.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Miss Grape Cluster saddle bag from <a href=\"https://www.tradeinn.com/bikeinn/en/miss-grape-cluster-7-road-wp-saddle-bag/139103396/p?_gl=1*1an9h7y*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS3UDoI5NhNPHqsuWjZf9VPL7tz6q2_29y1T19hIHkEE62xW9zglnAsaAuEaEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\">BikeInn (£107.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Internode frame bag from <a href=\"https://www.tradeinn.com/bikeinn/en/miss-grape-internode-6-adventure-wp-frame-bag/139103402/p?_gl=1*jxxhsg*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS3UDoI5NhNPHqsuWjZf9VPL7tz6q2_29y1T19hIHkEE62xW9zglnAsaAuEaEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\">BikeInn (£87.49)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Wildcat Gear</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155825/bikepacking_gear_buyers_guide-970x586.jpg\" alt=\"bikepacking_gear_buyers_guide\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wildcat is a small British company that makes bikepacking bags, camping gear and other outdoor accessories. As the name suggests, each product is named after a wild cat, which is quite fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking a similar mounting approach to Restrap, the Wildcat Tiger Saddle bag uses a harness and dry bag system. The harness is made from a padded LS21 and ballistic nylon fabric construction which protects the dry bag. There are two sizes available – 7 litre or 10 litre. The drybag and harness are available to purchase separately. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to the middle of the bike, the Ocelot frame bag uses wide, strong Velcro straps and with two compartments, makes it easier to organise your kit. It comes in sizes small to extra large (from 3 to 6.5 litres). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up front, the Lion handlebar bag setup includes a double-ended drybag, which is cleverly divided to separate gear, and the same durable holster material as the saddle pack. The holster is optimised for 8- to 13-litre dry bags, so plenty for a multi-day adventure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both front and back drybags are made from good quality waterproof fabric with taped seams. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02155828/bikepacking_gear_buyers_guide_1_wildcat_gear_3-970x485.jpg\" alt=\"bikepacking_gear_buyers_guide_1_wildcat_gear_3\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In use, they’re very stable when packed correctly even off-road or when climbing out of the saddle. A full range of sizes is available to suit any bike and Wildcat even offers a custom fit service. With reasonable weight and high-quality fabrics throughout, the Wildcat range should be durable enough for the longest and biggest of adventures. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out the<a href=\"https://wildcat.cc/collections/bike-packing-bags\" target=\"_blank\"> full Wildcat range at Wildcat </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Wildcat Lion Handlebar harness <a href=\"https://wildcat.cc/products/lion-handlebar-harness\" target=\"_blank\">(£80)</a> and 13l drybag <a href=\"https://wildcat.cc/products/wildcat-double-ended-drybag-13l-black\" target=\"_blank\">(£45)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Wildcat Tiger Drover saddle harness <a href=\"https://wildcat.cc/products/tiger-drover-saddle-harness\" target=\"_blank\">(£85)</a> and 10l drybag <a href=\"https://wildcat.cc/products/wildcat-tapered-drybag-10l-black\" target=\"_blank\">(£35)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Wildcat Ocelot frame bag <a href=\"https://wildcat.cc/products/ocelot-frame-bag?variant=32726966501473\" target=\"_blank\">(from £115)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span>8.

Made from X-Pac X11 3-layer laminate fabric, the bag is highly water resistant, has a stiff rear panel to reduce movement and mounts directly onto the bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hugging close like its namesake, the 337g, 13-litre Koala seatpack is easy to fit. Employing a thin strap around the seatpost, these might not inspire confidence but were flawless in use. Although it must be packed well following the guidelines, we also found it exceptionally stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/alpkit-1.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Alpkit</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With well-placed, water-resistant zips, the Glider frame bag is also easy to use and offers ample storage with three sizes available. The main compartment provides plenty of room for kit on longer trips with internal tabs for strapping in tent poles and a mesh pocket with concealed cable port for battery/dynamo cables. The slim external pocket fits phones and cards neatly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an MTB option, we would suggest the Possum frame bag which is of similar ilk but made for mountain bikes </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All products come with an incredible 25-year ‘Alpine bond’ guarantee.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out the <a href=\"https://alpkit.com/collections/bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">full Alpkit bikepacking range at Alpkit </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Alpkit Glider frame bag <a href=\"https://alpkit.com/products/glider\" target=\"_blank\">(from £71.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Alpkit Koala saddle pack <a href=\"https://alpkit.com/products/koala?variant=40584065876073\" target=\"_blank\">(£89.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Alpkit Kuoka handle bar bag <a href=\"https://alpkit.com/products/kuoka-handlebar-bag\" target=\"_blank\">(£53.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking for more bikepacking inspiration?</em> <em>Check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">our introduction to bikepacking,</a> get the lowdown on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-clothes\" target=\"_blank\">how many clothes you should take on a multi-day adventure </a>and read all about <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-fuel\" target=\"_blank\">how to fuel on a bikepacking trip </a> </em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\">Buyer’s guide: Best bikepacking bags</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3682b64ed180d7ac92596c5e6a11953ccc62d6dd194828e97cfa491bd4e2e8fa","category":"Cycling"}
