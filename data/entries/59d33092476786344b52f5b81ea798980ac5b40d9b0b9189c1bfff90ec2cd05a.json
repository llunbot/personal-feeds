The stunning frameset was produced as part of Deviate’s exploration into how they can bring manufacturing to the UK at a price that is competitive with the Asia-made carbon frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we learn there is a second prototype titanium bike from the Scottish brand, aptly named the Tilander. It’s a 145mm travel high-pivot bike, very much based upon the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/deviate-highlander-ii-evolves-as-a-145mm-high-pivot-do-it-all/\" target=\"_blank\">145mm Highlander</a>.

Sadly, it is not available to purchase, and indeed it may never be. Its creation was something of a proof-of-concept, an early-phase prototype produced as a learning tool for Deviate whose ambition, ultimately, is to manufacture frames in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-lower-link-concentric-to-bb.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The Tilander’s lower link articulates about a pivot concentric to the BB</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"deviate tilander high main pivot lower link concentric to bb\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-non-drive-side-main-pivot.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The very high position of the main pivot forces use of an idler pulley</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-deviate-claymore-is-a-165mm-travel-high-pivot-enduro-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Claymore</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/deviate-highlander-ii-evolves-as-a-145mm-high-pivot-do-it-all/\" target=\"_blank\">Highlander</a> frames are produced in Asia from carbon fiber, but the brand see a future where  some, or all, of their frames are produced from titanium in the UK, or more specifically, Scotland. From a technological standpoint, it is entirely possible; there are plenty of boutique brands offering UK-made titanium frames, but costs are somewhat astronomical. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will always be a small portion of the market willing to pay the price for titanium’s high strength-to-weight ratio, its isotropic properties and of course, its strikingly beautiful aesthetic. But, Deviate want to do things differently, producing titanium frames at a price competitive with Asia-made carbon frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

Working with titanium is infamously difficult, requiring much more tightly-controlled manufacturing conditions than those needed for steel or aluminum, and oftentimes tens of hours of manual post-processing. Those are two factors that contribute to the high costs usually associated with titanium bikes, not to mention the cost of the material itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Ben and Chris from Deviate Cycles believe they may have stumbled across a more economical, cost-effective method of manufacture. Admittedly, they aren’t anywhere near the production cost they’re aiming for just yet, but forecasting that considers the scalability of the method suggests it’s certainly not impossible. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-lowlander-prototype-frame-concept-bike.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The 125mm travel Deviate Lowlander is not strictly-speaking a rideable prototype; it was produced as a proof-of-concept for both the manufacturing method and the downcountry frame design that Chris has had on the back-burner for some time.

The method is said to produce titanium parts that have around 97% the density of a machined block of titanium, and at a significantly reduced cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"deviate tilander seat tube lug titanium 3d printed cold metal fusion surface detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deviate-tilander-high-pivot-titanium-trail-bike-ti-lug-finish.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The surface finish is smoother, so we don’t need to spend as much time finishing.

You can see examples of these structures in <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">this half-finished build plate</a> of Atherton Bikes titanium lugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“When it comes to material, we only use what’s needed. In aerospace they call it the “buy to fly” ratio – we have a buy to fly ratio of nearly one, which is as good as it gets. We’ll have a tiny amount of loss in loose powder but if something goes wrong, we can actually reuse that loose powder that we take off, and we can also reuse broken parts before they’re sintered</em>.” – Johannes Schaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deviate’s efforts are certainly to be applauded, but they’re wasted if the bike doesn’t ride nicely. On this, Chris Deverson says, “<em>Well, it’s beautiful to ride a titanium bike, of course and the Ti-lander acceleration response is totally unlike the carbon frame! There’s a certain spring to your inputs that’s difficult to describe. But it’s certainly a good feeling</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll be staying in touch with the guys at Deviate to follow the evolution of Project Tilander.
