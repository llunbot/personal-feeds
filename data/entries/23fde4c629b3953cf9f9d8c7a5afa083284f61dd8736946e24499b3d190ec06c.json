{"title":"Taipei Show Tech Randoms: Wheels, Drivetrain & Vanlife","link":"https://bikerumor.com/taipei-show-tech-randoms-wheels-drivetrain-vanlife/","date":1681159459000,"content":"<p>Here’s more goodness from the Taipei Cycle Show floor, this time with plenty of wheels, hubs, rims and some interesting new drivetrain tech, plus a few things from Dirty Formosa’s outdoor pavilion showcasing a bit of the car camping and vanlife scene from the island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BLKTEC’s C1D wheels had a quiet launch a few months back but had a solid presence at the show on multiple booth bikes. Aimed at road and all-road riders, the one-piece, full carbon construction uses thick, non-radial spokes for zero lateral or torsional flex, putting all of your power into forward motion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rims are hookless, so they’re tubeless-only, and have a 20.7mm internal width to fit tires from 25mm to 35mm wide. Rim depth is 40mm, and claimed rim-only weight is 380g, complete wheels are 695g (front) and 796g (rear). Rider+bike weight limit is 120kg (~265lbs). The only downside? A budget-busting $4,880 MSRP! We have a set of these on test.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"blktec carbon fiber bottle cage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blktec-carbon-wheels-bottle-cage-03.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not yet listed on their website is this 13g carbon bottle cage, which makes it the third-lightest cage we saw at the show. <a href=\"https://www.blktec.com\" target=\"_blank\">BLKTEC</a> is more known for their cockpits, which were displayed on a beautiful steel road bike in their booth (check that in our “<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/17-weird-wonderful-bikes-from-taipei-cycle-show-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikes Roundup</a>” from the show).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ffwd outlaw mountain bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-01.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ffwdwheels.com\" target=\"_blank\">FFWD</a> was showing off prototype mountain bike wheels, their first ever from the traditionally road and triathlon brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04-800x297.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ffwd outlaw mountain bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04-800x297.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04-768x285.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04-1536x570.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffwd-outlaw-mountain-bike-wheels-04.jpg 1820w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Called “Outlaw” and coming later this year, they’ll have 20mm deep hookless rims with a 30mm internal width.

They say traditional designs end up resting one edge of the nipple on the rim’s eyelet or hole, which causes uneven forces that can bend or weaken the spoke and wear the nipple out more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"recon components slide-on XD freehub adapter to fit normal cassettes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/recon-components-XD-adapter-for-cassettes-02.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.recon-harry.com.tw\" target=\"_blank\">Recon Components</a> makes ultralight CNC’d cassettes, but only for traditional HG freehub bodies. Rather than reinvent the design and work their way around SRAM’s patents, they created (rather ingeniously, I might add) a sleeve that threads onto XD freehub bodies (the black bit on the end of the hub). Then you just slide their cassettes onto that, where the back slots into the notches made for XD-compatible cassettes, and tighten it on with a standard lock ring. Brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"hub smith 60 and 90 tooth hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-04.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02-800x297.jpg\" alt=\"hub smith 60 and 90 tooth hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02-800x297.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02-768x285.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02-1536x570.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hubsmith-60-90-tooth-pawls-e-bike-hub-motor-02.jpg 1820w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubsmith.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hubsmith’s</a> HS-G001R hub has typically come with a 60-tooth drive ring (shown above, on left) for a 6º engagement, engaging all six pawls at once.

With the patent expiration for star ratchets, they’ve ramped up production of those, saying their ability to do the high-precision machining gives them an advantage in offering 36- and 54-tooth star ratchet systems…and that business has been quite good over the past couple of years because of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this hub (shown above) shows off another use of their machining prowess – a 6-pawl ratchet with 204 points of engagement from 102 teeth and an offset 3 on/3 off pawl design. That translates to a less-than-1º engagement for ultra-quick pick up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Fun 5 degree bottom bracket bearings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-03.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>Note the outer bearing race’s 5º angle, also visible with the cutaway on the right-hand edge of the photo.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05-800x297.jpg\" alt=\"Fun 5 degree bottom bracket bearings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05-800x297.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05-768x285.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05-1536x570.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fun-5-degree-bottom-bracket-bearings-05.jpg 1820w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fun 5º bottom bracket has a unique way of keeping bearings in line while also making them very easy to replace. Each bearing, and the “cup” in the BB’s shell that they fit into, is angled at five degrees. So, rather than requiring special tools to remove and a press to put new ones in, you just pull them out and pop them in. Super easy.
