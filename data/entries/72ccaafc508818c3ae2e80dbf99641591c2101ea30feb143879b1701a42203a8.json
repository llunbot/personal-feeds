His company name is named after a mashup of his childhood favorite bike company, Seven, and the name Æthelwealh, who was the first king of the Sussex area where his shop is presently located. This Axe model is Æight’s hardtail, and originally Glen rode it with flat bars.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aeight-Axe-Drop-Bar-MTB-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aeight-Axe-Drop-Bar-MTB-31.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aeight-Axe-Drop-Bar-MTB-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aeight-Axe-Drop-Bar-MTB-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Wanting something more fast-paced for beach racing, he built it up as it sits today and decided to do a refresh on the frame. Glen contacted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/velofique/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Velofique,</a> his only instruction: “Do as you wish.” The resulting paint job is one of wonder and awe, with a dark, deep, dank forest scheme up front, faded to a candle-smoke-striped rear.

Antidote developed their own suspension design called NanoFlex. This rear suspension design offers 20 mm of rear travel as the seat stays pivot counter-clockwise along an eccentric elastomer to maintain traction while the chainstay flexes.

With a 200 kg (440 lb) Max weight, Asteroid can be configured to have a 400 mm, 600 mm or, 1 meter front loading platform. The Asteroid 60cm option will keep the load safe and low, allowing you to carry three kids plus groceries, or as your kids grow, the family dog can come along too. The 20inch model with 40cm box is shorter than a regular bike, so that you can use secure public bike lockups or vertical storage in the corner of the office. All of the e-bike motors and batteries use different mounting systems, so Asteroid has a modular adapter plate. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/asteroid_bicycles/\" target=\"_blank\">@AsteroidCargo</a></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.aucklandcycle.works/pages/suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">Auckland Cycle Works Marra V2.3 Full Suspension</a></h3>\n<p>Around 2002, Gary Ewing was riding around the Peak District on a full-suspension bike with Mike Hall, known to many for his legendary status as a Tour Divide and ultra-distance racer (ride in peace, Mike). Gary mused that the dominant theory for calculating anti-squat forces in the rear triangle assumed the swingarm and chain formed a triangle, but the vertical height of the cassette meant it couldn’t be a triangle, it had to be a parallelogram. Mike commented to Gary that the answer for this could be building a bike with suspension, in Mike’s words, “Kind of like a rearward pivot.” The idea stuck in Gary’s mind.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Aukland-Cycle-Works-Full-Suspension-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>After Mike’s untimely death in 2017, Gary was riding around Hamsterley Forest, on a nicely balanced 4-bar Horst Link full sus, near his <a href=\"https://www.inspiralcycles.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Inspiral Cycles</a> bike shop in Bishop Auckland, Northeast England.

This rocking motion can lead to significant inefficiencies, so a brace was required. Hoping to help out, several UK builders teamed up and developed a proof-of-concept prototype for the Sunbirds: a carbon “stub” cover with a cleat that bolts to an adjustable arm, which clamps onto a seatpost.

Well, why not?” he said to me, noting that he thinks it’s an overlooked material in the bespoke framebuilder community. It’s easier to work with than steel, lighter, and more resistant to corrosion. For Russell, who builds from his home, keeping overhead down is crucial. Working with this material is also more cost-effective for machining or CNCing small parts without resorting to 3D printing or other processes in steel.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stout_cycles\" target=\"_blank\">@StoutCycles</a></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-5.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-5.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-32.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-32.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-23.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-23.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-23.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Jaegher-Stainless-All-Road-23.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.jaegher.be/overview-hurricane-fl-xr-allroad#entry:9951@1:url\" target=\"_blank\">Jaegher FLX Hurricane Gravel Bike</a></h3>\n<p>Back in 2016, I documented the Belgium-based stainless steel framebuilders Jaegher Cycles at the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/jaegher-brown-and-orange-road/\" target=\"_blank\">Berliner Fahrradschau.</a> It was nice to reconnect with the brand’s clean lines and stunning finish work almost ten years later at Bespoked UK.
