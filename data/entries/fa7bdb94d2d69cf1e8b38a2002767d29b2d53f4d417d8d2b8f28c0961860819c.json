Veriwave Telco \"has not complied with FCC call blocking rules for providers suspected of carrying illegal traffic\" and now has two weeks to contest an <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-645A1.pdf\">order</a> that would require all downstream voice providers to block all of the telco's call traffic, the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-prepares-block-provider-facilitating-illegal-tax-robocalls\">FCC announced yesterday</a>.</p>\n<p>Robocalls sent in the months before tax filing season \"purported to provide information about a 'National Tax Relief Program' and, in some instances, also discussed a 'Tax Dismissal Program,'\" the FCC order said. \"The [Enforcement] Bureau has found no evidence of the existence of either program. Many of the messages further appealed to recipients with the offer to 'rapidly clear' their tax debt.\"</p>\n<p>Call recipients who listened to the prerecorded message and chose to speak to an operator were then asked to provide private information. Nearly 16 million calls were sent, though it's unclear how many went through Veriwave.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035880#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035880&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa7bdb94d2d69cf1e8b38a2002767d29b2d53f4d417d8d2b8f28c0961860819c","category":"Tech"}
