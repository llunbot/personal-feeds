{"title":"Eddy Cue, on the Stand in U.S. v. Google Trial, Says Apple Is Eying a Move to AI in Safari","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/apple-working-to-move-to-ai-search-in-browser-amid-google-fallout","date":1746665873000,"content":"\n<p>Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. is “actively looking at” revamping the Safari web\nbrowser on its devices to focus on AI-powered search engines, a\nseismic shift for the industry hastened by the potential end of a\nlongtime partnership with Google.</p>\n\n<p>Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, made the\ndisclosure Wednesday during his testimony in the US Justice\nDepartment’s lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. The heart of the\ndispute is the two companies’ estimated $20 billion-a-year deal\nthat makes Google the default offering for queries in Apple’s\nbrowser. The case could force the tech giants to unwind the\npact, upending how the iPhone and other devices have long\noperated.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that upheaval, AI is already making gains with consumers.\nCue noted that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last\nmonth, which he attributed to people using AI. Cue said he\nbelieves that AI search providers, including OpenAI, Perplexity AI\nInc. and Anthropic PBC, will eventually replace standard search\nengines like Alphabet’s Google. He said he believes Apple will\nbring those options to Safari in the future.</p>\n\n<p>“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the\ndefault,” he said, indicating that they still need to improve. Cue\nspecifically said the company has had some discussions with\nPerplexity. “Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the\nothers were valid choices,” Cue said. “I think today there is much\ngreater potential because there are new entrants attacking the\nproblem in a different way.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they can pay, Apple will listen. And I don’t think it’s bullshit, at all, that traditional web search is actually going into decline now because of AI. Honestly at this point it would be weird if it weren’t.</p>\n\n<p>But. Let’s say Apple would prefer for the current arrangement between Apple and Google to continue as is. But it’s under threat as a remedy in Google’s monopoly case. Is this not the perfect testimony? Traditional web search is in decline, usage-wise — and Apple is considering deals with multiple upstarts. I think it’s all true. But I also think it helps make the case that the current deal between Apple and Google should not be disallowed.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think there’s any bullshit here. I think we’re at a highly competitive moment between browsers and chatbots and between old-school search and new-school AI. And I think Eddy Cue is right in the middle of it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, a really interesting nugget that, according to Cue, searches in Safari dropped last month for the first time ever.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/07/eddy-cue-safari-ai\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"291797b1b069d9ed90c1531dc86eb875069cec5fd17e03fd337748d4aee7362e","category":"Tech"}
