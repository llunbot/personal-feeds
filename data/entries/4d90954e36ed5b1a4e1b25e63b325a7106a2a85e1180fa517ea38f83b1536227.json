And the latest update sees the introduction of a sprint-specific version of the top-tier RC9, a trickle-down of performance tech to the RC7 and RC5 road shoes, and some new limited colourways of existing models. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The S-Phyre RC902T, a track and sprint focussed offering</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in its third generation, the S-Phyre RC9 has stood as Shimano’s top-tier road racing shoe for a number of years, and while that shoe remains, it is now accompanied by a new track and sprint version – the RC902T.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RC902T (US$430 / AU$549) remains extremely similar to the regular RC902 and quite simply replaces the second (lower) Boa Li2 dial with a single velcro strap in order to gain compatibility with toe straps for track racing. The velcro strap also saves approximately 5 grams per shoe. This new model is only available in white and in a standard fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that a similar version of this shoe was available with the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/12/shimano-s-phyre-rc901-vs-rc701-road-footwear-review/\" target=\"_blank\">RC901</a> and I’m told some road sprinters preferred the fit offered by the lower velcro strap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has also announced a limited edition “Dura-Ace” colourway of the regular S-Phyre RC9 (RC902). Designed to match the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/new-shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9200-and-ultegra-di2-r8100-everything-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">new groupsets</a>, these shoes feature an enamelled black upper, a gloss black heel cup, and pearl-coloured Boa Li2 dials. These shoes will be available in limited quantities and sizes ranging from EU42-48 in standard and E-widths (wide) fits. They’re priced at US$430 / AU$549. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The new RC702 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting in the line-up as Shimano’s second-tier road race shoe, the RC7 has been overhauled with what’s said to more closely mimic the RC9 that sits above it. Compared to the previous <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/12/shimano-s-phyre-rc901-vs-rc701-road-footwear-review/\" target=\"_blank\">RC701</a>, the new RC702 features a new upper with breathable mesh panels now placed within the synthetic upper. That upper now wraps around the foot in a similar way to the S-Phyre RC9, and it’s also now seamlessly integrated with the carbon midsole. The seamless integration of the upper and midsole has resulted in a stack height reduction from a claimed 8.8 mm to 5.5 mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shimano-RC702-road-cycling-shoes-white-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The more affordable RC7 gets a welcomed overhaul. Previously this second-tier shoe was more like a 105-level offering, so hopefully, these updates help raise the bar. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RC7 features the same Boa L6 dials as before (RC902 has Boa Li2 dials), a carbon sole with a 10/12 stiffness rating (RC902 is 12/12), and unlike the RC902, there is no antimicrobial odour control on the innersole. At a claimed 510 g for a pair (EU42), it appears to have gained approximately 20 g compared to the previous version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your location the new RC7 is available in a few different colours but most markets will offer the standard white that fades to black. These shoes are produced in standard fit sizes of EU38-50 and E-widths of EU40-48, as well as some half-size options – check with your local seller for sizing offered in your region. Expect to pay US$240 / AU$299 for these. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>RC5 and RC5W (women’s) are new, too </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Priced at US$170 / AU$239, the new RC5 and RC5W (Women’s) receive more subtle updates compared to the wholly overhauled RC7. Here the entry-level road racing shoe gains a new synthetic leather upper and a carbon-fibre reinforced nylon midsole. The new RC5 continues to feature a single Boa L6 dial accompanied by a velcro strap over the ball of the foot, while the sole stiffness remains unchanged at a claimed 8/12. Also unchanged is the stack height at a claimed 6.5 mm. The new RC5 (and RC5W) have dropped approximately 18 g for a size EU42. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The women’s version offers the same features but with a narrower-fitting last and different colour options. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New look RX8 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/03/shimano-rx8-gravel-shoe-review-not-just-mountain-bike-kicks/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano RX8 gravel race shoe</a> has gained a couple of new colourways to help you camouflage yourself in with the surrounding terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shimano-RX8-gravel-shoe-bronze-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>So gravel. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has also produced a bronze colourway in a standard fit and a yellow gold colourway in the narrower women’s-specific fit, but these are not available in all markets. Structurally the shoes are unchanged from the original RX8. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shimano-RC902T-track-edition-shoes-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The RC902T is designed for track riders and sprinters.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shimano-RC902S-Dura-Ace-edition-shoes-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>There’s a new limited colourway of the regular S-Phyre RC902. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shimano-RC902S-Dura-Ace-edition-shoes-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The limited S-Phyre RC902S is designed to match the new R9200 you may have on backorder. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shimano-RC702-road-cycling-shoes-white-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The more affordable RC7 gets a welcomed overhaul.
