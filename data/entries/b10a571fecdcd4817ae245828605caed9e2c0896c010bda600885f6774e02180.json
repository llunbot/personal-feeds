The keys are rounded \nand have a bit of space in between each one, but the layout \noverall feels familiar and well done. The keyboard layout is also \nspecifically designed to be really similar to the default iOS \nkeyboard, which makes it feel all the more familiar. </p>\n\n<p>Each key is also backlit and has an excellent tactile response. \nThat’s the aspect I was most concerned about, and while some of \nthe pre-production models were a little rough, the final version \nthat I was able to test during my hands-on (not pictured) felt \n<em>perfect</em>. It was clicky and tactile without being loud or too \nhard to press. [...] </p>\n\n<p>In my brief time using it, I’m very much of the opinion that \nClicks is pretty much as good as this concept can be. It’s \nwell-designed, comfortable to use, and hits all of the right \nnotes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/15/clicks-hands-on\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b10a571fecdcd4817ae245828605caed9e2c0896c010bda600885f6774e02180","category":"Tech"}
