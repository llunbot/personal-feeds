With Paris-Roubaix out of the way, it’s now time to turn to the rolling countryside of Benelux for the Ardennes Classics. It all kicks off this weekend in the Netherlands with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/amstel-gold-race-preview\" target=\"_blank\">the men’s and women’s Amstel Gold Races</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both races will take place on Sunday 20th April, with the women tackling a 157.4km-long course and the men a 255.9km route whose finish will feature the climb of the Cauberg for the first time in nearly a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First to finish on Sunday will be the women’s race, which will show off all the key contenders for the upcoming Tour de France Femmes. We’re talking Demi Vollering, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, Kasia Niewiadoma, Anna van der Breggen and Elisa Longo Borghini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the afternoon, the men’s race will see Tadej Pogačar aim to take his first title in a potential Ardennes Triple this year. Here to stop him will be reigning champion Tom Pidcock, Wout van Aert and Remco Evenepoel, who will be making his 2025 WorldTour debut at Amstel Gold this weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Amstel Gold Race 2025 men’s favourites</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tadej Pogačar</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-10-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest name on the startline on Sunday will be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>. After an impressive Paris-Roubaix debut last weekend that saw him finish second behind Mathieu van der Poel, the Slovenian will start his Ardennes campaign in the Limburg Hills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar won this race in 2023, having escaped from a lead group of riders with around 30km to go. On that occasion, he looked remarkably comfortable on the <em>parcours</em>, using some of the less testing ramps as springboards to get away from his competitors that year. Although there’s around 200m less elevation gain in this year’s course, the return to the Cauberg finale may suit Pogačar well, with his explosive climbing kick likely to be a useful asset on the slopes of the 1km ascent, which the riders summit for the final time just 2.5km from the finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the attacks come early or it comes down to the Cauberg, Pogačar will be the most targeted rider in the field over the weekend. Bluntly put, any result that isn’t on the podium will be a disappointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Remco Evenepoel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-7-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After several months out of action, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> makes his return to racing this week. The Brabantse Pijl on Friday will give us our first glimpse into how the Belgian’s form sits following that broken collarbone in the winter. That said, given the time he’s taken over his recovery he’ll surely be loking to be fully competitive again on his return, especially with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/liege-bastogne-liege\" target=\"_blank\">Liège-Bastogne-Liège</a> following next weekend after Amstel Gold on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Provided he is fully fit and ready for action, Evenepoel should be one of the favourites for victory on Sunday. He’s never taken part in Amstel Gold before, but the undulating profile and open roads should suit him, and the route could suit the kind of long-range move characteristic of many of Evenepoel’s previous victories at WorldTour level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His biggest obstacle is that Pogačar has almost all the skills needed to match any move he makes, and is in excellent form too. And with Pogačar also likely to beat the 2022 Vuelta champion in a sprint, Evenepoel’s best chance of victory is to find a way to escape the field between the 50km to 20km to go markers and hope to survive on the Cauberg.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/100-wins-club\">How significant is joining the 100 wins club?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/brabantse-pijl-preview\">Brabantse Pijl 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\">Tadej Pogačar interview: Light is the crown</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-amstel-gold-race\">How to watch the Amstel Gold Race 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/amstel-gold-race-preview\">Amstel Gold Race 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start lists</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2025: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h3>Tom Pidcock</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2148609028-1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"BERG EN TERBLIJT, NETHERLANDS - APRIL 14: Thomas Pidcock of The United Kingdom and Team INEOS Grenadiers celebrates at podium as race winner drinking a beer during the 58th Amstel Gold Race 2024 - Men´s Elite a 253.6km one day race from Maastricht to Berg en Terblijt on / #UCIWT / April 14, 2024 in Berg en Terblijt, Netherlands.

He’s been sprightly on the climbs, winning the AlUla Tour back in February before finishing inside the top ten at Tirreno-Adriatico last month. The Brit has been on a bit of a hiatus since then, having skipped the cobbled Classics – a surprisingly choice after his impressive performance at Strade Bianche in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for consistency, Pidcock has a strong pedigree here at Amstel Gold. Out of four attempts, he’s finished on the podium on three occasions – including that cruel photo finish in 2021 that saw him just lose out on victory to Wout van Aert. A big fan of this route, Pidcock will be eager to get his Ardennes campaign off to a good start, particularly with the Giro d’Italia looming on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wout van Aert</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-80-min-620x413.jpg 620w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another former winner on the startline on Sunday will be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a>. Coming off a pair of fourth-place finishes at the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Van Aert has been consistent so far in the Classics, though his failure to quite match the excellence of Pogačar and Van der Poel has been the subject of a fair amount of disappointment from fans and critics alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert was scrutinised for his pre-Roubaix preparation. He came back from an altitude camp the week before the Tour of Flanders, meaning that he missed most of the cobbled warm-up races. On the other hand, given that the Belgian was over in Spain climbing away on that camp last month, Van Aert’s unpopular choice to head to altitude may actually play into his hands in the Ardennes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Pogačar and Evenepoel’s attacks might be a bridge too far for the Belgian, but his not-so-secret weapon in the sprints will give him a clear edge if he comes over the top of the Cauberg for the final time in a small group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Outside bets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1705\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209762079-scaled.webp\" alt=\"URDUNA, SPAIN - APRIL 11: Ben Healy of Ireland and Team EF Education - EasyPost competes in the breakaway during the 64th Itzulia Basque Country 2025, Stage 5 a 172.3km stage from Urduna to Urduna / #UCIWT / on April 11, 2025 in Urduna, Spain.

Outside of them, however, there’s a competitive startlist of other <em>puncheurs </em>hoping to get their Ardennes campaign off to a good start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romain Grégoire is a youngster to keep your eye on. The Groupama-FDJ rider looked strong last week at Itzulia Basque Country and Tirreno-Adriatico last month. His results have been improving in 2025 so far, so a top ten or top five is well within his grasp. It was he, after all, who briefly was able to follow Van der Poel, Pogačar and Pippo Ganna on the Cipressa at Milan-San Remo earlier this year following their seismic attack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Runner-up in 2023, Ben Healy looks to be back in form ahead of the Ardennes Classics. He recently claimed a stage win at Itzulia Basque Country, and his climbing legs have been in decent shape since the beginning of the season. His sprint is his downfall, so a feisty day at the front of the race will be necessary for the Irishman to get on the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Maxim Van Gils will be making his return to the Ardennes after a brief break. The Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe was one of the stars of last year’s Classics season, so there’s a fair expectation that the Belgian will be back to form. Another Belgian, Thibeau Nys of Lidl-Trek will be a closely watched contender. The young cyclocross star has an explosive kick, which has helped him garner WorldTour victories already in his young career. He’ll be making his Ardennes debut in 2025, so remember the name.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/100-wins-club\">How significant is joining the 100 wins club?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/brabantse-pijl-preview\">Brabantse Pijl 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\">Tadej Pogačar interview: Light is the crown</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-amstel-gold-race\">How to watch the Amstel Gold Race 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/amstel-gold-race-preview\">Amstel Gold Race 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start lists</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2025: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Amstel Gold Race 2025 women’s favourites</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Demi Vollering</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2202652876-1-scaled.webp\" alt=\"GHENT, BELGIUM - MARCH 01: Demi Vollering of Netherlands and Team FDJ - Suez prior to the 17th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025, Women's Elite a 137.9km one day race from Ghent to Ninove / #UCIWWT / on March 01, 2025 in Ghent, Belgium.

Having won both races two years ago, she’s no stranger to lifting her arms in glory at this time of year on bumpy Ardennes profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vollering has an impressive record at Amstel Gold. Of course, she won the race back in 2023, but before that, she finished as runner-up in 2022 and 2021. Last year was a bit of a miss, as a mid-race neutralisation allowed the sprinters, including Vollering’s former teammate Lorena Wiebes, to come back into the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her past results at Amstel Gold, a podium place is almost a certainty for the FDJ-Suez leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Elisa Longo Borghini</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/13rd-Dwars-door-Vlaanderen-2025-Womens-Elite-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini is always someone to look out for the Classics, regardless of terrain or road surface. She’s already claimed a WorldTour victory in 2025 at the one-day Dwaars door Vlaanderen. Despite a stripped-back Classics schedule though, she’s still managed to leave an impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UAE Team ADQ leader has quite the kick on her, so her firepower will play to her advantage on the Cauberg and Geulhemmerberg. Later on, her reliable sprint could see her edge out fellow Swiss Army knives like Vollering and Ferrand-Prévot if a group comes to the line. The Italian has never won Amstel Gold, but it feels as though her career has been building up to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a big question mark to be addressed here, however. Longo Borghini suffered a concussion at the Tour of Flanders at the start of April. Her squad seemed quite pragmatic about her recovery plan at first, but now she’s been added to the Brabantse Pijl and Amstel Gold lineups to considerable’ surprise from some quarters. If she’s recovered from that injury and a lack of training in the legs since Flanders, however, then she should be in good stead. If not, we may see a repeat of Strade Bianche.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pauline Ferrand-Prévot</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Womens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-12-avril-2025-8-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pauline Ferrand-Prévot has been on stellar form since the beginning of her grand comeback to road racing this year. She netted a third place at Strade Bianche, followed up by a runners-up spot at Tour of Flanders, then the big cheese of victory at Paris-Roubaix. Reading her form, she has to be a favourite for a first Amstel Gold title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When pairing the Amstel Gold route to the Frenchwoman’s capabilities, she should have a strong enough kick to go with the attacks early on, or on the final ascent of the Cauberg. Crucially, she also possesses the engine to make the difference on the final 1.8km-long plateau towards the finish line, where this race can often be decided. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her Visma-Lease a Bike team will be able to play two cards, with Marianne Vos also here to contest a sprint if it comes down to one. Over the past weeks, the pair worked well in collaboration, reviving their old partnership from Rabobank days almost a decade ago. If Vollering and Longo Borghini decide to test the bunch far out, Ferrand-Prévot should become the team’s priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lotte Kopecky</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-100-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One race to evade the rainbow-coloured hands of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lotte-kopecky\" target=\"_blank\">Lotte Kopecky</a> during her road career is this one, Amstel Gold. Looking at the route, there’s no reason why Kopecky can’t add this to her illustrious <em>palmarès</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky is a slightly unknown quantity in Amstel Gold, however. She has only competed in the race twice in her career, in 2023 and 2024. Her highest placing was on her debut in 2023 when she made the podium behind her then-teammate Vollering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teammates may be the cause of her downfall again this weekend. At Paris-Roubaix, we saw Kopecky sacrifice herself for Lorena Wiebes, just like she did at Milan-San Remo earlier in the year. The same could happen on Sunday, given how close the Dutch sprinter was to winning the event last year. Anna van der Breggen may also arm the team with another card to play, in an attempt to match the likes of Ferrand-Prévot and Vollering. It’s SD Worx at the end of the day, and we never quite know if their tactics will spell perfection or total chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marianne Vos</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-37-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike’s Marianne Vos is the only rider in the women’s peloton to have won Amstel Gold twice in her career. Based on this, it’s hard to look past her as a favourite on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, her two wins have come from larger group sprints, not from solo moves or a small breakaway group. If Vollering and co put on the pressure from far out, Vos may be in the backseat, especially if Ferrand-Prévot is looking like a stronger option on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She might not have the same explosiveness to break free now as she did a decade ago when she won the rainbow jersey on a similar profile, but her sprint is still strong enough to beat plenty of her rivals. No one is going to be celebrating prematurely with Vos in the group after what happened last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Outside bets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/MArianne-Vos-wins-Amstel-Gold-Race-ahead-of-Lorena-Wiebes-by-MARCEL-VAN-HOORN-of-ANP-via-Getty-Images.jpg 1417w\" /><figcaption>Marcel van Hoorn/ANP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Classics season has been quite unpredictable for the women. We’ve seen some surprising figures towards the head of affairs, with some even managing to make it onto the podium. I mean, who had Letizia Borghesi down for second place at Paris-Roubaix?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already mentioned in this article, Van der Breggen is a rider to watch. She won this race back in 2017, before her break from racing, but her form so far this year indicates that she might be back to her previous level. Kasia Niewiadoma is another pre-pandemic winner of this race. She’s often gone well here, but her form has been rather patchy so far this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of <em>puncheurs</em>, Liane Lippert and Puck Pieterse spring to mind. The former rode a phenomenal Tour of Flanders, eventually finishing on the podium. Lippert has been close to victory at Amstel Gold before, so it wouldn’t be out of her depth to be up towards the front on the Cauberg. As for Pieterse, the Spring Classics have been a little more underwhelming. She’s been there and thereabouts all year, but she’s not made the podium of a major race yet in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it ends in a sprint, Elisa Balsamo and Wiebes should be in the frame. Otherwise, Kim Le Court, Karlijn Swinkels and Letizia Paternoster could be in the top ten, regardless of how the race pans out on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/amstel-gold-race-favourites\">Who are the favourites for Amstel Gold Race 2025?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bdeaeb0009850642360be8849ec20b670c5f325d579c36e1b1a17d5e3f38535f","category":"Cycling"}
