If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine sentencing based on U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nO'Connor's role in the Twitter attack was previously highlighted by <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/\">Krebs on Security</a>, and in a 2020 interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html\">The New York Times</a></em>, O'Connor claimed that he was not involved in the hack. \"They can come arrest me,\" he said. \"I would laugh at them. I haven't done anything.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGraham Ivan Clark, an 18-year-old considered to be the \"mastermind\" of the attack, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/florida-teenager-prison-apple-twitter-bitcoin-hack/\">was sentenced</a> to three years in prison earlier this year. Mason \"Chaewon\" Sheppard from the UK and Nima \"Rolex\" Fazeli have also been charged in the attack and are facing prison time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the 2020 attack, hackers targeted Twitter employees in a \"phone spear phishing attack,\" tricking them into thinking they were speaking to other Twitter employees. Using these methods, the hackers were able to gain access to Twitter's internal tools and were able to illicitly access Twitter accounts.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe parties involved <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/15/apple-twitter-account-hacked/\">hacked into accounts</a> belonging to Apple, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and more. Tweets were sent out from these accounts soliciting Bitcoin, and scammers received more than $100,000.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hack/\">hack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bitcoin/\">bitcoin</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/21/uk-citizen-arrested-2020-twitter-hack/\">22-Year-Old UK Citizen Arrested for 2020 Twitter Hack Affecting Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/22-year-old-uk-citizen-arrested-for-2020-twitter-hack-affecting-apple.2305012/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qq4xgp-Pyfc:ei6XkyUf4tQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qq4xgp-Pyfc:ei6XkyUf4tQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Qq4xgp-Pyfc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2f03c85f941b05c09b6ded7f13fb9b340d06c7b03abe3f8df01bfb8252d65e02","category":"Apple"}
