That's the promise of Stable Audio, a text-to-audio AI model <a href=\"https://stability.ai/research/stable-audio-efficient-timing-latent-diffusion\">announced Wednesday</a> by Stability AI that can synthesize stereo <a href=\"https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/44.1.html\">44.1 kHz</a> music or sounds from written descriptions. Before long, similar technology may challenge musicians for their jobs.</p>\n\n<p>If you'll recall, Stability AI is the company that helped fund the creation of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/\">Stable Diffusion</a>, a latent diffusion image synthesis model released in August 2022. Not content to limit itself to generating images, the company branched out into audio by backing <a href=\"https://www.harmonai.org/\">Harmonai</a>, an AI lab that launched music generator <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/07/ai-music-generator-dance-diffusion/\">Dance Diffusion</a> in September.</p>\n<p>Now Stability and Harmonai want to break into commercial AI audio production with Stable Audio. Judging by <a href=\"https://stability.ai/research/stable-audio-efficient-timing-latent-diffusion\">production samples</a>, it seems like a significant audio quality upgrade from previous AI audio generators we've seen.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968056#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968056&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4f4e5186682e5b4dd74af0f7c9c970dc5226569d61ab20ab10c9976a67c17fc3","category":"Tech"}
