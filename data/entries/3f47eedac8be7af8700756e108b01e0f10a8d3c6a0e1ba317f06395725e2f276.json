It wasn’t for the lack of specs or interest—in fact it sold quite well—but the line was overshadowed by the cheaper Macintosh. Resources and parts were scarce for the Macintosh XL and Apple ran out of stock forever just three months later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macintosh TV (4 months)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Apple TV before streaming was a thing, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/10/25/Apple-rolls-out-Macintosh-TV/2042751521600/&amp;xcust=1-1-2311687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Macintosh TV</a> was supposed to be the device that combined personal computing with home entertainment. With a built-in 14-inch Sony Trinitron display and all of the necessary audio/video inputs including a coaxial cable input, the Macintosh TV combined Apple’s iconic all-in-one design with “new media capabilities that create a whole new category of computing and entertainment devices.” It didn’t catch on and Apple pulled the plug on its first TV project just four months later.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Power Mac G4 Cube\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The Power Mac G4 Cube was built for success, but never got off the ground.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Power Mac G4 Cube\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The Power Mac G4 Cube was built for success, but never got off the ground.</p></figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.rrauction.com&amp;xcust=1-1-2311687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">RR Auction</a></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Power Mac G4 Cube\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/g4-cube.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The Power Mac G4 Cube was built for success, but never got off the ground.</p></figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.rrauction.com&amp;xcust=1-1-2311687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">RR Auction</a></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.rrauction.com&amp;xcust=1-1-2311687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">RR Auction</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Mac G4 Cube (11 months)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/159792/cube.html\">Power Mac G4 Cube</a> made a huge splash at Macworld New York in 2000. A mini high-end tower packed inside a beautiful floating acrylic square with an ingenious handle to access the internal parts, the Power Mac G4 Cube should have been a runaway hit. Instead, the high price and various cosmetic and performance issues kept sales at bay, and less than a year later, Apple <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/07/03Apple-Puts-Power-Mac-G4-Cube-on-Ice/&amp;xcust=1-1-2311687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">put the whole project</a> “on ice.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>eMate (11 months)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the iBook there was a small translucent portable Mac called the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/219958/the-forgotten-emate-300-15-years-later.html\">eMate 300</a>, which was geared toward the education market. The ultraportable laptop had a 25MHz ARM CPU, 1MB of RAM, and 2MB of flash memory for a very affordable $799. The eMate was ultimately a victim of Apple’s new direction under Steve Jobs, but that’s not the last we would see of transparent plastic cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPod Hi-Fi (19 months)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back when the company’s iconic music player was at the height of its popularity, Apple tried to cash in on the dedicated speaker market with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/179028/ipodhifireview.html\">iPod Hi-Fi</a>, a high-end audio system made specifically for the iPod. The boombox-esque design with exposed speakers and glossy white chassis was extremely big and heavy and had one job as a somewhat precarious $349 iPod dock. It lasted less than two years—during which time another new product named the iPhone arrived. That one would last a little longer.</p>\n\niPhone, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3f47eedac8be7af8700756e108b01e0f10a8d3c6a0e1ba317f06395725e2f276","category":"Apple"}
