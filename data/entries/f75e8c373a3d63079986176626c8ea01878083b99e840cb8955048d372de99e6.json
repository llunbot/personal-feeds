Most people use their Nvidia GPUs for games, but why not both? Nvidia has a new AI you can run at the same time, having just<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-companion-for-rtx-ai-pcs/\">Â released</a> its experimental G-Assist AI. It runs locally on your GPU to help you optimize your PC and get the most out of your games. It can do some neat things, but Nvidia isn't kidding when it says this tool is experimental.</p>\n<p>G-Assist is available in the Nvidia desktop app, and it consists of a floating overlay window. After invoking the overlay, you can either type or speak to G-Assist to check system stats or make tweaks to your settings. You can ask basic questions like, \"How does DLSS Frame Generation work?\" but it also has control over some system-level settings.</p>\n<p>By calling up G-Assist, you can get a rundown of how your system is running, including custom data charts created on the fly by G-Assist. You can also ask the AI to tweak your machine, for example, optimizing the settings for a particular game or toggling on or off a setting. G-Assist can even overclock your GPU if you so choose, complete with a graph of expected performance gains.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/no-cloud-needed-nvidia-creates-gaming-centric-ai-chatbot-that-runs-on-your-gpu/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/no-cloud-needed-nvidia-creates-gaming-centric-ai-chatbot-that-runs-on-your-gpu/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f75e8c373a3d63079986176626c8ea01878083b99e840cb8955048d372de99e6","category":"Tech"}
