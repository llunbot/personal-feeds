Apple introduced a new entry-level 14-inch model to replace the ancient 13-inch model and brought a load of upgrades: a far superior display, newer design, faster chip, and a better camera and speakers. However, there’s one sticking point: It still starts at 8GB of RAM even with a significantly higher $1,599 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people have argued that Windows laptops in a similar price range all have at least 16GB and in many cases 32GB of RAM. However, in a recent interview, Apple’s VP of worldwide product marketing, Bob Borchers, claimed the comparison wasn’t fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As spotted by MacRumors, Bochers was asked about the 8GB in the entry-level MacBook Pro in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16M411Q7BG/&amp;xcust=1-1-2130974-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with Lin YiLYi</a> on the Chinese-language video-sharing site Bilibili and he defended Apple’s decision: “8GB on an M3 MacBook Pro is probably analogous to 16GB on other systems. We just happen to be able to use it much more efficiently.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it switched to Apple silicon in the Mac, Apple introduced a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234843/m1-macs-memory-isnt-what-it-used-to-be.html\">unified memory system</a> that integrates the RAM into the processor and can quickly allocate it to different parts of the system. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120691/m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-specs-features-cpu-gpu.html\">M3 chip introduces Dynamic Caching</a>, which Apple claims “dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Borchers continues, “This is the place where I think people need to see beyond the specs, and actually go and look beyond the capabilities, and listen to trusted people like you who have actually used the systems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has used the systems, I can report that 8GB is still probably too low for most people. Even if you’re not using high-end apps, Safari and Photoshop can use several gigs of RAM. But perhaps more importantly, if you’re buying a Pro machine, you should get more RAM than someone buying a MacBook Air.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d05a51098391a0299c3749714ce35a59aa8a162da1745a037a2c701b6033759c","category":"Apple"}
