The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff \nWilliams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the \neffort, according to the people. </p>\n\n<p>The two executives told staffers that the project will begin \nwinding down and that many employees on the car team — known as \nthe Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the \nartificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. \nThose employees will focus on generative AI projects, an \nincreasingly key priority for the company. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kevin Lynch took over leadership of Project Titan <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/kevin-lynch-apple-car-project/\">back in September 2021</a>, but  remained in charge of Apple Watch, too. In hindsight that makes me wonder if Lynch’s mission wasn’t to ship a car, but more to assess what technologies the group had created could be used to create other products. Whatever progress Apple has made with “autonomy” ought to be applicable to robots, for example. Making intelligent robots feels more like something Apple should be doing than making cars.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The move came as a relief to investors, who sent Apple shares \nclimbing Tuesday after Bloomberg reported the news. The stock was \nup about 1% at $182.63 by the close in New York. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or, maybe, investors didn’t care at all, and popular stocks typically move up or down by a percentage point or so every single day. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg\">But Bloomberg is going to Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/27/apple-is-canceling-electric-car-project\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"af142e99ae4b71b8becd19fda8a0ec09bd03dcba94ed65e04bdaf9e2c6ab0603","category":"Tech"}
