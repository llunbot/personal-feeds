Spotify doesn't state when a fix could be coming or whether it would be an app update or other troubleshooting steps. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers reporting the issue on the thread state that Spotify is listed as a consumer of battery life due to background activity, with no clear reason why. While most of the reports are from users running iOS 14.8 and iOS 15.0, there are also other sporadic reports of battery drainage on older iOS versions. Those users are advised to update for a possible patch and improved security. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Spotify is being held as the main culprit for the excessive drainage, it could also be a bug in ‌iOS 15‌ for some users. ‌iOS 15‌ has been littered with multiple bugs, including one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/26/apple-to-fix-iphone-13-unlock-with-apple-watch/\">limiting Apple Watch functionality</a> with the just-released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, issues with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, and other bugs that Apple has promised fixes for. Apple may be planning to release iOS 15.0.1 as soon as this week to patch those issues and others. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/spotify-ios-15-battery-drain-fix-soon/\">Spotify Acknowledges Battery Drain Issues on iOS 14.8 and iOS 15, Promises Fix Soon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-acknowledges-battery-drain-issues-on-ios-14-8-and-ios-15-promises-fix-soon.2313891/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I_hThHsLsFY:YGpbkb956PY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I_hThHsLsFY:YGpbkb956PY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/I_hThHsLsFY\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e63a1d90be9c7287da9c3ef5b9d1537fd650e08fd9502a4a7d6ef4f43b00c620","category":"Apple"}
