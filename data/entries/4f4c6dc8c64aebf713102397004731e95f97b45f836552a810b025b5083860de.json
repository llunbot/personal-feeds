{"title":"Pixar Lays Off 175 Employees, 14 Percent of Staff, Shocking No One Who’s Tried Watching Their Recent Films","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pixar-layoffs-underway-175-jobs-162130943.html?guccounter=1","date":1716337827000,"content":"\n<p>Samantha Masunaga, reporting for the LA Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walt Disney Co.-owned computer animation studio Pixar is laying\noff 14% of its staff, as it cuts back on the number of streaming\nseries it produces. The layoffs, which will affect about 175\nemployees, were signaled as far back as January. [...]</p>\n\n<p>But Emeryville, Calif.-based Pixar, in particular, has also\nstruggled to break out of a pandemic-induced slump at the box\noffice. While the storied studio known for “Toy Story,” “Finding\nNemo” and “Up” once churned out hit after hit, its recent\nperformance has been mediocre.</p>\n\n<p>Animated films such as “Toy Story” spinoff “Lightyear,” released\nin 2022, was a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-06-20/why-lightyear-disappointed-at-the-box-office-for-disney-and-pixar\">disappointment at the box office</a>, as was\n2020’s “Onward.” Last year’s “Elemental” opened with weak ticket\nsales but managed to recover thanks to strong word-of-mouth\nreviews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After Lee Unkrich’s <em>Coco</em> (2017), Brad Bird’s <em>The Incredibles 2</em> (2018), and Josh Cooley’s <em>Toy Story 4</em> (2019), I couldn’t name a Pixar film off the top of my head. After a few duds I stopped watching new Pixar movies automatically and waited for ones that were well-regarded. And I’m still waiting.</p>\n\n<p>The core “Pixar braintrust” is gone — Steve Jobs is dead, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ranft\">Joe Ranft</a> is dead, Ed Catmull retired, and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/he-who-not-be-named-can-john-lasseter-ever-return-disney-1105297/\">John Lasseter was driven out</a> of the company by scandal. <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/lee-unkrich-director-of-coco-and-toy-story-3-to-leave-pixar-after-25-years/\">Unkrich left Pixar in 2019</a>. Stanton is <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/person/7-andrew-stanton\">still listed as creative vice president</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004056/\">his most recent</a> Pixar movie was co-writing <em>Toy Story 4</em>. Of the braintrust, only Pete Docter — now Pixar’s chief creative officer, and the director of <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, <em>Up</em>, and <em>Inside Out</em> — remains. Stanton has directed a lot of live action episodic content since <em>Toy Story 4</em>, including <em>Obi Wan</em> for Disney, <em>Better Call Saul</em>, <em>For All Mankind</em>, and the only good episode of Netflix’s <em>3 Body Problem</em>. His next two projects are live action films, <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6348388/?ref_=nm_flmg_unrel_1_dr\">Revolver</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/andrew-stanton-to-direct-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-movie-1235235733/\">In the Blink of an Eye</a></em>. Brad Bird is directing a cool-sounding “retro-futuristic detective story” <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/ray-gunn-brad-bird-skydance-animation/\">titled <em>Ray Gunn</em></a>, with Lasseter producing, but that’s for Skydance Animation, not Pixar.</p>\n\n<p>There’s just nothing special about Pixar any more. Excellence is fragile, and genius talent is rare.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/21/pixar-layoffs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4f4c6dc8c64aebf713102397004731e95f97b45f836552a810b025b5083860de","category":"Tech"}
