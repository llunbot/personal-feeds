Alexa is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/\">Amazon's biggest money-loser</a>, Apple's Siri is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/report-describes-apples-organizational-dysfunction-and-lack-of-ambition-in-ai/\">mired in organizational dysfunction and cautiousness</a>, and Google is leaning hard into <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-assistant-might-be-doomed-division-reorganizes-to-focus-on-bard/\">every kind of AI except its own Assistant</a>. The open source, privacy-minded Home Assistant, with perfect timing, aims to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/with-voice-assistants-in-trouble-home-assistant-starts-a-local-alternative/\">step into the void with a local-only voice assistant</a>.</p>\n<p></p><div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/esp32_s3_box.png\"><img alt=\"An ESP-32-BOX device from Espressif.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/esp32_s3_box-300x300.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/esp32_s3_box-640x641.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/esp32_s3_box.png\">An ESP-32-BOX device from Espressif.</a> (credit: Espressif)</p></div>There's one big problem: Home Assistant doesn't yet offer any hardware you can buy and put on your kitchen counter. That's the gap a curious new project, <a href=\"https://github.com/toverainc/willow\">Willow</a>, aims to fill. It's a project to utilize a specific set of hardware: <a href=\"https://github.com/espressif/esp-box\">ESP-32-BOX</a> devices, which provide a basic hardware shell around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32\">ESP32 SoCs</a>. Once flashed with Willow, they can work as locally controlled voice assistants and, eventually, great and easy access points for Home Assistant.\n<p>They're not going to win design awards, but they look a lot nicer on a kitchen counter or desktop than a bare Raspberry Pi with <a href=\"https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-audio-hats\">a microphone HAT on</a>, or repurposed gaming or teleconference hardware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939388#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939388&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d4ffae3ca7a78e915474779d4f0ec1f73dd865fa10e7e310821e769950c92725","category":"Tech"}
