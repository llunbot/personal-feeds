Only 31 percent of those eligible claimed the first payment, leaving money for a second payment. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple paid $95 million to settle the lawsuit, the company admitted no wrongdoing and has denied that refurbished devices are inferior to new devices.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-refurbished-lawsuit-payments-january-2024/\">Second Payment Emails for Refurbished Apple Device Class Action Lawsuit Going Out Tomorrow</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/second-payment-emails-for-refurbished-apple-device-class-action-lawsuit-going-out-tomorrow.2415789/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5401708c1b57f82c4872408bd15eebd0727bf26bf23252bdc26f2cba4f27ef8f","category":"Apple"}
