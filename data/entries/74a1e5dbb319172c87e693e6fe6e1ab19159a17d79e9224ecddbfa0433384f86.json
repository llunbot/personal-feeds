These coding labs will allow developers to test and optimize their apps on visionOS, and Apple employees will be available to help with setup and troubleshooting.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple has since started emailing the first developers invited to attend these labs, which will begin next week and continue into August in the chosen cities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Cupertino on Monday! <a href=\"https://t.co/jmwcudDj4r\">pic.twitter.com/jmwcudDj4r</a></p>— Adam Watters (@AdamWatters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamWatters/status/1684671118978998272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 27, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\"In these self-directed coding and design labs, you'll be able to test and optimize your apps on visionOS,\" Apple's website says. \"Bring your Mac, code, and everything you need to modify, build, run, and test your app on Vision Pro.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Developer Program members who are at least 18 years old can apply to attend one of the labs. Developers must have a new visionOS app in active development, or an existing iPadOS or iOS app, and Apple says priority will be given to developers who are building apps that are specially optimized for the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Top-Secret Rules</h2>\r<br />\nApple has made an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/apple-vision-pro-sdk/\">SDK and visionOS simulator</a> available for developers to build Vision Pro apps. For developers who need continuous, direct access to the headset, Apple has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-now-available/\">opened applications for Vision Pro developer kits</a>. Apple has very strict <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/visionos/developer-kit/apply/static/policy/vision-pro-developer-kit-program-terms.pdf\">terms and conditions</a> for these kits, which developers must keep secure at all times.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>The Vision Pro developer kit rules are INSANE <a href=\"https://t.co/0mEzAEWzfu\">pic.twitter.com/0mEzAEWzfu</a></p>—  (@DylanMcD8) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DylanMcD8/status/1683528096165576713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nDevelopers must keep the kit in a \"private, secure workspace,\" and cannot show it to any family, friends, or other unauthorized individuals, according to Apple. The kit also must be in a developer's \"direct line of sight\" at all times, and stored in a locked Pelican case in a locked space when not in use, the company adds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the Vision Pro will launch in the U.S. early next year, and third-party visionOS apps will be available through the App Store on the headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613\">@aaronp613</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/28/vision-pro-developer-lab-invites/\">Apple Invites Developers to Vision Pro Coding Labs, Reveals Top-Secret Rules for Tester Kits</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-invites-developers-to-vision-pro-coding-labs-reveals-top-secret-rules-for-tester-kits.2397154/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"74a1e5dbb319172c87e693e6fe6e1ab19159a17d79e9224ecddbfa0433384f86","category":"Apple"}
