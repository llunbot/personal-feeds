{"title":"The Updated Aventon Pace 500.3: an Electric Cruiser for Casual Adventures","link":"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-pace-500-3/","date":1680015600000,"content":"<p>The enterprising folks at Aventon are building <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-abound-cargo-ebike-release/\" target=\"_blank\">new eBikes</a> almost <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-aventure-2-fat-e-bike-launch/\" target=\"_blank\">faster than we can write about them</a>. Today’s release is the Pace 500.3, an update to Aventon’s cruiser that builds on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-pace-350-500-e-bike-casual-bicycle/\" target=\"_blank\">previous revamps</a> by adding a torque sensor and four new assist modes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last revision occurred in March 2022 and added a frame-integrated battery, rear brake lights, and a headlight, among other features. For this update, Aventon tweaked the battery yet again, claiming the Pace 500.3 now has a range of up to 60 miles. The other major update is the torque sensor, a modification Aventon says makes the Pace 500.3 <a href=\"https://www.aventon.com/blogs/aventon_bikes/torque-sensor-vs-cadence-sensor-on-electric-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">more “intuitive.”</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"A green Pace 500.3 against a white background\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The step-over version of the Pace 500.3 in Camoflauge </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Pace 500.3 gives riders full control over the way they cruise. It’s the same great Pace with newer technologies…it’s leisurely riding with a lift,” the brand wrote in a press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When paired with the four new pedal-assist modes (Eco, Tour, Sport, and Turbo), Aventon says the Pace 500.3 can get you up to 28 miles per hour — plenty fast enough for cruising!  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-800x450.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aventon-cruiser-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Swept back handlebars and a color screen that syncs with your phone.
