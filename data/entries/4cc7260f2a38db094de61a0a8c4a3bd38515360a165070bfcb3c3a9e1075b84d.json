{"title":"Daring Fireball T-Shirts and Hoodies","link":"https://store.daringfireball.net/","date":1733979000000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://store.daringfireball.net/\">\n<img src=\"/members/images/2024/hoodie.png\" alt=\"Photo of a Daring Fireball logo hoodie.\" height=\"445\" width=\"445\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>In addition to two choices for t-shirts, the new DF Paraphernalia store also has the above hoodies, which are pretty nice, I have to say. I particularly like the drawstrings, which are much more substantial, almost rope-like, than the shoelace-like strings on most hoodies. I wear mine a lot, especially in the winter, as an extra layer. You’d look good in one.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the thing. The store will not be open year-round. We’re taking orders now, printing to meet demand, and then we’re going to close it down. Order tonight or tomorrow, and if you’re in the U.S., yours should arrive before Christmas. International orders — even those ordered by our good neighbors in Canada — most likely will not.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/11/daring-fireball-shirts-and-hoodies\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4cc7260f2a38db094de61a0a8c4a3bd38515360a165070bfcb3c3a9e1075b84d","category":"Tech"}
