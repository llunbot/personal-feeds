Claude 3.5 can compose text, analyze data, and write code. It features a 200,000 token context window and is available now on the <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude website</a> and through an API. Anthropic also introduced Artifacts, a new feature in the Claude interface that shows related work documents in a dedicated window.</p>\n\n<p>So far, people outside of Anthropic seem impressed. \"This model is really, really good,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/simonw/status/1803819993416466573\">wrote</a> independent AI researcher Simon Willison on X. \"I think this is the new best overall model (and both faster and half the price of Opus, similar to the GPT-4 Turbo to GPT-4o jump).\"</p>\n<p>As we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/\">written before</a>, benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are troublesome because they can be cherry-picked and often do not capture the feel and nuance of using a machine to generate outputs on almost any conceivable topic. But according to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Sonnet matches or outperforms competitor models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on certain benchmarks like <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-task-language-understanding-on-mmlu\">MMLU</a> (undergraduate level knowledge), <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/gsm8k\">GSM8K</a> (grade school math), and <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/humaneval\">HumanEval</a> (coding).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032543#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032543&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c4bdfbce0421548d0678c63e3d0702670b248ac3ef79ab033ea4db0d1108aea4","category":"Tech"}
