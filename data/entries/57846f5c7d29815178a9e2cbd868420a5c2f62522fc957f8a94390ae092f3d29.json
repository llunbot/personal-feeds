People blocked by Safety Mode will be unable to follow your account, see your Tweets, or send Direct Messages.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Introducing Safety Mode. A new way to limit unwelcome interactions on Twitter. <a href=\"https://t.co/xa5Ot2TVhF\">pic.twitter.com/xa5Ot2TVhF</a></p>â€” Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1433099983016759302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nWith Safety Mode, the autoblock stays on for a minimum of seven days, and autoblocked accounts are listed in the Safety Mode interface. Accounts that a person follows will not be autoblocked.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo develop Safety Mode, Twitter consulted trusted partners with expertise in online safety, mental health, and human rights.<blockquote>We want you to enjoy healthy conversations, so this test is one way we're limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations. Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.</blockquote>Twitter is testing Safety Mode with a small group of people at the current time and will expand the testing group as feedback is received. During the beta testing period, Twitter says it will incorporate improvements and adjustments before releasing the feature for all users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/twitter-debuts-safety-mode/\">Twitter Debuts New 'Safety Mode' for Automatically Blocking Unwanted Replies</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-debuts-new-safety-mode-for-automatically-blocking-unwanted-replies.2309443/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YdVwg5x1fcM:CzXztHKQcdw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YdVwg5x1fcM:CzXztHKQcdw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YdVwg5x1fcM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57846f5c7d29815178a9e2cbd868420a5c2f62522fc957f8a94390ae092f3d29","category":"Apple"}
