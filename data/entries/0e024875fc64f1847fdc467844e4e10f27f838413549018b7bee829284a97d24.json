The company is shutting down the all-in-one subscription service that let customers pay a monthly fee for a new Pixel Phone and a bunch of Google subscription services like YouTube Premium. When the service launched in October 2021, Google said that every two years on the Pixel Pass would make you eligible for a brand new phone. But the service only lasted 22 months, so no one will be eligible for that phone upgrade.</p>\n<p></p><aside>\n  <h2>Google kills product</h2>\n\t<ul>\n\t    <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/google-kills-two-year-pixel-pass-subscription-after-just-22-months/\">Google kills two-year “Pixel Pass” subscription after just 22 months</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/waymo-kills-off-autonomous-trucking-program/\">Waymo kills off autonomous trucking program</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/google-assistant-kills-off-support-for-third-party-note-apps/\">Google Assistant kills off support for third-party note apps</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/youtube-is-killing-off-youtube-stories-its-snapchat-clone/\">YouTube Stories, Google’s clone of Snapchat, is dying on June 26</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/google-is-bricking-dropcams-and-nest-secure-offers-discounts-to-upgraders/\">RIP to Dropcams, Nest Secure: Google is shutting down servers next year</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  <span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/\">View more stories</a></span>\n</aside>\nPixel Pass <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/\">was introduced</a> alongside the Pixel 6 launch. For $45 per month, you would get a new Pixel 6, YouTube and YouTube Music Premium, 200GB of Google One storage, \"Preferred Care\" coverage for your phone, and a \"Google Play Pass,\" a Netflix-style all-you-can-eat subscription for Play Store apps and games. Google said you could \"save up to $294 over two years\" compared to buying everything individually. A more expensive $55-per-month plan got you a Pixel 6 Pro instead, and there were even plans that included Google Fi Wireless cellular service.<p></p>\n<p>Google explained its latest product shutdown on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelpass/answer/13968577#zippy=%2Cwhy-is-pixel-pass-being-discontinued\">a support page</a>. \"Beginning August 29, 2023, Pixel Pass is no longer offered for new Pixel purchases or renewal,\" the company said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964271#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964271&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e024875fc64f1847fdc467844e4e10f27f838413549018b7bee829284a97d24","category":"Tech"}
