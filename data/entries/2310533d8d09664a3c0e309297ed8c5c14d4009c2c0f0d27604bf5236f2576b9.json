Well, your search can be a little easier with Twelve South’s new PlugBug multi-port wall charger. This charger stands out in a crowded marketplace because the PlugBug is equipped with Find My, Apple’s tool for tracking compatible gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of frantically checking each wall socket in your house or trying to remember if you left your charger at the office or the coffee shop, you can just launch Find My, and bingo! There’s your PlugBug, which has a built-in speaker so you can use the Play Sound feature in Find My to help locate the device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, the PlugBug doesn’t have to be plugged into power for Find My to work. According to the <a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug-multiport-usbc-charger-with-find-my\">PlugBug</a> website, “the Find My portion of PlugBug is completely separate and isolated from the AC charger.” It has a replaceable battery like the one used for <a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug-multiport-usbc-charger-with-find-my\">AirTag</a> and should last for a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>Twelve South offers two versions of the PlugBug:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>50W with two USB-C ports for $70/£61 (measures 3.3 by 1.93 by 0.86 inches/8.3 by 4.9 by 2.2 centimeters and weighs 3.9 ounces/110 grams)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>120W with four USB-C ports for $120/£104 (measures 4.1 by 2.36 by 1.22 inches//10.4 by 6.0 by 3.1 centimeters and weighs 8.8 ounces/250 grams)</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The chargers support dynamic Power Delivery, so you can plug in your device to any of the ports and the charger will adjust the wattage accordingly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PlugBug is available for pre-order in the <a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug-multiport-usbc-charger-with-find-my\">U.S.</a> and <a href=\"https://twelvesouth.co.uk/products/plugbug-with-find-my\">U.K.</a> with shipments starting the week of September 16—just in time for your new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>PlugBug with Find My</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PlugBug with Find My\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/plugbug.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50W for $69.99; 120W for $119.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug-multiport-usbc-charger-with-find-my\" target=\"_blank\">$70 at  Twelve South</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2310533d8d09664a3c0e309297ed8c5c14d4009c2c0f0d27604bf5236f2576b9","category":"Apple"}
