These features require the latest AirPods Pro 2 model and a device running iOS 18.1 or iPadOS 18.1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe regional restriction likely stems from regulatory requirements â€“ Apple has obtained FDA authorization in the United States to market AirPods Pro 2 as \"clinical grade\" hearing aids. Similar approvals from health regulators in other countries may be necessary before Apple can expand the features' availability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new hearing health functions allow AirPods Pro 2 owners to take hearing tests directly through their iPhone, with results stored in the Health app. For users who show signs of hearing loss, the AirPods can function as genuine hearing aids, boosting specific frequencies in real-time. The update also introduces advanced hearing protection features that automatically reduce exposure to loud environmental sounds.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/18-new-things-your-iphone-can-do-ios-18-1/\">18 New Things Your iPhone Can Do in iOS 18.1</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple has not announced a timeline for when these features might become available in additional regions.
