(Which is, of course, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, we're sure. Or maybe <em>Rogue One</em>? We can be confident it isn't <em>Attack of the Clones</em> or <em>Rise of Skywalker</em>, at any rate.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932300#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932300&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chuong Nguyen","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"373473855a8c9846b10058cd679db71f04c610cd73501e01357bf3e1085c6269","category":"Tech"}
