From there, scroll down and tap the \"+\" button next to the \"Music Recognition\" option that has the Shazam logo. Once added, users can access the Control Center and tap on the icon with the Shazam logo to identify a song that's playing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is improving Music Recognition in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and going forward, it will automatically save a list of songs that users have discovered through the Control Center feature. The Music Recognition history can be viewed by long pressing on the Shazam Control Center icon on a device running ‌iOS 15‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDevelopers are also now able to take advantage of a ShazamKit API that allows Shazam's audio recognition technology to be integrated directly into apps, and the first apps with this functionality will launch this fall. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shazam/\">Shazam</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/shazam-music-recognition-milestone/\">Apple's Shazam Control Center Music Recognition Feature Hits 1 Billion Songs Identified</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-shazam-control-center-music-recognition-feature-hits-1-billion-songs-identified.2310557/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XBPFfP8V-CY:9mYdY34JPcA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XBPFfP8V-CY:9mYdY34JPcA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XBPFfP8V-CY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e1e1d37f0550b784c6cd34b5b592c66fc674331c1823fd925b513c5a93d7d06","category":"Apple"}
