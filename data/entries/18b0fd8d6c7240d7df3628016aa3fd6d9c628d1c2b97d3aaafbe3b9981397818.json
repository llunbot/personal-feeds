They are reliable and a solid performer, as you would expect from a Shimano product carrying the 105 name.</p>\n<p>At this level, all Shimano SPD-SL pedals share the same body design, so you get many of the benefits of Shimano’s higher-tier Ultegra and Dura-Ace designs.</p>\n<p>One of these benefits is the wide body with stainless steel inserts. Together, these deliver a very secure and solid base for pedalling and excellent power transfer.</p>\n<p>The pedals use Shimano’s three-bolt cleat. They are available in three versions, offering different levels of float; these pedals are supplied with Shimano’s yellow cleats with 6 degrees of float.</p>\n<p>The release tension can be adjusted with an Allen key and the pedals hang at a nice angle for easy clipping in.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-105-r7000-pedals-review/\">Read our full Shimano 105 R7000 pedals review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Time Xpresso 2 pedals</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Time Xpresso 2 pedals for road cycling\" title=\"Time Xpresso 2 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Time Xpresso 2 pedals are an affordable option and feature the company’s unique composite blade technology.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£50/$65 as tested</li>\n<li>Easy to use</li>\n<li>Large stable platform with smooth float</li>\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n</ul><p>The Xpresso 2 pedals bring Time’s unique blade design to a more affordable price point.</p>\n<p>At 315g (with cleats), the lightweight design and ease of use mean these pedals will appeal to a wide range of cyclists – especially as a first set of clipless pedals.</p>\n<p>The pedals are constructed from a steel axle with a composite body.

Clipless (i.e clip-in) pedals evolved out of the old pedal and toe-clip setup that pretty much every road bike had until the late 80s/early 90s. Although you do ‘clip in’ to clipless pedals, they get their name from the absence of that traditional toe-clip.</p>\n<p>While toe-clips rely on a clip and strap to hold the foot on the pedal, clipless pedals use a cleat that’s fastened to the sole of the shoe and engages with the pedal mechanically, similar to a ski binding.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Velo Orange pedal with traditional leather toe clips\" title=\"Velo Orange pedal with traditional leather toe clips\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pedals used to employ clips and straps to hold your feet in place.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Velo Orange</i></span></div>\n<p>To clip into pedals, you step on the pedal’s face and push your foot forwards or downwards to engage the cleat.

There are various reasons you might choose a smaller two-bolt cleat over a three-point fastening cleat. You can find out which would be best for you in our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">Shimano SPD and SPD-SL explainer</a>.</p>\n<p>Speedplay is the notable exception, with its four-bolt pattern (but then the US company effectively reverses the entire system by mounting the clip mechanism onto your shoes, leaving the pedals to act as the cleats).</p>\n<p>To use these, you’ll need four-bolt shoes or the adaptor, which is included with every set of Speedplay pedals.</p>\n<p>We have a guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-install-and-adjust-cycling-cleats/\">how to fit and adjust cycling cleats</a> if you are new to riding with clipless pedals or just need a refresh.</p>\n<p>We also have a guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/when-should-you-replace-cleats/\">when to replace your cycling cleats</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Float</strong></h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Close up of foot clipping into pedal.\" title=\"how-to-change-a-cleat-20221130_86\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Float refers to how much lateral movement a cleat and pedal allow before unclipping.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Float is measured in degrees and refers to the amount your foot can move before it’s released from the pedal.</p>\n<p>It’s there to allow your feet to fall into the most natural, comfortable position while pedalling and to reduce the stress on your knees if your cleats aren’t positioned perfectly.</p>\n<p>Some cleats are ‘zero-float’, or fixed, which means they release your foot with only the slightest of movements. They need to be set up very carefully for the sake of your knees. Most cleats, however, offer something in the range of 3 to 9 degrees of float.</p>\n<p>The thing to bear in mind is the more float you have, the further you have to twist your foot in order to release it.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure about how much float you need, don’t worry, your pedal choice won’t lock you into one particular setting. You can experiment by running different cleats and adjusting the settings on your pedals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Release tension</strong></h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Take the time to get your cleats in the right position\" title=\"new-years-rev-05-1487681548474-136y47kb4l85v-c332300\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Release tension is the amount of force it takes to disengage your foot from the pedal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jesse Wild</i></span></div>\n<p>Most pedals enable you to adjust the pedals’ release tension – the amount of force required to disengage your foot from the mechanism. If you’re a beginner, start off with a low tension for easier release.</p>\n<p>This will also make it easier to clip into the pedal. As you become more confident riding with clipless pedals, you can increase the tension for a more secure connection between you and your bike.</p>\n<h3><strong>Stack height</strong></h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist in blue top riding the Scott Foil 10 road bike\" title=\"Scott Foil 10 04\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lower the stack height, the greater your efficiency, in theory.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This is measured from the middle of the pedal axle to the sole of the shoe. The lower the stack height the better because it places your foot closer to the axle for the best possible efficiency.</p>\n<p>You may need to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-get-your-bike-saddle-height-right/\">adjust your saddle height</a> if you change pedals, because every model has a slightly different stack height.</p>\n<h3>Q-factor</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" title=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley as spotted at the Tour de France\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Professional cyclist Caleb Ewan uses pedal extenders to increase the Q-factor of his Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 crankset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Q-Factor is the lateral distance between the edges of your two crank arms, but it is most often used to mean <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stance-width-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/\">stance width</a>, or the distance between your feet when pedalling.</p>\n<p>Establishing the correct Q-Factor for you can be tricky, but if you know you need to increase your Q-Factor one way to do this is to change your pedals for ones with longer spindles.</p>\n<p>Shimano Dura-Ace and Ultegra pedals are available with longer spindles.
