It can emulate, read, and copy RFID and NFC tags, digital access keys, remotes, and more. Its capabilities allow it to unlock cars, skim RFID chips, and do other nefarious things, such as spamming iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRunning third-party firmware from Xtreme, the Flipper Zero was able to use a BLE Spam app to create a huge number of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> Keyboard popups on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, causing the device to lock up. As <em>ZDNET</em> puts it, Flipper Zero was able to perform a denial of service (DoS) attack on all iPhones in a 30-foot radius of the attacker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRestarting the ‌iPhone‌ was able to fix the issue, but it was still an annoyance. Following the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-features/\">iOS 17.2 update</a>, <em>ZDNET</em> found that an ‌iPhone‌ running the software was not able to be exploited by the Xtreme firmware. Popups still appear, but not a deluge of popups capable of disabling an ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2 was released earlier this week and is recommended for all devices capable of running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>. It includes the Journal app <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-features/\">and multiple new features</a> for Messages, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, Weather, and other apps.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-flipper-zero-bug-fix/\">Apple Fixes Bug Allowing Flipper Zero to Lock Up iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fixes-bug-allowing-flipper-zero-to-lock-up-iphones.2413854/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"be452b21ec83283d715e36f64024c6729da0a380f0d67c0712220a9533cc963b","category":"Apple"}
