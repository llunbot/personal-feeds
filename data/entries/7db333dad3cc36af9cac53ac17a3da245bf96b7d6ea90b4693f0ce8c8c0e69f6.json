Power plus dirt. Yet, the stigmas still exist that steel is heavy. High-end steel bikes cost less than high-end carbon bikes, and offer a more forgiving chassis material. 1″ threaded steel fork, flex nicely over corrugations, eliminating the need for expensive (and heavy) suspension forks or other quirky damping devices. These new Rene Herse Ultimate headsets use needle bearings and a unique locking mechanism to keep them in proper engagement, no matter how rough the terrain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/ParagonMachineWorksRadavist-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/ParagonMachineWorksRadavist-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/ParagonMachineWorksRadavist-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/ParagonMachineWorksRadavist-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1985-Steve-Potts-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1985-Steve-Potts-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1985-Steve-Potts-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1985-Steve-Potts-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>What Rene Herse is touching on is intriguing. John has five bikes with 1″ threaded headsets, Crust Bikes has countless <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crust-noreaster-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">1″ threaded headset models</a>, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/paragon-machine-works-32-mm-headset-wrenches/\" target=\"_blank\">we made a titanium 1″ headset wrench</a>, Wilde just <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wilde-x-cane-creek-110-zn-1-threadless-headset/\" target=\"_blank\">re-issued the Cane Creek 1″ headset</a>, and yes, Rivendell never left the 1″ threaded headset behind. Hell, John’s “racing” (more like surviving) with Miguel this year on a rim brake, 1″ threaded headset bike. Are we staring down a 1″ threaded headset revival?</p>\n<p>Read the full blog post at <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/introducing-the-ultimate-headset/\" target=\"_blank\">Rene Herse</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rene-herse-ultimate-headsets/\">Rene Herse Ultimate 1″ Threaded Headsets</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7db333dad3cc36af9cac53ac17a3da245bf96b7d6ea90b4693f0ce8c8c0e69f6","category":"Cycling"}
