[credit:\n                              Rakuten Kobo                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Rakuten is updating its pen-compatible Elipsa e-reader to make it more competitive with e-reader-turned-notepads like the reMarkable 2 and the Kindle Scribe. The new Kobo Elipsa 2E is a 10.3-inch e-reader with a pen that can be used to take notes, annotate documents, and make notes in books you're reading. The device <a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-elipsa-2E\">can be preordered now</a> and will start shipping on April 19.</p>\n\n<p>The Elipsa 2E shares a few things in common with Amazon's Kindle Scribe hardware, including a large asymmetrical side bezel, a warm screen light that can reduce eyestrain in the evenings, Bluetooth support for listening to audiobooks, and a USB-C port. Its 227 PPI screen isn't as sharp as the Scribe's 300 PPI screen, but it's the same density as the screen included in <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/\">the reMarkable 2</a>. The Elipsa also weighs a little less than the Scribe (0.88 pounds, down from 0.96), though they're close enough that holding the two tablets should feel similar.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"The Kobo Elipsa 2E's pen accessory.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kobo-pen.jpeg\" /><p>The Kobo Elipsa 2E's pen accessory. (credit: Rakuten Kobo)</p></div>\n<p>The Elipsa's $400 price tag is OK for what you get. The Scribe starts at $340, but that gets you a less-capable Basic Pen and just 16GB of storage; stepping up to the 32GB Scribe and the Premium Pen raises the price to $390, a lot closer to the Elipsa. Kobo doesn't offer other storage capacities or alternate pens, though it will sell you a case for an extra $70. The Elipsa does have features that the Scribe doesn't offer, though, including a \"lasso\" tool for quickly grabbing and moving things you've written or drawn and integration with Dropbox and (\"coming soon\") Google Drive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929420#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929420&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb8615576c23a1ecb58bd63da8263b8b6a0cdc6475f4fb313aeae1bf306d132e","category":"Tech"}
