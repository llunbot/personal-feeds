Last night at the ACT Expo trade show, the company debuted a new variant, called the VNL Autonomous. The name should give it away—this truck has been designed to drive itself using autonomous tech from the startup Aurora.</p>\n<p>The VNL Autonomous has been designed for SAE level 4 autonomy and combines long-range lidar with radar, cameras, and other sensors. Input from these sensors is processed by a redundant pair of computers running Aurora's AI software. Aurora has been a partner with Volvo Autonomous Solutions for some years now, working on hub-to-hub driverless freight systems for the North American market.</p>\n<p>\"Our platform engineering approach prioritizes safety by incorporating high-assurance redundancy systems designed to mitigate potential emergency situations,\" said Volvo Autonomous Solutions' chief product officer Shahkh Kazmi. \"We built the Volvo VNL Autonomous from the ground up, integrating these redundancy systems to ensure that every safety-critical component is intentionally duplicated, thereby significantly enhancing both safety and reliability.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025836#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025836&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
