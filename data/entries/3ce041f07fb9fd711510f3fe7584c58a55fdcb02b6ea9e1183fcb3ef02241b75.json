He believes that progress on the new machines indicates that they are likely to launch between early 2024 and the spring, which would mirror the approximate time frame in which the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Pro and ‌M2‌ Max MacBook Pro models launched earlier this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew 13- and 15-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> models with the M3 chip have also apparently reached engineering verification testing (EVT), an earlier production testing phase on prototype devices. Gurman says this puts the next-generation MacBook Airs on schedule for launch between the spring and summer of next year at the earliest, which could also mirror the time frame of the current models' launches that took place at WWDC in June 2022 and 2023.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/\">Four New MacBooks on Schedule for Launch in 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024.2407722/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3ce041f07fb9fd711510f3fe7584c58a55fdcb02b6ea9e1183fcb3ef02241b75","category":"Apple"}
