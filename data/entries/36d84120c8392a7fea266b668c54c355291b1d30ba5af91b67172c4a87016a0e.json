The bike was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">spotted at the 2023 Tour de France</a> and Critérium du Dauphiné, with the collaboration with Formula 1 engineering consultancy Red Bull Advanced Technologies evident from that company’s logo on the bike’s down tube. We’ve now got further details of the new bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for the four-model BMC Teammachine R range start at €8,999 with Shimano Ultegra and head up to €14,999 for a SRAM Red AXS-equipped bike. There’s also a frameset module, priced at €5,999.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

Teammachine R – R standing for Race – has been developed in collaboration with the Red Bull Advanced Technologies engineering consultancy, applying its Formula 1 expertise to the new

wind-tunnel testing to develop the new bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eagle-eyed will note significant technology spill-over from the BMC Speedmachine triathlon/<a

the shape of the fork, which juts out at an angle at the crown, making for a notably wide fork. BMC says that this design reduces interference between the fork and the spinning front wheel. It claims this design ‘allows the turbulent air to be shuttered away from the frame, reducing aero stall’ and thereby resulting in ‘cleaner air that hugs the frame longer resulting in significant drag reduction’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dropouts have been hidden to help reduce turbulence, while the bottom bracket shape is also said to lead to cleaner airflow. As we’ve seen on countless BMC bikes before, the bottle cages have been placed and sculpted in such a way that they make the bike more aerodynamically efficient when there are bottles on board. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the flared fork crown, BMC says that it has designed the frame to reduce the bike’s frontal area. The distance between the frame and the rear wheel has also been reduced to help keep airflow from separating from the wheel rim. Since the BMC Speedmachine was developed around 28mm tyres, we’d expect the same to be true of the Teammachine R.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bold claim for the new bike is that the Teammachine R has the most efficient power transfer BMC has ever developed, thanks to the frame’s stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A less tangible benefit derives from Red Bull Advanced Technologies’ expertise in Formula 1 ‘driver feel’, which BMC says translates to an enhanced feeling of how the new bike will react on the road. BMC says such improved predictability in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-bike-geometry-handling\" target=\"_blank\">handling</a> gives the rider increased confidence to ride at speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Change of team sponsorship</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tech at the 2023 Tour de France\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/tour-de-france-bikes-tech-2023-5.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike brands normally provide quotes at launch from the teams using their new bikes.

We already won two races with this bike and are convinced it will help us get more.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absence of comment from AG2R-Citroën is because the team will be switching bike sponsor for the next season to Decathlon’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/the-birth-of-van-rysel-road-bikes-designed-for-performance\" target=\"_blank\">Van Rysel </a>bike brand. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specs and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side-970x651.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side-970x651.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side-1536x1031.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side-750x503.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side-1140x765.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/TEAMMACHINE-R-01-LTD-cbn-wht-wht-side.jpg 1985w\" /><figcaption>BMC</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At launch, the Teammachine R will be available in four builds as well as a frameset module.
