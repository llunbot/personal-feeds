In this case, \"a bug in the Content Validator\" failed to detect \"problematic content data\" in the update responsible for the crashing systems.</p>\n<p>CrowdStrike says it is making changes to its testing and deployment processes to prevent something like this from happening again. The company is specifically including \"additional validation checks to the Content Validator\" and adding more layers of testing to its process.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038917#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038917&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8dbb052d84696fd90bb44e51f05cfd1b60addf0ab0592a5d9c7e6943bbd215c6","category":"Tech"}
