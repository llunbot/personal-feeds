The usual 10 blue links were still there, but you had to scroll past Google's ChatGPT clone to see them. That design choice makes outgoing web links seem like a legacy escape hatch for when the chatbot doesn't work, and Google wants to know why more people haven't opted in to this.</p>\n<p>Barry Schwartz at <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-starts-testing-ai-overviews-from-sge-in-main-google-search-interface-438680\">Search Engine Land</a> reports that Google is going to start pushing SGE out to some users, even if they haven't opted in to the \"Labs experiment.\" A Google spokesperson told the site SGE will be turned on for a \"subset of queries, on a small percentage of search traffic in the US.\" The report says \"Google told us they want to get feedback from searchers who have not opted into SGE specifically. This way they can get feedback and learn how a more general population will find this technology helpful.\"</p>\n<p>Citing his conversation with Google, Schwartz says some users automatically see Chatbot results for queries where Google thinks a chatbot \"can be especially helpful.\" Google will turn on the feature for \"queries that are often more complex or involve questions where it may be helpful to get information from a range of web pages—like 'how do I get marks off painted walls.'\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012427#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012427&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cae01db3aa80da69ff109b21d1f8d01b6f3fd86c08937deca0b1539440ec687c","category":"Tech"}
