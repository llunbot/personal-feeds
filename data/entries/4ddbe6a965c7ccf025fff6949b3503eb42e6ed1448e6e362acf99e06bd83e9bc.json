The problem appears to be affecting various models, including the new iPhone 16 series, as well as older devices dating back to the iPhone 14.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-screen-table.jpg\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nUsers on Reddit have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1fmkws1/iphone_16_touch_unresponsive_issue\">reported</a> unresponsive areas on the screen, resulting in missed taps, ignored swipes, and difficulty scrolling or pressing buttons. This behavior is said to be particularly noticeable when interacting with the virtual keyboard, potentially leading to typing errors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/22/iphone-16-pro-users-experiencing-touchscreen-issues-some-taps-and-swipes-ignored/\">9to5Mac</a></em> was first to highlight the issue. However, while initially it was thought to be exclusive to the iPhone 16 Pro models, additional user reports indicate that the problem is more widespread and likely software-related. The root cause appears to be an overly sensitive touch rejection algorithm in iOS 18, designed to ignore accidental touches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that inadvertent contact with the screen edges can trigger the system to temporarily ignore all new touches, the thinner bezels on the new iPhone 16 models may have exacerbated the problem, making it easier for users to unintentionally trigger the rejection mechanism when gripping their devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue seems to occur only when devices are unlocked and in use. Some users have reported particular problems around the new Camera Control button, although it's unclear if this is directly related or a separate issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA demonstration <a href=\"https://mastodon.tz.is/@khaost/113178459118083650\">posted on Mastodon</a> by user Khaos Tian shows how the problem can be intentionally triggered, providing further evidence that it is software-based. Assuming that is the case, it's likely that Apple can address the problem through a future update, but it has yet to comment on the matter.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ios-18-touchscreen-issues-reported/\">iOS 18 Touchscreen Issues Reported by Some iPhone Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-touchscreen-issues-reported-by-some-iphone-users.2437766/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4ddbe6a965c7ccf025fff6949b3503eb42e6ed1448e6e362acf99e06bd83e9bc","category":"Apple"}
