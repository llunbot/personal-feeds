Cook also visited Mar-a-Lago in December, where he had dinner with Trump.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTech CEOs and tech companies have been lavishing Trump with money and attention since November. Google, Amazon, Meta, Uber, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Coinbase, Toyota, Ford, GM, AT&amp;T, and more made donations to Trump's inauguration fund, and as a result, Trump has raised $200 million.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump has made it clear that he plans to put new tariffs in place, and Cook is likely aiming to avoid them with an exemption. During Trump's first term, Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/18/trump-says-tim-cook-made-good-case-about-tariffs/\">able to skirt tariffs</a> on its the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac, though it had to pay some tariffs for the Apple Watch, AirPods, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>. In 2019, Trump said Cook \"made a good case\" that tariffs would put Apple at a disadvantage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmazon's Jeff Bezos, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla's Elon Musk will also be at the inauguration.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/tim-cook-trump-inauguration/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Will Attend Trump Inauguration</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-will-attend-trump-inauguration.2447479/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"46b2df496d63d6de158613d24e3e7c6abda1ec0f066c4996acd5921a5139ee55","category":"Apple"}
