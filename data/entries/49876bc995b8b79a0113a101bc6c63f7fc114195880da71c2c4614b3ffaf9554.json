Spread across 2,000 square kilometers are thick layers of waterlogged peat, now covered by agriculture. It’s all that is left of what used to be a thriving wetland ecosystem, home to forests of Chinese swamp cypress along with elephants, tigers, crocodiles, and tropical birds. But the peat hides the buried, preserved stumps and roots of cypress trees; some of the largest stumps are almost 2 meters wide, and many have burn marks on their tops.</p>\n<p>“These peat layers are locally known as ‘buried ancient forest,’ because many buried trees appear fresh and most stumps are found still standing,” writes Ning Wang of the Chinese Academy of Scientists, who along with colleagues, authored the recent paper. It turns out that the eerie buried forest is the last echo of the Han army’s invasion during a war about 2,100 years ago.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/an-ancient-battle-has-driven-a-wetland-species-almost-to-extinction/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/an-ancient-battle-has-driven-a-wetland-species-almost-to-extinction/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
