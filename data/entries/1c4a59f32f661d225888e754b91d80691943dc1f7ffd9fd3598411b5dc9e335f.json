Between video game processing and AI, demand for GPUs has never been higher, and chipmakers are rushing to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-chip-shortages-leave-ai-startups-scrambling-for-computing-power/\">bolster supply</a>. In new findings released today, though, researchers are <a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/01/16/leftoverlocals-listening-to-llm-responses-through-leaked-gpu-local-memory/\">highlighting a vulnerability in multiple brands and models of mainstream GPUs</a>—including Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD chips—that could allow an attacker to steal large quantities of data from a GPU’s memory.</p>\n<p>The silicon industry has <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/intel-lab-istare-hack-chips/\">spent years</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/intel-google-cloud-chip-security/\">refining the security</a> of central processing units, or CPUs, so they don’t leak data in memory even when they are built to optimize for speed. However, since GPUs were designed for raw graphics processing power, they haven’t been architected to the same degree with data privacy as a priority. As generative AI and other machine learning applications expand the uses of these chips, though, researchers from New York-based security firm <a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/01/16/leftoverlocals-listening-to-llm-responses-through-leaked-gpu-local-memory/\">Trail of Bits</a> say that vulnerabilities in GPUs are an increasingly urgent concern.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996672#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996672&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1c4a59f32f661d225888e754b91d80691943dc1f7ffd9fd3598411b5dc9e335f","category":"Tech"}
