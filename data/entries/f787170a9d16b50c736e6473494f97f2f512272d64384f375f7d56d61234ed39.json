Cards Against Humanity says it received $15 donations from 150,000 people and used part of that money to buy \"a <a href=\"https://cameron.prodigycad.com/property-detail/173555/2024/gis\">plot</a> of vacant land in Cameron County based upon CAH's promise to 'make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for Trump to build his wall.'\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/\">Cards Against Humanity</a> says it mowed the land \"and maintained it in its natural state, marking the edge of the lot with a fence and a 'No Trespassing' sign.\" But instead of Trump taking over the land, Cards Against Humanity says the parcel was \"interfered with and invaded\" by Musk's space company. The lawsuit includes pictures that, according to Cards Against Humanity, show the land when it was first purchased and after SpaceX construction equipment and materials were placed on the land.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051417#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051417&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f787170a9d16b50c736e6473494f97f2f512272d64384f375f7d56d61234ed39","category":"Tech"}
