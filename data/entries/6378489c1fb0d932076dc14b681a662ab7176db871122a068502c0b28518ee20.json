Affected users see the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s display either stop responding or slow down with touch input, and then the ‌iPhone‌ will restart.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue seems to pop up randomly, and it could also impact devices used in StandBy mode. Some users have seen 10 to 20 crashes per day, while other users have seen fewer restarts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has confirmed that the iOS 18.1 update will fix the restart issue, and it is mentioned in the iOS 18.1 release notes included with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/apple-ios-18-1-release-candidate/\">the release candidate</a> that came out today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.1 also fixes several other bugs, including a Podcasts issue that could cause unplayed episodes to be marked as played, a problem with stuttering or overheating when scrubbing through 4K 60 fps videos in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app, and a bug that could cause digital car keys not to unlock or start a vehicle with passive entry after restoring from a backup or transferring from another ‌iPhone‌.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/ios-18-1-fixes-random-restart-bug-iphone-16/\">iOS 18.1 Fixes Bug Causing iPhone 16 to Randomly Restart</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-1-fixes-bug-causing-iphone-16-to-randomly-restart.2440620/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6378489c1fb0d932076dc14b681a662ab7176db871122a068502c0b28518ee20","category":"Apple"}
