Google's reported mishandling of its biggest round of layoffs ever has employees up in arms, and they're doing everything from walking out on the job to sending angry letters to management.</p>\n<p>First up, European Googlers are just now being laid off due to the January announcement. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-workers-stage-walkout-zurich-office-job-cuts-hit-europe-2023-03-15/\">Reuters</a> reports that more than 200 workers were laid off from the Zurich, Switzerland, branch of the company this week.

Google's layoffs seem driven by a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/waymo-hit-by-second-round-of-layoffs-has-cut-8-percent-of-staff-this-year/\">desire to placate the stock market</a>, though, so it's no surprise that these offers fell on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>Many of the Swiss workers that walked out in protest are members of the IT workers union Syndicom, and a union spokesperson told Reuters, \"Our members at Google Zurich and all employees joining the walkout are showing solidarity with those laid off. They are bothered by the non-transparent nature of the layoffs and are especially disappointed that Google is laying off workers at a time when the company is making billions in profit every year.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924998#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924998&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4716cedb05f0b194ddacf1089c2b97b7d6289aca6ce4f8de6d05740e0f2bed3f","category":"Tech"}
