{"title":"Eric Schmidt apparently bought Relativity Space to put data centers in orbit","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/eric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit/","date":1746193514000,"content":"<p>In the nearly two months since former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/former-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-is-the-new-leader-of-relativity-space/\">acquired Relativity Space</a>, the billionaire has not said much publicly about his plans for the launch company. However, his intentions for Relativity now appear to be increasingly clear: He wants to have the capability to launch a significant amount of computing infrastructure into space.</p>\n<p>We know this because Schmidt appeared before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/HXoXMETZUiE\">during a hearing</a> in April, speaking on the future of AI and US competitiveness. Among the topics raised then was the need for more electricity—both renewable and non-renewable—to power data centers that will facilitate the computing needs for AI development and applications. Schmidt noted that an average nuclear power plant in the United States generates 1 gigawatt of power.</p>\n<p>\"People are planning 10 gigawatt data centers,\" Schmidt said. \"Gives you a sense of how big this crisis is. Many people think that the energy demand for our industry will go from 3 percent to 99 percent of total generation. One of the estimates that I think is most likely is that data centers will require an additional 29 gigawatts of power by 2027, and 67 more gigawatts by 2030. These things are industrial at a scale that I have never seen in my life.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/eric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/eric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"062329d71866f40e82bda3e4085f6190806fdbcd2cc74e9b2dba1c30dc2ad195","category":"Tech"}
