But despite transformative effects on companies’ share prices, generative AI tools powered by large language models (LLMs) still have major drawbacks that have kept them from being as useful as many would like them to be. Retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, aims to fix some of those drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most prominent drawback of LLMs is their <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/\">tendency toward confabulation</a> (also called “hallucination”), which is a creative gap-filling technique AI language models use when they encounter holes in their knowledge that weren’t present in their training data. They generate plausible-sounding text that can veer toward accuracy when the training data is solid but otherwise may just be completely made up.</p>\n<p>Relying on confabulating AI models gets people and companies in trouble, as we’ve covered in the past. In 2023, we saw <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/michael-cohens-lawyer-cited-three-fake-cases-in-possible-ai-fueled-screwup/\">two instances</a> of lawyers citing legal cases, confabulated by AI, that didn’t exist. We’ve covered <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/will-chatgpts-hallucinations-be-allowed-to-ruin-your-life/\">claims against OpenAI</a> in which ChatGPT confabulated and accused innocent people of doing terrible things. In February, we wrote about Air Canada’s customer service chatbot <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/\">inventing a refund policy</a>, and in March, a New York City chatbot was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/nycs-government-chatbot-is-lying-about-city-laws-and-regulations/\">caught confabulating</a> city regulations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028618#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028618&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c4faa08871bded0510f62959892f2227d3f0f541f844dcd1e6f910788074ed6","category":"Tech"}
