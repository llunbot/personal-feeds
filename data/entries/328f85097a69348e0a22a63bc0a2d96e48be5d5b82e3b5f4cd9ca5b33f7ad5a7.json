Summer gloves should balance protection and breathability, while winter gloves should protect your hands from the elements when riding in cold and wet conditions.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a new set of mountain bike gloves, here’s our pick of the bunch, as rated by BikeRadar’s team of expert testers. We’ve covered the best winter mountain bike gloves and the best summer mountain bike gloves, with sections below for each.</p>\n<h2>The best summer mountain bike gloves, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Bluegrass Vapour Lite</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We were impressed by how robust the Vapour Lites are.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sarah Bedford / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £32/€35</li>\n</ul><p>These featherweight gloves are as close to not wearing gloves as possible and are designed to be comfortable for long days on the bike. The palm material doesn’t bunch up, crease or fold when you fingers grip the handlebars and as it’s made from a single piece of material, there aren’t any uncomfortable seams or stitching.</p>\n<p>In testing, they’ve also proven to be tough, remaining free from rips and tears. The stretch-focused fit isn’t too tight to restrict movement and there’s a silicone print claimed to improve grip.</p>\n<p>Our tester liked them so much, he went out and bought a couple of sets.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/gloves/bluegrass-vapour-lite-gloves-review/\">Read our full Bluegrass Vapour Lite review </a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Endura Hummvee Lite II</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endura’s Hummvee Lite II gloves are a great summer option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £20/$21/AU$50</li>\n</ul><p>Endura’s Hummvee Lite gloves deliver plenty of feel through their synthetic leather palm, which is thin but feels more protective than others here. It helps that the accurate cut makes for a snug fit with no bunching when gripping the bar.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the mesh backing, they don’t get overly warm, and that backing (along with the impressive fit) means they’re tight enough to stay nice and secure. Our hands never shifted in the gloves when yanking hard on the bar. The snot wipe covers the back of the thumb. Plus, at their retail price, they’re a bargain.</p>\n<p>Our only qualm is that the finger seams feel quite prominent, but you get used to them.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Troy Lee Designs Ace 2.0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> One of the neatest features is the silky-smooth, stretchy cuff.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £35/$36/AU$70</li>\n</ul><p>If you’re after ‘barely there’ gloves, the Ace 2.0s from Troy Lee Designs should be at the top of the list. They’re light and breathable, but super-secure when you pull at the bar while climbing or throwing the bike around. The thin palm delivers plenty of feel from the grip and, thanks to the well-shaped cut, we didn’t suffer any bunching.</p>\n<p>One of the neatest features is the silky-smooth, stretchy cuff, which wraps around your wrist comfortably and securely, helping to lock the glove onto your hand without it ever feeling overly tight or irritating.</p>\n<p>The only thing stopping them from achieving 5 stars is they’re pricey compared to most, although they do last well.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>100% Celium 2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The thin, perforated palm delivers loads of feedback from the grip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: £25/$28/AU$40</li>\n</ul><p>With a seriously impressive, hand-hugging cut and super-secure feel, the Celium 2s feel great on the bike. Thanks to the taut, stretchy mesh upper and unobtrusive but rock-solid Velcro closure at the cuff, they don’t shift on your hands when you’re working hard on the bike and pulling at the bar.</p>\n<p>The thin, perforated palm delivers loads of feedback from the grip and is really well-shaped so doesn’t bunch up. Pricing is reasonable too.</p>\n<p>The downside to the gloves is we’d prefer less silicone print on the palm because it can get slippery in the wet.

Considering just how solid these are, they’re really well-priced.</p>\n<p>We’d recommend trying before you buy because they’re quite big and the fingers are a little baggy (sizing down helps to prevent this).

The supple synthetic-leather palm is extremely comfortable and tactile, creating a feeling almost like riding without gloves.</p>\n<p>Hands are kept warm in nippy air by the windproof and lightly insulated back/top. The wrist closure is neat and the construction quality appears very good.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given the ‘Windproof’ name, they’re not as warm or grippy when wet as the 100% Briskers. They don’t work with touchscreens, so it’s harder to call your other half to warn them your ride’s running late… again.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Giro Proof</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The insulation provided exceptional warmth.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £80/$85</li>\n</ul><p>Giro’s Proof gloves are immensely warm and waterproof, and are designed for the most adverse winter conditions.
