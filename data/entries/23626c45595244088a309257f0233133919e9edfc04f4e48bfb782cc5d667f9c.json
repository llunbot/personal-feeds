Tracking can happen when your address always appears the same to other devices and people using the same network as you.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThe prior Private Wi-Fi Address setting assigned a different MAC address to a device for each Wi-Fi network it connected to.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRotate Wi-Fi Address, like Private Wi-Fi Address, is separate from the additional Limit IP Address Tracking option that can be turned on for Mail and Safari.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-rotate-wifi-address/\">iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia Add 'Rotate Wi-Fi Address' Option to Cut Down on Tracking</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-macos-sequoia-add-rotate-wi-fi-address-option-to-cut-down-on-tracking.2428755/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23626c45595244088a309257f0233133919e9edfc04f4e48bfb782cc5d667f9c","category":"Apple"}
