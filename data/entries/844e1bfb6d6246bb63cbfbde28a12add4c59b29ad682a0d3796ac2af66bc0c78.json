Apple is reportedly reluctant to implement a display that curves over the side of the ‌iPhone‌ due to concerns about optical distortion and durability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple purportedly wants the bezelless displays to facilitate improved thin film encapsulation (TFE) and under-panel camera (UPC) technology, as well as increase space for components like antennas while reducing interference. Retaining a design with a flat display reportedly enables these improvements, where they would otherwise currently be impossible with a curved display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, this suggests that Apple is currently planning to offer the bezelless OLED display as soon as the ‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro in 2025, since this device is rumored to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/\">first to feature under-display Face ID technology</a>, sitting alongside a hole-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera. Likewise, Apple is likely targeting a release date sometime before its own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/10/microled-iphone-report/\">custom microLED display technology</a> makes its way <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/\">to the iPhone</a>. Apple's first device with a custom microLED display is expected to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">2025 Apple Watch Ultra</a>, with various reports suggesting that the ‌iPhone‌ will be soon to follow in subsequent years. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to reduce the ‌iPhone‌'s bezel over time until there is no bezel at all upon utilizing the next-generation OLED panels from Samsung and LG. This year's ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max models are expected to have the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/17/iphone-15-pro-max-thinnest-bezels-ever/\">thinnest bezels</a> of any smartphone to date at just 1.55mm.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg-display/\">LG Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-asks-suppliers-for-bezelless-iphone/\">Apple Reportedly Asks Suppliers for 'Bezelless' OLED iPhone Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-asks-suppliers-for-bezelless-oled-iphone-displays.2396738/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"844e1bfb6d6246bb63cbfbde28a12add4c59b29ad682a0d3796ac2af66bc0c78","category":"Apple"}
