Yesterday, I experienced a “Cozy\nWWDC,” and it was wonderful!</p>\n\n<p>The event took place in an intimate setting with about 170\ndevelopers. There were no highly produced skits, no jabs at the\ncompetition, no speculative non-existent products designed to make\nthe media and influencers lose their shit, and no media. The\nevent, titled “Envision the Future: Build Great Apps for\nvisionOS,” was held at the Apple Developer Center in Cupertino on\nOctober 2nd.</p>\n\n<p>It focused solely on visionOS and spanned just one day.</p>\n\n<p>The presenters were live. Many wrote code and showed the results\nlive. Sometimes demos didn’t work the first time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have heard from a few other attendees that this was an excellent and very productive little event.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/08/heberlein-cozy-wwdc\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"44b12cb0c3f9c8c4bb3c1dc0f98d35e56ca2aeab418843d605f75925eebde533","category":"Tech"}
