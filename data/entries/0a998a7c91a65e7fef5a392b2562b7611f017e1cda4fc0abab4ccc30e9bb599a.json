All of Apple's products depend on technology engineered and built here in the United States, and we'll continue to deepen our investments in the U.S. economy because we have an unshakable belief in America's future.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple noted that it already supports over 1,100 jobs in Broadcom's Fort Collins FBAR filter manufacturing facility, and the partnership will see continued investment in automation projects and training technicians and engineers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>5G technology is shaping the future of next-generation consumer electronics â€” and Apple is spending tens of billions of dollars to develop this field in the U.S.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese investments are part of the commitment Apple made in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy over five years. Today, Apple is on pace to meet its target through direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the U.S., and other domestic spend.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the introduction of 5G technology to Apple devices in 2020, Apple has helped expand and expedite 5G adoption across the country, driving innovation and job growth among companies that support 5G innovation and infrastructure. 5G coverage and performance also continue to expand around the world, and more users are benefitting from faster connectivity as they upgrade to 5G-capable products.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/\">United States</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g/\">5G</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/broadcom/\">Broadcom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/23/apple-announces-deal-to-make-components-in-the-usa/\">Apple Announces Multibillion-Dollar Deal With Broadcom to Make Components in the USA</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-multibillion-dollar-deal-with-broadcom-to-make-components-in-the-usa.2390291/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a998a7c91a65e7fef5a392b2562b7611f017e1cda4fc0abab4ccc30e9bb599a","category":"Apple"}
