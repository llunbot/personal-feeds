Mostly mild spoilers for <em>Army of Thieves</em>, but if you haven't seen its predecessor, there is one major spoiler at the end. We'll give you a heads up when we get there.)</strong></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Dead\">Army of the Dead</a></em> followed Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) and his team of mercenaries as they ventured into zombie-infested Las Vegas to recover millions in cash from a casino vault. Brain-munching carnage ensued. In addition to Tig Notaro's delightfully cynical pilot and Samantha Win's martial arts fireworks, viewers loved the dynamic between zombie-killing-machine Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) and the brilliantly nerdy, high-strung German safecracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer). Not only did the two forge a believable (albeit reluctant) bond, Dieter's well-timed high-pitched screams whenever a zombie charged was one of several running gags. So naturally Dieter got his own prequel. And you know what? Schweighöfer's standout character deserved one. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810551#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810551&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cd9c49679f08bc4b1546648944346f9a64a3f75f99cf559538c811720ded3490","category":"Tech"}
