On a daily basis I’m a visual designer, but more importantly I love using trains to go on bikepacking trips with my partner, so the All-Packa was a bit of a no brainer as soon as I started looking into it … it’s such an impressively capable machine, it just makes me want to ride it more and more, the small wheels are incredibly fun.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\"

some salvaged inner bar ends from the parts bin, Paul Canti levers, Microshift 11sp friction shifter bolted to a Paul thumbie, brakes are some 4 pistons Juin GTP-4, which in combination with the Paul levers and some Yokozuna housing results in some of the nicest cable actuated (hybrid) brakes I’ve ever tried.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\"

wrapped grips, and some really cute custom bags that my talented partner made it at home on her small sewing machine!</p>\n<p>I really love the little tool pouch taking the empty space in the rear triangle.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/DSF0122.png?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\"
