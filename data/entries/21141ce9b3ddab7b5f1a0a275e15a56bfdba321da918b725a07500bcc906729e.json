A single 260mm spoke weighs 4.45 grams.</p>\n<p>The spokes are manufactured using a patent-pending cold forging process. This results in a butted spoke – a spoke that’s thinner in the central section than at its ends – which saves weight.</p>\n<p>DT says the process also increases the spoke’s strength by ensuring a uniform transition between the butted part of the spoke and its ends, as well as upping the metal’s density – and hence adding to its strength.</p>\n<h2>More than 100 different nipple options</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss revolite MTB spoke\" title=\"DT_Revolite_Spoke_Keyvisual_1920px\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The patent-pending blade-forming process is claimed to increase the spoke’s strength.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DT Swiss</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Revolite spoke can be used with any of DT’s four nipple designs and has a standard 2mm thread.</p>\n<p>DT’s nipples are available in brass or coloured anodised alloy – there are 65 variants of the standard nipple alone. The DT Squorx nipple includes a Torx interface for easier tightening to higher tensions in addition to its standard square facets.</p>\n<p>DT’s nipples are optionally available with its existing Pro Lock tech, where the threads are pre-coated with an adhesive. This is activated by threading the nipple onto the spoke and hardens to produce a bond between the two pieces.</p>\n<p>This increases wheel durability by up to 20-fold according to DT and prevents the threads from loosening with use. The adhesive doesn’t prevent wheel truing, however, and DT says any truing results in only a minimal decrease in the strength of the bond.</p>\n<h2>Specifications and prices</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss revolite MTB spoke\" title=\"DTSwiss_Revolite_Detail_J-Bend_Straightpull_1920px\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The DT Revolite spoke is available with J-bend or straight-pull and in black or silver.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DT Swiss</i></span></div>\n<p>The new DT Revolite spoke is available in all standard lengths between 194mm and 310mm in a straight-pull or a J-bend format. You can also choose between black and silver finishes to match your bike.</p>\n<p>DT Revolite spokes are available in packs of 20, priced from £59.25/$70/€50.30, in packs of 100 at prices starting at £296.24/$350.20/€251.30, or in packs of 500.</p>\n<p>DT has yet to incorporate the new spokes into its complete mountain bike wheels, but expects that to change in the near future.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"21141ce9b3ddab7b5f1a0a275e15a56bfdba321da918b725a07500bcc906729e","category":"Cycling"}
