I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it on <a href=\"https://x.com/dcrainmakerblog\">Twitter/X</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dcrainmaker.com\">BlueSky</a>, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><strong><span>DCR Posts In The Past Week:</span></strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s all the latest posts on the site:</p>\n<p>Sunday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/week-review-january-19-2025.html\">Week in Review – January 19th, 2025</a><br />\nWednesday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/ironman-fulgaz-plenty.html\">Ironman Sells FulGaz to Rouvy, and Plenty More</a></p>\n<p>Instinct 3 review coming up this week (for real this time), I’ve been spending all the time testing out some new updates that fix a slate of Instinct 3 Solar-specific issues (though, I’ll certainly be calling them out in my review, given the fact that it shipped like this weeks ago). As usual, I prefer to wait a few days to validate important fixes rather than have my reviews (especially YouTube ones) be outdated 48 hours later, especially when I’m calling out a company.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Sports Tech Deals:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Some new ones have popped up this past two weeks. I think the Fenix 7 at $429 is probably the most interesting for people eyeing that new Instinct 3, since this is basically cheaper while having more features. Likewise the Epix back in the $429-$439 range. I’ll continue sweeping and adding in a few more of these later tonight, so keep checking back.</p>\n<table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th></th><th><span>Product</span></th><th><span>Sale Price</span></th><th><span>Amazon</span></th><th><span>Other site</span></th><th><span>Sale Notes</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/05/garmin-rtl515-cycling.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-200x147.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-200x147.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-720x528.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-125x92.png 125w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent.png 750w\" /></a></td><td><a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/05/garmin-rtl515-cycling.html\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin Varia Radar (RTL515) - $50 off</a></td><td>$149</td><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086TVFX1D/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=deviceaccessories-20&amp;linkId=51d1e5ac668ef03bf866d7f666bb3666&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></td><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=7128e6e8-6ace-426f-80ef-177cd2ef6051&amp;url=https://www.rei.com/product/182344/garmin-varia-rtl515-rearview-radar-taillight\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a></td><td>This is Garmin's standalone radar+taillight option, and $149 is pretty much the standard sale-price.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Note that all of the above are Amazon affiliate links, which do help support the site. I appreciate it!</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet:</p>\n<p>1) <strong><a href=\"https://www.thomsonbiketours.com/trips/gravel-morocco/\">I’m going on a gravel trip to Morocco!</a></strong> I’m testing out a new partnership company, mixing my love of travel and cycling (and testing devices on stupid-fun adventures). I’ll be doing a gravel trip to Morocco in March, if you want to join! Here’s a quick little teaser I did on Instagram, though, I made a widescreen one here. Oh, and if you join me on that trip, I’ll have some little goodie bags of DCR stuff for ya.</p>\n<p><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.endurancesportswire.com/uci-approves-nix-biosensors-personalized-hydration-monitoring-technology-for-use-in-competition/\">UCI Approval of Nix Biosensors:</a></strong> Maybe this will get me off my butt to finish the review I’ve started twice now. TDLR: After craptons of data gathering (nearly 30 sessions) on three different people, including all the fun naked pre/post-weigh-ins and more, the sensor simply isn’t reliable. Or at least, isn’t for my sample size of three very different body weight individuals (male and female, from vastly different genetic backgrounds). Supposedly, all three of us are off-the-charts super sweaters. Nix looked at all my raw data for errors in my testing, and found none. Nix often misestimated sweat loss upwards of 67oz/~2L worth</p>\n<p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/apple-watch-alert-saves-skier-after-falling-1000-feet-near-stevens-pass/IXVED4BUCRCEBAHHM2UXPC5MCY/\">Apple Watch alert saves skier after falling 1,000 feet near Stevens Pass:</a> </strong>Given I grew up skiing quite a bit of Stevens Pass, though, in putting the <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/61ziWfhPEjPAaLS7A\">GPS coordinates in</a> (from the helicopter footage there), this is actually not at the main ski area, but well across the street into what I presume is the Nordic side somewhere, over the next mountain.</p>\n<p><strong>4) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349330/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-kids-smartwatch-wear-os\">Samsung Adds Kids Smartwatch Mode to Watch 7:</a></strong> I’ll have to give this a whirl, just for funsies. The concept essentially is a first-stab at what Google, Apple, Garmin, and others have done, in making watches viable for kids (and their parents).</p>\n<p><strong>5) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350413/fitbit-fine-ionic-smartwatch-burns\">Remember the Fitbit Ionic Burn Fiasco?</a> </strong>Well, a settlement has now been reached. Money is changing hands.</p>\n<p><strong>6) <a href=\"https://www.slowtwitch.com/triathlon/his-persistence-benefited-both-ironman-and-st-george-now-hes-looking-to-do-the-same-in-washington-tri-cities/\">How a race director moving towns, moved an Ironman:</a></strong> I always enjoy behind-the-scenes race director type articles, and this is one of them.</p>\n<p><strong>7) <a href=\"https://www.eu.hammerhead.io/blogs/change-logs/karoo-software-build-version-1-538-2049\">Reasonably solid Hammerhead Karoo 2/3 Firmware Update:</a> </strong>This one seems to have a bit more than the average bear does in it, including connection to Intervals.icu, the ability to switch between apps mid-ride,  and for Karoo 3, the ability to utilize your phone connection to build routes dynamically on unit. Plus a bunch of other things.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"da76ed3588a58fb3d8eba80878e4a79c9eeda013f1c2be6f96f96c69f6c87ba6","category":"Cycling"}
