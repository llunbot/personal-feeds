The lens enables users to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos, which retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility. By contrast, last year's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> and ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus used a 12-megapixel camera lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo's report corroborates a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/14/iphone-15-and-15-plus-48mp-camera/\">claim</a> by Jeff Pu, an analyst at Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities, who in May said the 48-megapixel lens on the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus will use a new three-stacked sensor that can capture more light for improved image quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the time, Pu said the stacked sensor was likely facing yield issues that could result in ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus production delays. However, Kuo's latest report suggests Apple has resolved the situation, albeit to the detriment of its rivals.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14-Pro\">iPhone 14 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/kuo-iphone-15-iphone-15-plus-feature-48mp-camera/\">Kuo: iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus to Feature 48-Megapixel Camera That Can Capture More Light</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-plus-to-feature-48-megapixel-camera-that-can-capture-more-light.2396940/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"124207b222286964f11b0b3aa41545ea89051e7d61651d1f21a30a9baa1dcfa0","category":"Apple"}
