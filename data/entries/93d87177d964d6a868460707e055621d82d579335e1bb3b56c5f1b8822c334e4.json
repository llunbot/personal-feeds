September 2023 starts next Friday. September! Anyway, we very much live in the present here so let’s get to recapping the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s obviously been a lot of Vuelta a España content (and more to come) with the final Grand Tour of the year beginning on Saturday. After a week in pro cycling that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-doping\" target=\"_blank\">mainly consisted of doping bans</a>, we asked whether it’s time to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-vuelta-weather-swap\" target=\"_blank\">swap the dates of the Giro and the Vuelta</a>, looked at the stacked list of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-favourites\" target=\"_blank\">favourites for this year’s race</a>, explored the short but storied <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-espana-red-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">history of the red jersey</a>, and put together our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-watch-vuelta-espana\" target=\"_blank\">TV and streaming guide</a>. We also had a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/neil-lora-fachie-paracycling\" target=\"_blank\">Q&amp;A with paracycling legends Neil and Lora Fachie</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the cycling tech world there was news of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/inflabi-inflatable-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">the interesting-looking inflatable helmet</a> that’s claimed to be safer than standard foam helmets, a host of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/type/review\" target=\"_blank\">women’s bib short reviews</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/specialized-tarmac-sl8-vs-sl7\" target=\"_blank\">comparison of the Specialized Tarmac SL7 and SL8</a>. It’s more than just a nose job apparently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally Robyn and I were joined on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/cyclist-magazine-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast</a> this week by ex-pro and Le Col founder and CEO Yanto Barker, who discussed his career, the British racing scene, the Richmond Part KoM, all things Le Col and more.

There are four flavours available: Classic Guava, Raspberry Guava, Açai Guava and Coffee Guava and can be bought in packs of four, ten or 27.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each block also comes wrapped in a dried leaf, which is 100% compostable.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy Luchos now from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OT5riE\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon (£13.99 for ten)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more at <a href=\"https://luchos.com/\" target=\"_blank\">luchos.com</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pearson Fiddlesticks long arm hex key set </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"allen key set on a wooden table\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pearson-fiddlesticks-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Will Strickson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m constantly losing multitools – one to a very deep Epping Forest bin with a banana skin, one to the US embassy, one broke trying to take out some very stiff pedals – and without space for a proper tool set-up that means I’m often left rifling through the household toolbox for the right size allen keys. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why Pearson’s Fiddlesticks are ideal: there’s no way I’ll take them out the house, they’re long enough to not fall victim to poorly fitted pedals, and if they’re easy to find in a messy box/drawer/shed thanks to their case and colours. I was also told by deputy editor James Spender that ‘everyone needs a set of coloured hex keys’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re made from a durable Chrome-Vanadium steel, have rubber coating for extra grip and range from 1.5mm to 10mm, each with a different colour and number label to save precious fiddling time testing each one. They also have a hex-end and a ball-end to help get either more torque or the right angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the Fiddlesticks now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearson1860.com%2Fproducts%2Ffiddlesticks-long-arm-allen-key-tool-set\" target=\"_blank\">Pearson (£20)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/yanto-barker-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 86: Yanto Barker, Le Col CEO and Richmond Park KoM</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/torque-flavourless-gel\">In the Drops: New Canyon Endurace CFR, flavourless Torq gels, Lizard Skins’ latest bar tape and home workouts</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a España 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything we know so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: NFL and playlist #15</h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Football is back! And yes you’ve realised by now I’m not talking about football football. My interest in watching the world’s favourite sport is waning (international tournaments excluded, shoutout the Lionesses), partly due to huge overexposure, partly due to boredom, partly due to the team I’ve always supported being taken over by Saudi Arabia. While I’m trying to keep up – because trying to function in society without football knowledge/enthusiasm is practically impossible – it’s already too late because the other football has stolen my heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got into watching the NFL a few years ago and it didn’t take long to become obsessed once I figured out the rules/terminology. It’s incredibly entertaining, despite what the three-hour standard game time suggests, with so many matches coming down to the final moments, and isn’t absolutely everywhere in the UK, so no overexposure possible. Plus, with its socialist structure, every team (pretty much) has a shot of being good every year, and it’s hard for teams to either dominate or be persistently terrible unlike in football (it happens but it’s hard, which says enough about those teams).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games are easy to watch – late night time zones aside, but most games are 6pm UK time on Sundays – the highlights packages of every game are free on YouTube very soon after the games finish and there are shows on actual British TV – ITV, Channel 5 and Sky Sports – to keep up with it all too. And once you’re in there’s a literal endless stream of extra content, which means not a day goes by without listening to an NFL-related podcast/watching an NFL-related YouTube show, my favourite being the Around the NFL podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With family connections to New York (and the first game I ever watched being the Super Bowl in 2008), I picked up the New York Giants as my team and so far they’ve matched the same levels of quality I’ve come to expect from my sports teams: subpar. But things are looking up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friendship over with football, now football is my best friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it’s time to share my fifteenth In the Drops new music playlist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month is two-hours long and full of good songs. Highlights include new releases from Big Thief, Oscar Lang, Mitski, Bakar, Courtney Barnett, Kojaque, Mr Eazi as well as new discoveries in Holly Walker, Uma, KhakiKid, Bricknasty and Miso Extra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of all though, one of my all-time favourites Willie J Healy released his album ‘Bunny’ today and it’s excellent. So if you can’t be bothered to listen to the playlist, just listen to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adios<em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1xOTJEIhg194R8QF3b9LdA?si=35038be6056f427b\" target=\"_blank\">In the Drops #15 on Spotify</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/1151659770/playlists\" target=\"_blank\">all my In the Drops playlists</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ekoi-ottimo-sunglasses\">In the Drops: Ekoï Ottimo sunglasses, Luchos Guava energy blocks, Pearson Fiddlesticks and the NFL</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"93d87177d964d6a868460707e055621d82d579335e1bb3b56c5f1b8822c334e4","category":"Cycling"}
