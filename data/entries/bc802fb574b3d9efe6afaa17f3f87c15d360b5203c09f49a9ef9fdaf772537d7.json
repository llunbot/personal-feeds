This means that Pink would replace Green from the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other hand, the <strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong> and <strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong> will purportedly continue to be available in four color options: <strong>Black</strong>, <strong>Silver</strong>, <strong>Gold</strong>, and <strong>Bronze</strong>. This means that Black would replace Graphite from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> lineup, while Bronze would replace Pacific Blue.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMatte black and bronze ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro color options were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/iphone-13-matt-black-stainless-steel-coating/\">rumored earlier this year</a>, and there were also very sketchy reports of a pink ‌iPhone 13‌ model, so it is possible that this is the origin of these listed color options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also reportedly intends to offer the following storage options for each model size in the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup:\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>iPhone 13 mini</strong>: 64GB and 128GB</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>iPhone 13</strong>: 64GB and 128GB</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong>: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong>: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis would mean that the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup storage configurations would be largely the same as the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup, but with no 256GB option for the 5.4-inch \"mini\" model and the standard 6.1-inch model, which seems like a very peculiar move that would reduce the variety of options and top amount of storage for customers of both entry-level ‌iPhone 13‌ models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther Ukrainian e-commerce sites appear to be listing slightly different storage options for each model, with some showing <a href=\"https://ilounge.ua/products/apple-iphone-13-mini-128gb-kupit\">no 64GB option</a> for the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini but a new 512GB option instead, and others showing options <a href=\"https://stylus.ua/iphone-170/seriya:iphone-13-mini/\">all the way up to 1TB</a>. As a result, KTC's information should be taken with a pinch of salt. It is also worth noting that KTC shows no sign of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/iphone-13-third-week-september-1tb/\">rumored 1TB storage option</a> for the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro models. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/\">91mobiles.com</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/iphone-13-fewer-storage-options-and-new-colors/\">iPhone 13 Said to Offer Fewer Storage Options and New Pink Color, iPhone 13 Pro Adds Black and Bronze Colors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-said-to-offer-fewer-storage-options-and-new-pink-color-iphone-13-pro-adds-black-and-bronze-colors.2310176/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_-NTtsd844k:0md98I3SgHY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_-NTtsd844k:0md98I3SgHY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_-NTtsd844k\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc802fb574b3d9efe6afaa17f3f87c15d360b5203c09f49a9ef9fdaf772537d7","category":"Apple"}
