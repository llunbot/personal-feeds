We already know the benefits—deeper blacks, better efficiency, and superior color handling—but a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.displaysupplychain.com/blog/apple-to-announce-oled-ipads-on-may-7th-lgd-and-12-9-dominating-on-sdcs-challenges&amp;xcust=1-1-2318765-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">report from Ross Young</a> at Display Supply Chain Consultants claims the OLED panels in the next iPad Pro will be the best in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Young writes that the OLED panels used in the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro “are expected to be by far the best OLED tablet panels on the market with LTPO, 120Hz refresh, a tandem stack and glass thinning resulting in ultra-thin and light displays with high brightness, extended battery life and long lifetime.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone uses a single-stack OLED, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=23616&amp;xcust=1-1-2318765-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">previous rumors</a> claimed the iPad Pro would adopt a new OLED material from LG called “RDE” that stacks two OLED layers for greater energy efficiency and a longer lifespan. The iPad Pro will also reportedly have a thinner design made possible by the reduction in display thickness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2318178/shock-report-ipad-pro-m4-chip-not-m3.html\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a>, the new iPad Pro may also be the first Apple product to get an M4 processor, the first time an M-series chip has debuted in a device other than a Mac. Apple will unveil the new iPad Pro at its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">Let Loose event</a> on May 7.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b80d3efede62dc456ecead1cf5628de91d0e734c70a31aca4df45202069dfb20","category":"Apple"}
