{"title":"LBJ on the Difference between Republicans and Democrats","link":"https://www.lbjlibrary.org/life-and-legacy/the-lbj-the-nation-seldom-saw","date":1738626900000,"content":"\n<p>The LBJ Presidential Library, regarding a largely ad-libbed address Lyndon Johnson gave to a group of 150 non-incumbent Democratic candidates for Congress in 1966:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He talked about the difference between Republicans and Democrats:\n“We’re for something, and they are against everything. Mr. Rayburn\nwas asked one time, ‘What do you think — after 50 years — is the\nprimary difference between the Republican and Democratic parties?\nIs it the tariff?’</p>\n\n<p>“‘No.’</p>\n\n<p>“‘Well, what is the difference?’</p>\n\n<p>“Mr. Rayburn replied, ‘I’ll tell you the easiest and best\nexplanation — one that I have observed, and I came here during\nWoodrow Wilson’s administration. They hate all of our Presidents.’</p>\n\n<p>“He said, ‘I didn’t hate Harding. I felt sorry for him, but I\ndidn’t hate him.’ He said, ‘I didn’t hate Coolidge. I thought he\nwas totally inadequate to the responsibility, but I used to go\ndown and eat scrambled eggs and just watch him. He never said\nanything. You couldn’t tell what he thought of anything.’</p>\n\n<p>“He said, ‘I didn’t get angry with Hoover. Everything in the\ncountry folded up and we had bread lines all over the country\nand everybody in the Southwest was chasing rabbits in order to\neat. But I didn’t hate him. We tried to help him. But look what\nthey did to Roosevelt when he came in. They were after his wife.\nThey were after his daughter. And they finally got down after\nhis dog.’”</p>\n\n<p>And LBJ pointed toward the South Lawn where his beagles were kept\nand said: “And I’ve got three of them out there to jump on if they\nwant to.”</p>\n\n<p>He talked about the difference between constructive action and\nobstructive action: “Any jackass can kick a barn down. But it\ntakes a carpenter to build one.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Much has changed in the last 60 years. Much has not.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/lbj-republicans-democrats\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"035d83d85e8440889a5387a1570645ea4f260216df777fa4adb12f58035d104b","category":"Tech"}
