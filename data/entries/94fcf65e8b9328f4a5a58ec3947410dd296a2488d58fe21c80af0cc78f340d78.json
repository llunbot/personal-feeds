But I could tell within a matter of hours that the iPhone 16e and I were not going to get on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the end of the day. A long day: I was tired, having traveled to Apple’s London HQ to pick up the review sample (black finish, Winter Blue case: looks great) among a bunch of other jobs. Running on auto-pilot, I reached over to quickly attach the phone to the MagSafe puck by my bed, and then I remembered. The iPhone 16e doesn’t support MagSafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m aware that this is going to sound like the first-worldest of first-world problems from a guy who just got presented with a free iPhone, and that the world’s smallest violin is probably tuning up as I type. But MagSafe is one of those features that showcases Apple at its best: it takes a small inconvenience and sands it away so frictionlessly that you forget the small inconvenience ever existed. Not including it in a 2025 iPhone is not a nice thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years back, wirelessly charging an iPhone was a mild faff because you had to place it on exactly the right part of the puck, check it was charging correctly, and then make sure not to nudge it with an inadvertent elbow. Get any of this wrong and there was a fair chance you’d wake up (possibly later than planned, if you were depending on an alarm) with an iPhone that was not charged, but dead. With the launch of the iPhone 12 in 2020, MagSafe changed all that overnight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you had to do was hold the iPhone somewhere in the vicinity of a compatible charging puck’s sweet spot and it would be sucked into the optimal placement by powerful magnets and held there securely. The screen showed you that it was charging with a neat animation and there was no doubt that your phone would be filled up the next time you reached for it.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 12 with Magafe charging on screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-12-with-MagSafe.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>MagSafe is a fantastic Apple feature that  takes the guesswork out of wireless charging.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first generation, it was a brilliant and helpful innovation and it became (at least for me) a totally standard aspect of owning an iPhone, something I benefited from without being conscious of that fact. It’s taken the arrival of the MagSafe-free iPhone 16e four and a half years later to remind me how essential and brilliant the feature is, and it really is a wrench going back to the old way of doing things. Not a disaster, of course, but a small, unexpected, and persistent annoyance. Like when you forget to charge your AirPods and are forced to deal with tangle-prone wired headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of MagSafe on the iPhone 16e is a clear backward step, and one that on the surface doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense. There was a rumor initially that it had something to do with the C1 modem, but Apple quickly denied that, insisting instead that it had been left off deliberately because the target audience <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2623411/heres-why-the-iphone-16e-doesnt-have-magsafe-according-to-apple.html\">prefers to charge with a cable</a>. Maybe that’s true; I haven’t seen the company’s customer research. But I’d venture to suggest that the real reason has more to do with product differentiation and upselling the phones Apple would prefer for you to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not going to pretend that Tim Cook will shed a tear every time someone buys an iPhone 16e. But he’d probably consider the transaction somewhat bittersweet: a sale gained, but a bigger sale lost. It’s hard not to think that MagSafe has been left off so potential buyers will think to themselves, “Maybe I should spend an extra $200 for an iPhone 16.” That’s also why there’s a stingy single camera on the rear when Apple has been selling phones with two cameras since 2016 and with <em>three</em> cameras since 2019. (You’d think it would be easier from a manufacturing point of view, given that the 16e appears to be based on an iPhone 14 chassis, to have two.) I’d even blame this strategy for the 16e’s limited range of color finishes: if you want pink, teal, or ultramarine, you need to get the 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the “Mag” part of MagSafe is a dealbreaker for you—and it might be a considerably bigger factor for those with car mounts than it is for me—then you should note that there is a workaround: you can simply <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2623265/how-to-add-magsafe-to-the-iphone-16e.html\">add a MagSafe case</a>. It won’t get you MagSafe’s faster charging speeds or add much more than a magnetic connection, but that doesn’t make much difference when you just want to charge overnight. That’s what I’m planning to do, anyway. (Albeit under protest, since I’d rather use Apple’s Winter Blue case, but it obviously doesn’t have MagSafe.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not the end of the world, then, and I don’t expect the lack of MagSafe to guarantee the iPhone 16e a devastating hatchet job of a review. (You’ll have to wait and see if other factors lead to that.) But you’d have to say that it’s an odd strategy, reminding customers how good a feature is by removing it from a new product. Good job, Apple: You’ve taught me not to take MagSafe for granted. But can we please have it back now?</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.
