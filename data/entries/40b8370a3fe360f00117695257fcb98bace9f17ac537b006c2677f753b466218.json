Google Shopping has been rebuilt from the ground up with AI, pairing 45 billion product listings with Google Gemini AI models to provide a more personalized shopping experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe overhauled Google Shopping feature uses AI to show the most relevant products when someone searches for something to buy. Google will provide an AI-generated brief with top suggestions to consider when making a purchase, along with some recommendations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nResults will be organized into categories to provide an overview of different types of products, and there are dynamic filters that will let users narrow down results based on their preferences. Google has also added in the virtual try-on option and AR shopping tools, along with a \"Deals\" section for browsing personalized deals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a new Google Shopping home page that has a personalized feed populated with suggestions based on user preference and past searches. Personalized results can be turned off by going to the Google Shopping menu and tapping on \"Shopping preferences\" at the bottom of the page.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.google.com/shopping\">new Google Shopping website</a> is rolling out now in the United States, but not all users will see it right away. Google says it will take a few weeks for it to be available to all U.S. users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/google-shopping-ai-update/\">Google Shopping Revamped With AI Integration and Personalized Suggestions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-shopping-revamped-with-ai-integration-and-personalized-suggestions.2440162/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40b8370a3fe360f00117695257fcb98bace9f17ac537b006c2677f753b466218","category":"Apple"}
