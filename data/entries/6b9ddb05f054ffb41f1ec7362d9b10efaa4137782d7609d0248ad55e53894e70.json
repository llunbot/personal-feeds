Like an earlier protocol, known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiegand_interface\">Wiegand</a>, OSDP provides a framework for connecting card readers, fingerprint scanners, and other types of peripheral devices to control panels that check the collected credentials against a database of valid personnel. When credentials match, the control panel sends a message that opens a door, gate, or other entry system.</p>\n<h2>Broken before getting out the gate</h2>\n<p>OSDP came about in the aftermath of an attack demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-08/Franken/Presentation/bh-dc-08-franken.pdf\">in 2008</a> at the Black Hat security conference. In a talk there, researcher Zac Franken demonstrated a device dubbed Gecko, which was no bigger than a US quarter. When surreptitiously inserted by a would-be intruder into the wiring behind a peripheral device, Gecko performed an adversary-in-the-middle attack that monitors all communications sent to and from the control panel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959810#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959810&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b9ddb05f054ffb41f1ec7362d9b10efaa4137782d7609d0248ad55e53894e70","category":"Tech"}
