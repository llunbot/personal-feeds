Now that Sony has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/\">shut off the game's servers after just two weeks</a>, you might think those now-useless discs would be practically worthless.</p>\n<p>Instead, the physical version of <em>Concord</em> on PS5 has become a surprise collector's item. An Ars analysis of nearly 300 eBay listings completed between September 3â€“8 shows new copies of the now-defunct game selling for a median price of $100 since the game's shutdown. That going rate peaked at a median of $118 on September 5, up from $89.50 on September 3, before settling at $110 for eBay sales made on September 8.</p>\n<h2>Supply and demand</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/meet-the-man-who-got-100000-for-a-copy-of-super-mario-bros/\">usual</a> with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/hard-to-find-nes-classic-edition-sees-200-ebay-price-markup-at-launch/\">gaming collectibles</a>, the price increase has less to do with playability and more to do with rarity. GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing\">told IGN last month</a> that he estimated an underwhelming 25,000 total sales for <em>Concord</em> across PS5 and PC. Even if we assume 80 percent of those sales were on the PS5, most of those console sales probably came as purely digital downloads, given <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games\">long-running industry trends</a> and the game's focus on online play.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048411#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048411&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b6e0cfafc23c73ee5a49f82f222301d8f0d7d05159a48322af6b0a4ba9efd8f7","category":"Tech"}
