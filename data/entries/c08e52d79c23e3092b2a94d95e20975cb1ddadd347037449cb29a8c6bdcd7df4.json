On Friday, Charter Communications reported a net loss of 154,000 Internet subscribers that it said was mostly driven by customers canceling after losing the federal discount. About 100,000 of those subscribers were reportedly getting the discount, which in some cases <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/05/biden-praises-isps-for-price-cuts-even-as-they-sabotage-his-fcc-nominee/\">made Internet service free</a>Â to the consumer.</p>\n<p>The $30 monthly broadband discounts provided by the ACP <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/fcc-makes-last-plea-to-congress-as-broadband-discount-program-runs-out-of-cash/\">ended in May</a> after Congress failed to allocate more funding. The Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Summary-of-Funding-Request-to-Meet-Critical-Needs.pdf\">requested</a> $6 billion to fund the ACP through December 2024, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/republicans-slam-broadband-discounts-for-poor-people-threaten-to-kill-program/\">Republicans called</a> the program \"wasteful.\"</p>\n<p>Republican lawmakers' main complaint was that most of the ACP money went to households that already had broadband before the subsidy was created. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel warned that killing the discounts would reduce Internet access, <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402286A1.pdf\">saying</a> an FCC survey found that 77 percent of participating households would change their plan or drop Internet service entirely once the discounts expired.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039833#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039833&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c08e52d79c23e3092b2a94d95e20975cb1ddadd347037449cb29a8c6bdcd7df4","category":"Tech"}
