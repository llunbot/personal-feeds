As an arctic blast sweeps across much of the US, and snow blankets our favorite Southwest trails, we’re taking a look back at our ten favorite fat-bike reviews from the last few years. You’ll see a few of the usual suspects from Surly, but we’re also resurrecting one-off creations from the archives and even a Readers’ Ride.

After bluntly stating that he “hated” his inaugural fat-bike experience on a Pugsley, Morgan Taylor was pretty sure this was a bike he didn’t want, and never would. And yet, like a cat-allergic softie who gets talked into adopting a stray kitten, he somehow found himself giving this 2013 oddity a home. If you missed this one, be sure to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/throw-the-parts-bin-at-it-morgans-26-surly-pugsley/\" target=\"_blank\">go back and read</a> how two sessions with the parts bin turned a reluctant Morgan into a proud Pugsley owner.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Danie%CC%81l-and-His-Black-Sheep-Titanium-Fat-Bike-49.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/black-sheep-custom-titanium-fat-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel and His Custom Black Sheep Titanium Fat Bike</a></h3>\n<p>It’s fitting that you should live a little—or a lot—before investing in a ‘forever bike.’ By the time Daniel commissioned this custom titanium fat bike, based around Black Sheep’s ‘Speedster,’ he’d left the grueling winters of Connecticut from his childhood behind and spent a two-decade stint basking in the year-round riding of the Bay Area. But when a pandemic move brought him and his family to Santa Fe, New Mexico, he was once again forced to come to terms with winter. After a season on a second-hand Surly Ice Cream Truck converted him to the Church of the Fat Bike, he decided to go all-in and sent James Bleakley a deposit for the build above: a twin-top-tube titanium chassis hitched to a 150-millimeter-spaced suspension-corrected segmented fork, blinged out with a few custom components including a 22.2-millimeter handlebar, and front and rear racks. In <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/black-sheep-custom-titanium-fat-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">his original write-up</a>, Daniel assures that the bike “rides as good as it looks” and adds that he’s taken to spending time on it year-round. As a final testament to this bike’s ride quality, he even sold his gravel bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/WinsorSnowShuttle-12.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/otso-voytek-review/\" target=\"_blank\">More Than Just a Fat Bike: John Reviews the Otso Voytek</a></h3>\n<p>After riding the Voytek through three seasons, John Watson reviewed Otso’s answer to the fat bike in September 2021. At the time, the original Voytek’s 183-millimeter q-factor gave it the narrowest stance among its plus-tired contemporaries, and its suspension-corrected geometry and tuning-chip design gave it off-snow versatility. In retrospect, the Voytek seems to have presaged trends to come, while remaining a relevant adventure platform in the years since its inception.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-7.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kyles-sklar-touring-fat-bike-in-29-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle’s Sklar Touring Fat Bike in 29+ Mode</a></h3>\n<p>This bike proves the old adage, “the third time’s the charm.” Or, rather, in the case of this Sklar fat bike, the third <em>owner</em> is the charm. Built for the 2016 North American Handmade Bike Show (NAHBS) in the earlier days of Sklar bikes, Adam made this bike for his friend, Colin Frazer. It migrated from Bozeman to Los Angeles, and changed hands twice, before ultimately landing in Kyle Klain’s garage in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The steel frame shows off Sklar’s signature curves and a custom finish from <a href=\"https://www.blackmagicpaint.com/sklar-fat-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Black Magic Paint</a>, but Kyle put his own spin on the build, swapping the 26+ fat-bike tires in favor of 29+ for desert touring.

Originally documented by John on a 2017 Death Valley ‘prospecting tour’—where the trio of friends promised to take “only photos”—Erik’s aluminum Fatboy frame and carbon fork (read the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/death-valley-prospectors-pack-mule-eriks-desert-sand-fatboy/\" target=\"_blank\">original Reportage</a> for how he got creative attaching that front Surly Rack) in its loaded-down state exemplifies the burly benefits of fat bikes. Plus, that custom desert sand finish adds something a little extra.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/morgan-taylor-stephanie-wednesday-26.jpeg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/morgan-taylor-stephanie-wednesday-26.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/morgan-taylor-stephanie-wednesday-26.jpeg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/morgan-taylor-stephanie-wednesday-26.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/morgan-taylor-stephanie-wednesday-26.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/stephanies-surly-wednesday-fat-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephanie’s Surly Wednesday With Studs and SimWorks</a></h3>\n<p>If you don’t care about going fast, there’s an argument to be made that a fat bike like the Wednesday is the real quiver-killer. Or, at least, Morgan Taylor inadvertently makes this case by walking through the various—and storied—iterations of their partner, Stephanie’s, Surly Wednesday. From riding rigid on trails, to summer bike tours, and snowy winter commutes on studded tires, the Wednesday starts to sound like a pretty compelling all-arounder after <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/stephanies-surly-wednesday-fat-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">reading Morgan’s review</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?resize=1024,819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?resize=1800,1440&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?resize=1335,1068&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?resize=700,560&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/SnowBeer-06a.jpeg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/readers-rides-peters-reeb-donkadonk-fatbike/\" target=\"_blank\">Readers’ Rides: Peter’s REEB Donkadonk Fat Bike</a></h3>\n<p>Our long-running Readers’ Rides series turns the spotlight on a reader’s build each week.

Built around a 135-millimeter-spaced Rohloff hub in the rear, Sam managed to maintain room for a five-inch rear tire (though, if you’re Type A, we’d recommend avoiding close inspection of the crank clearance) thanks to the elevated chainstays and warped seatstays. At the time of <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sams-garage-built-135mm-rohloff-fat-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">our original documentation in 2019</a>, standout components in front of the bottom bracket included a Works Components’ adjustable headset and a SON Edelux beacon paired with a dyno hub. But, last we heard, Sam had plans to chop up the frame and keep experimenting. Long live the garage builder!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Mars-Rover.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/philly-bike-expo-mars-cycles-fatbike-rover-with-iozzio-stem-cap-one-hitter-shotgun/\" target=\"_blank\">Philly Bike Expo: Mars Cycles Fat Bike Rover with Iozzio Stem Cap One-Hitter ‘Shotgun’</a></h3>\n<p>We don’t have much to add to this Rover fat bike from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marscycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Cycle,</a> documented by longtime friend of the site <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/jarrod-bunk/\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrod Bunk</a> at the 2019 Philly Bike Expo, because the build largely speaks for itself.
