The design reduces the number of guides for the lower Boa wire from three to one.</p>\n<p>There’s also the same trapezoid-shaped vent in the upper forefoot as seen in the RC903 shoes. In the road shoe, Shimano claimed the redesigned heel cup reduced twisting of the heel and hindfoot movement during hard efforts.</p>\n<p>We haven’t got a good view of the outsole, but <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxs28upMAkg/?img_index=6\" target=\"_blank\">an image posted to Instagram</a> suggests the shoes have retained the four large lugs moulded onto the heel cup.</p>\n<p>Beyond visual changes, as with the RC903, which lost 10g in weight over <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/shimano-s-phyre-rc902/\">its predecessor</a>, we’d expect the new XC903 to be a little lighter than the S-Phyre XC902.</p>\n<p>The fit is also likely to have been updated – the RC903 shoes are considerably wider than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/shimano-s-phyre-rc902/\">RC902</a>, with the wide-fit option wider still.</p>\n<p>We have asked Shimano to confirm whether these are the new S-Phyre XC903 shoes and will update this story if we receive further details.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"3ffdfbc2b9da4482ec2c6ce033bbb0b36e098d751f0f6536df73d5dd23592de2","category":"Cycling"}
