However, the report does not indicate if Disney has actually held discussions with Apple, and there are a few reasons why a sports partnership between the companies is unlikely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ESPN-Banner.jpg\" alt width=\"1296\" height=\"729\" />\r<br />\nFirst, the report says that the idea of an ESPN app being preloaded on the iPhone would be appealing to Disney, but Apple has not offered a built-in iPhone app for a third-party brand since YouTube was removed as a pre-installed app on iOS 6 in 2012.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond, ESPN is currently only available through cable and satellite TV packages, which does not make it a fit to be streamed through the Apple TV app. The report claims that Disney is looking to make the sports network available on an Ã -la-carte basis as early as 2025, but that timeframe likely rules out any imminent partnership.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has instead been focusing on acquiring global rights to live sports content to stream through the Apple TV app and on its Apple TV+ streaming service. For example, Apple reached a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/14/apple-major-league-soccer-partnership/\">10-year partnership with MLS</a> to stream all matches worldwide.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple and Disney already have a close relationship, with Disney CEO Bob Iger having appeared on stage at WWDC 2023 to announce that Disney+ will be available on Apple's Vision Pro headset at launch. Iger also served on Apple's board of directors from 2011 to 2019, and he was friends with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. As of now, however, any partnership between the two companies involving ESPN appears unlikely.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nypost-com/\">New York Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/espn/\">ESPN</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/31/apple-espn-distribution-report/\">Apple Reportedly an Ideal Partner to Distribute ESPN, But Deal Unlikely</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-an-ideal-partner-to-distribute-espn-but-deal-unlikely.2397388/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"64a1ac5d89b3331324fe4a9af43bf72e5a48ef69f1b691418d6b548ad19baebc","category":"Apple"}
