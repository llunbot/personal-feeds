Like many people on real-life video calls, the avatars only feature business attire from the waist up.

The 3D avatars are a component of \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/with-mesh-for-teams-microsoft-plans-to-bring-3d-workspaces-to-remote-workers-in-2022/\">Mesh</a>,\" an initiative Microsoft announced back in late 2021 when the \"metaverse\" hype had reached a fever pitch. As originally envisioned, Mesh will include not just 3D Teams avatars, but virtual workspaces accessible via VR, so that people working remotely can experience the joy of sitting in a meeting room while someone drones on in front of a PowerPoint deck.</p>\n\n<p>The roadmap update doesn't include a complete list of features, but previous announcements about Mesh for Teams have shown avatars with customizable body types, skin tones, hair colors and hairstyles, clothes, and facial features. Microsoft said in late 2021 that the initial versions of these avatars would only animate when users were speaking, but eventually the company wants them to be able to mimic users' real-world facial expressions and movements as captured by their webcams.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923940#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923940&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5f8cf043fa1a159953db3d245870ae36c6bd7b581cfe52da492844c179976c68","category":"Tech"}
