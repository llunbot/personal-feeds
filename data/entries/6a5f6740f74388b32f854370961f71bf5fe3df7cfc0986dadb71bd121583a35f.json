The earpiece speaker that was removed from the display has been relocated between the front-facing camera and the Face ID module.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to iFixit, despite the decoupling of the Face ID module and the display, any display replacement disables Face ID. This means that screen replacements not authorized by Apple will result in non-functional Face ID components.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/24/iphone-13-battery-capacities-in-mah/\">found out</a> last week, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is using an 11.97Wh battery, which equates to 3,095mAh, up from 2,815mAh in the ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro. The battery in the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ has an L-shaped design this year, a departure from the rectangular battery used in last year's Pro model. iFixit says that battery swap tests have been successful, despite rumors that battery replacements wouldn't be possible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's 6GB SK Hynix LPDDR4X RAM inside, along with several Apple-designed power management and ultra-wide band chips, and as expected, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is equipped with Qualcomm's SDX60M modem and what iFixit believes is a Qualcomm DRR868 5G RF transceiver.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ifixit-iphone-13-pro-disassembled.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that the Qualcomm modem chip in this year's iPhones has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/\">satellite communication functionality</a>, but if it's in there, iFixit didn't notice and as no satellite feature has been announced, it's a latent function if it exists. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-emergency-satellite-features-iphones/\">has clarified</a> that Apple is working on a satellite feature that will let people send texts in emergency situations using a satellite connection, but this functionality isn't expected until 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMoving on, the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ features Kioxia NAND Flash memory, a front-end module from Broadcom, an NXP Semiconductor NFC controller, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+13+Pro+Full+Chip+ID/144993\">and more</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niFixit's <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928\">full teardown</a> has more detail on all of the components that are inside the device, and iFixit ultimately gave the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ a repairability score of 5 out of 10 due to the Face ID display replacement issue, the double glass, and the waterproofing methods that make some repairs more difficult.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/ifixit-iphone-13-pro-teardown/\">iFixit's Full iPhone 13 Pro Teardown Shows Merged Face ID Components and Highlights Display Replacement Issues</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixits-full-iphone-13-pro-teardown-shows-merged-face-id-components-and-highlights-display-replacement-issues.2313970/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qCHu0kFYOVk:z7ypcRJ_MnU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qCHu0kFYOVk:z7ypcRJ_MnU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qCHu0kFYOVk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6a5f6740f74388b32f854370961f71bf5fe3df7cfc0986dadb71bd121583a35f","category":"Apple"}
