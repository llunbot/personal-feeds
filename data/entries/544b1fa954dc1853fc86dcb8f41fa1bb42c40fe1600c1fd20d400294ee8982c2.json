He said a key new feature of the M4 chip will be an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/\">upgraded Neural Engine</a> that boosts performance for AI tasks, and he believes Apple will market the next iPad Pro as an AI-powered device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond, he said that the new Apple Pencil that is expected to be announced at the event will feature haptic feedback for the first time. While he did not provide any details about how this will work, perhaps the Apple Pencil will have a small Taptic Engine that vibrates when switching between drawing tools, and using the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/\">rumored \"squeeze\" gesture</a> that <em>MacRumors</em> previously discovered within the iPadOS 17.5 beta's code.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThird, he reiterated that Apple will introduce a first-ever <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/\">12.9-inch version of the iPad Air</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/\">redesigned Magic Keyboard</a> for iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's event begins on May 7 at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time), with a video stream to be available on Apple.com and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo\">on YouTube</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/\">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/\">Apple Event Rumors: iPad Pro With M4 Chip and New Apple Pencil With Haptic Feedback</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-event-rumors-ipad-pro-with-m4-chip-and-new-apple-pencil-with-haptic-feedback.2425067/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"544b1fa954dc1853fc86dcb8f41fa1bb42c40fe1600c1fd20d400294ee8982c2","category":"Apple"}
