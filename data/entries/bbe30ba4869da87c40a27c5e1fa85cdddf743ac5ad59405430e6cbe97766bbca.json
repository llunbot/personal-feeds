The new negotiated prices will take effect on January 1, 2026.</p>\n<p>The 10 drugs that were up for negotiations are used to treat various conditions, from diabetes, psoriasis, blood clots, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease to blood cancers. About 9 million people with Medicare use at least one of the drugs on the list. In 2023, the 10 drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending, or about 20 percent of total gross spending by Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. But in 2018, spending on the 10 drugs was just about $20 billion, increasing to 46 billion in 2022â€”a 134 percent rise. In 2022, Medicare enrollees collectively paid $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs for these drugs.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices.jpg\"><img alt=\"The 10 drugs as well as their use, 2023 costs, negotiated prices, and savings.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices-640x309.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices-1280x617.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices.jpg\">The 10 drugs as well as their use, 2023 costs, negotiated prices, and savings.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/3e8abec86039ac0ed674a8c5fac492e3/price-change-over-time-brief.pdf\">HHS</a>)</p></div>\n<p>For now, it's unclear how much the newly set prices will actually save those who have Medicare enrollees in 2026. Overall costs and out-of-pocket costs will depend on each member's coverage plans and other drug spending. Additionally, in 2025, Medicare Part D enrollees will have their out-of-pocket drug costs capped at $2,000, which alone could significantly lower costs for some beneficiaries before the negotiated prices take effect.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043687#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043687&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbe30ba4869da87c40a27c5e1fa85cdddf743ac5ad59405430e6cbe97766bbca","category":"Tech"}
