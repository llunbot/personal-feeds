Keep reading to learn how it works.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-via-Satellite.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAvailable in the United States and Canada to owners of iPhone 14 models and newer, Messages via satellite enables users to exchange iMessages and SMS texts, including emoji and Tapbacks, through satellite connections when traditional networks are unavailable. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is using the infrastructure that it set up for Emergency SOS via satellite for this feature, but you don't need to be in an emergency situation to use it, and the service is currently offered at no additional charge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen an iPhone detects it's out of cellular or Wi-Fi range, it prompts users with an alert offering quick access to satellite-enabled services. These include Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Find My, and Messages. Users can also access the feature directly from the Messages app when off the grid, with iOS providing on-screen guidance to help point the iPhone toward an available satellite.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niMessages sent via satellite are end-to-end encrypted. However, it's worth noting that while iMessage functionality is fully supported, SMS capabilities are more limited to prevent abuse from automated systems. Emergency contacts and designated family members can initiate SMS contact at any time, but for other contacts, the iPhone user must send the first satellite SMS to enable responses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo familiarize yourself with this potentially life-saving feature, Apple has included a demo mode in iOS 18. You can access this demonstration by following these steps:\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n<li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Apps</strong>, then tap <strong>Messages</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Satellite Connection Demo</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-via-satellite.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis demo guides you through the process of establishing a satellite connection and sending messages, providing valuable practice for real-world scenarios and emergencies where the feature might be crucial.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the current version doesn't support Rich Communication Services (RCS), Apple could well bridge the remaining gap between traditional and satellite-based communications by expanding the feature's capabilities in a future iOS update.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emergency-sos-via-satellite/\">Emergency SOS via Satellite</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/\">Messages</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/send-messages-without-wi-fi-cellular-iphone/\">iOS 18: Send Messages Without a Wi-Fi or Cellular Connection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-send-messages-without-a-wi-fi-or-cellular-connection.2439520/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"077a3ca8ee27e3380cddf87f5719b0cf66c33f37b96df09fa57766fe21d89a6c","category":"Apple"}
