(photo/Revel)\" /></p>\n<p>The past few months have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for Revel Bikes. Back in mid-April, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-bikes-is-apparently-closing-just-after-launching-three-new-bikes/\">brand announced it was shutting down operations</a> shortly after launching <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-rerun-emtb-ritual-enduro-bike-new-ranger-colors/\">three new bikes at Sea Otter</a>. Then, just a couple of weeks ago, we found out that Revel’s founder, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-bikes-is-back-founder-adam-miller-rescues-beloved-brand-from-private-equity-downfall/\">Adam Miller, bought the brand back</a> after its private equity owners were foreclosed on. That announcement marked the beginning of a new chapter for the brand, with one of the main goals of the company being to “<em>make the best, most innovative bikes we can</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do that, Revel has hired Mike Giese (@steezygiese765 on Instagram) as their new Director of Product and Creative Director. Giese is probably best known for his stylish riding and stunning POV videos on social media — if you haven’t seen them, I highly recommend checking out his Instagram feed. Along with the announcement of his hiring, we were also reminded that he <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/revel-bikes-launch-w-canfield-brothers-suspension-all-new-carbon-fiber-frames/\">designed Revel’s original Rail, Rascal, and Ranger models eight or so years ago</a>. Turns out, he’s not just good at riding bikes, but he apparently knows how to design them, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM.webp\"><img width=\"892\" height=\"595\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM.webp\" alt=\"Instagram announcement of the hiring of Mike Giese as Revel's director of Product and Creative Director.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM.webp 892w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-06-at-1.20.28-PM-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Revel announced Giese’s hiring a few days ago. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Giese is clearly a talent on the bike and was sponsored by Evil Bicycles, ENVE, POC, and others for many years. But while watching his high-speed POV videos, it was much less apparent that he was working as an industrial and graphic designer the whole time. Not only did he design the aforementioned Revel models, but Giese was also a member of the team behind <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trust-performance-sends-the-message-brings-linkage-suspension-forks-to-the-forefront/\">Trust Performance’s linkage forks</a>. More recently, Giese spent the past two years working with GT Bicycles as its Head of Product, before the brand announced it was <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gt-bicycles-pausing-brand-shutting-down/\">pausing operations late last year</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Giese is officially bringing his experience as a rider, designer, and engineer back to Revel as the new Director of Product and Creative Director. According to Revel, Giese is “<em>an absolute legend with creative design and engineering and will power the brand forward in our new chapter of Revel Bikes</em>.” We definitely think Giese is a solid addition to the Revel team, and we’re excited to see what they cook up together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned at <em><a href=\"https://revelbikes.com/\">revelbikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mike-giese-rejoins-the-revel-bikes-team-as-director-of-product/\">Mike Giese Rejoins the Revel Bikes Team as Director of Product</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6fea751a82a2a500bcd740dcfbed60eb6025ca9b26dd543c62b0262b66ba01af","category":"Cycling"}
