It’s happened a few times throughout the brand’s long history, most recently with the fourth-generation Navigator. The introduction of the 2018 Navigator also sparked a huge overhaul in design and technology for the brand that catapulted it from “decent free rental car upgrade” to a maker of luxury SUVs that people might want to buy. The 2024 Lincoln Nautilus is just such an SUV.</p>\n<p>In the hierarchy of Lincoln models, the Nautilus sits neatly between the Aviator and the smaller Corsair. It’s arguably one of the best looking of the current crop of Lincolns, and it’s positioned to compete with the likes of the Lexus RX, the Cadillac XT6 and Volvo’s XC60, among others. But does it actually compete? Or is it simply another car for the Enterprises and Hertzes of the world?</p>\n<p>The 2024 Nautilus is available in two flavors: a purely internal combustion-powered version with a 250 hp (186 kW) turbocharged inline-four that also puts out 280 lb-ft (380 Nm) of torque and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission; and a much more interesting hybrid version, which offers up 310 combined hp (231 kW) that's paired with a CVT transmission. The Nautilus is only available with all-wheel drive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010079#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010079&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5544075045c7da465e8ef1eaa271608fdb81b8b96e6c5bee2a3f2bdd3d0e7a97","category":"Tech"}
