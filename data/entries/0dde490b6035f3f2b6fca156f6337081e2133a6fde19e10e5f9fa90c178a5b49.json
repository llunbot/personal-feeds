It's a neat trick to fall back on if AirDrop is playing up or your iCloud Photos are taking ages to sync. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-apple-pencil.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3057\" height=\"1720\" />\r<br />\nUniversal Clipboard is usually associated with copying and pasting text, but by using this gesture, you can make it work really well for sharing images between your devices too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt can be used to quickly copy images across nearby devices for pasting into Messages, Notes, emails, Pages, and other apps with input fields.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the following steps to work, you'll need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on and your devices signed into the same Apple Account and connected to the same network. \r<br />\n<ol><li>Make sure Handoff is enabled on your devices: On Mac, select <strong>System Settings ➝ General ➝ AirDrop &amp; Handoff</strong> and toggle on the switch next to <strong>Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices</strong>. On iPhone/iPad, turn on <strong>Settings ➝ General ➝ AirDrop &amp; Handoff</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Handoff</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>On iPhone or iPad, perform a three-finger pinch gesture on a photo. On Mac, use the <strong>Command+C</strong> keyboard shortcut.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Switch to the device you want to share the photo with, and then pinch outward with three fingers to paste it into a text field. If on a Mac, you can perform this gesture on the trackpad or use the <strong>Command+V</strong>.</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/share-gesture-ios.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2898\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat's all there is to it. You will know that your three-finger gestures have been recognized when \"Copy\" and \"Paste\" appear at the top of the device's screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTip: You can also cut images to Universal Clipboard using the same three-finger pinch gesture by performing it two times in rapid succession.
