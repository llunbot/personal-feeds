After all, it may lead to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-science-how-to-prevent-cycling-knee-pain\" target=\"_blank\">knee</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-prevent-lower-back-pain-on-the-bike\" target=\"_blank\">back pain</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes to getting your feet into roughly the correct spot this simple six-step procedure will get you on the right track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, make sure you’ve got <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">the right pedals for you</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02125148/how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_2_youll_need-970x485.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_2_youll_need\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You will need:</strong> Allen key, Grease, Cleat lube  <br /><strong>Time taken:</strong> 10 minutes</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-fit-20\">How bike-fit has changed: Phil Burt interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-get-stronger-legs-for-cycling\">How to get stronger legs for cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-adjust-your-saddle\">How to adjust your saddle</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">Best road bike pedals 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>How to fit and adjust cleats in six steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Mark the position across the ball of your foot</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02125151/how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_3_step_1-970x606.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_3_step_1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pop your shoes on. On the inside of your foot, feel for the bit that sticks out behind your big toe. Mark the front of this on the side of the shoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side, find the back of the similar protrusion behind your little toe and mark that, too. To save ruining your shoes, add some masking tape first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Draw between the points and find the midpoint</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02125153/how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_4_step_2-970x606.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_4_step_2\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take your shoes off and flip them over. Draw across the sole the points showing the position of the front and back of the ball of your foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the base of the shoe there will likely be some markings. Use these to align the parallel lines you draw across the sole.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Locate the centre of your cleat</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02125156/how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_5_step_3-970x606.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_5_step_3\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at your new cleats. Most will have a small marking to denote the centre. This is the point that sits directly over the pedal axle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano cleats have a marking on the side, as do Look models. If you haven’t had a bike-fit, we recommend choosing cleats with some ‘float’ or give.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Grease the bolts</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02125158/how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_6_step_4-970x606.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_6_step_4\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your cleats, like your feet, have a hard time on the bike. That’s because sitting close to the ground means they tend to get blasted with water, grit and grime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prevent the bolts that hold them in place from seizing by adding a dab of grease to the holes in the bottom of the shoe before fitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Rotation</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02125200/how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_7_step_5-970x606.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_7_step_5\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the cleats centred between the lines on your shoes, you’re almost done. However, if your heels point either inward or outward, you might want to make some allowance for this by rotating the back of the cleat slightly in the corresponding direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Tighten up</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02125203/how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_8_step_6-970x606.jpg\" alt=\"how_to_fit_and_adjust_cleats_8_step_6\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re happy, tighten everything up and go for a spin. If you find your heels are rubbing against the crank, you might need to make some further adjustments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the ball of your foot is rubbing the crank, you might have a particularly wide stance and need to space the pedals out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>All done?
