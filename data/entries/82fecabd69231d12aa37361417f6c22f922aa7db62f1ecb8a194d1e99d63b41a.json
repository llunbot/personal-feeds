That includes homes or apartments, Netflix, DoorDash, and the same goes for your productivity apps. Something you can do to ease the subscription load—or someone else’s—is to own your daily tools outright, which is usually more affordable in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Tis the season to <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4&amp;utm_term=scsf-610038&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShtIAE&amp;scsonar=1\">own the entire suite of Microsoft Office apps</a> for less than $40. And no, we’re not pulling your leg. Lifetime access to Microsoft Office 2019 for Mac is price-dropped to $39.99 (reg. $229), which is over $30 less than a yearly subscription to Microsoft 365. It could be the perfect last-minute gift for a student or coworker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this isn’t the latest version of Microsoft Office, the 2019 version might be more compatible with an older or refurbished Mac. Users will gain lifelong access to the following apps: <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4&amp;utm_term=scsf-610038&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gShtIAE&amp;scsonar=1\">Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Teams Classic</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create stunning slide decks with PowerPoint to impress an incoming client for your marketing firm, or jump into Excel to crunch numbers for your project manager. If you’re working remotely, use Teams to organize workloads with your colleagues more seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one likes running into obstacles, so make sure you or your giftee’s Mac has had its OS updated to at least Monterey Version 12 or newer. All updates are also included with this license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>December 2022 at 11:59 PM Pacific is the deadline to grab this practical last-minute present.
