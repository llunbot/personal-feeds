When they combined the satellite images with climate data and hydrological models, they found “significant storage declines” in more than half of the bodies of water.</p>\n<p>The combination of information from different sources also enabled the scientists to determine if the declines are related to climate factors, like increased evaporation and reduced river flows, or other impacts, including water diversions for agriculture or cities. A quarter of the world’s population lives in basins where lakes are drying up, they warned.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940456#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940456&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"417e119243da3eac5c6f0bd321fd74d91ef444377fee2114065668b3a279c26d","category":"Tech"}
