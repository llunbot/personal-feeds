Heading east, a Soyuz-2.1b rocket propelled Luna 25 through an overcast cloud deck and into the stratosphere, then shed its four first stage boosters about two minutes into the flight. A core stage engine fired a few minutes longer, and the Soyuz rocket jettisoned its payload shroud.</p>\n<p>A third stage engine fired next, then gave way to a Fregat upper stage to place Luna 25 into an orbit around Earth. The Fregat engine fired a second time to send the nearly 4,000-pound (1.8-metric ton) lunar probe on a roughly five-day trip toward the Moon. Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, declared the launch a success less than 90 minutes after liftoff, shortly after the Luna 25 spacecraft separated from the Fregat upper stage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960296#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960296&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cf910f5152eb508ac473c4adf024795cc91ce602829c8ea2a13274cb0721d8f3","category":"Tech"}
