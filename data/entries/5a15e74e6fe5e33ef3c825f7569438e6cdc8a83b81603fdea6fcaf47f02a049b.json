The brand quickly gained a reputation for its innovation and quality. Parlee bikes were raced at the Tour de France and the Giro d’Italia, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tyler-hamilton-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Tyler Hamilton</a> riding a Parlee frame in Team CSC colours and badged as a Look. Even <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lance-armstrong\" target=\"_blank\">Lance Armstrong</a> bought a Parlee in 2013. Parlee was the first brand to build a disc brake time-trial bike, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ultimate-time-trial-bikes-parlee-ttir-disc\" target=\"_blank\">TTiR Disc</a>, and an early adopter of aerodynamic frame profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parlee, who led the brand’s design and development for over 20 years, had been fighting cancer for the past four years and sold Parlee in 2023. Although semi-retired, he continued to mentor the Parlee team and to sketch new bike ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parlee Cycles’ current owner, John Harrison, paid tribute to Parlee, saying, ‘Bob has been a real inspiration for the entire team here at Parlee, me included. His persistent and unwavering focus on pursuing an uncompromised and perfect product will continue to lead the identity of our business forever into the future. We are all extremely proud to continue the work that he started.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parlee is survived by his wife Isabel and his two sons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, we’ve reviewed many bikes from Parlee’s range.
