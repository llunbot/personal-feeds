However, each bike goes about that aim a little differently.</p>\n<p>Here, while acknowledging what the brands say about their own bikes, I’ve taken a long hard look at both in order to help you decide which is the best one for you.</p>\n<p>My conclusion? The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl8-dura-ace-di2-review-2/\">Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8</a> is probably the faster race bike of these two, but there are certainly caveats that make the bottom line far less clear.</p>\n\n<h2>Introducing the bikes</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 vs Canyon Ultimate CFR\" title=\"Spesh Tarmac vs Canyon Ultimate h2h - 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These are two of the best race bikes your money can buy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kai Eves / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These are so-called all-round race bikes, designed to excel everywhere.</p>\n<p>Both have racy silhouettes, and top-spec carbon constructions and builds, yet both are underpinned by more affordable models, which people are far more likely to be able to afford.</p>\n<p>Largely irrespective of which model falls within your budget, turn up at your local club ride, and your friends are going to know you’re riding one of the most covetable <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a> in the world.</p>\n<p>But while there are certainly similarities between them, there are key differences to note too.

Not since the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-venge-sram-etap-review/\">Venge</a> has the brand offered a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Specialized also makes the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-aethos-comp-review/\">Aethos</a>, a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">climbing bike</a>, but this is very rarely seen used by sponsored teams.</p>\n<p>This year, Specialized evolved the<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl7-review/\"> Tarmac SL7</a> into the Tarmac SL8 and purposely split the new bike into two zones.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rear part of the frame of the Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2 road bike\" title=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2 - 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The seatstays have a rounder profile, reminiscent of the Aethos.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>At the front, where there’s cleaner airflow, it installed the latest Roval Rapide one-piece cockpit, deepened the head tube by extending it forwards (as opposed to the usual fill-in approach) and modified the forward-facing tube surfaces.</p>\n<p>The head tube design turned heads when it appeared in spy shots and at launch, but Specialized says this enabled it to keep the handling geometry exactly the same as the Tarmac SL7.</p>\n<p>All that changed was an extra 10mm stack, required because of the spacers needed to fit the new cockpit.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2 road bike\" title=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2 - 07\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The SL8 has a more rounded outlook than the bike that preceded it.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Further back and in the areas where there’s more turbulent airflow, Specialized looked to the Aethos for inspiration.</p>\n<p>The down tube, seat tube and stays are rounder than they used to be on the Tarmac SL7, which the brand says makes them more efficient at handling the torsional strain of a rider’s weight and pedalling forces.</p>\n<p>This meant excess material – and therefore weight – could be shaved from the frame. As a result, the S-Works Tarmac SL8 frame, built with the brand’s top-of-the-range Fact 12r carbon, weighs a claimed 685g in a size 56cm.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Frame of the Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2 road bike\" title=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2 - 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The most expensive 12r Fact carbon frame, in a 56cm size, weighs 685g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>More interestingly, especially for most of us unable or unwilling to part with £12,000 / $14,000 for a road bike, the less-expensive 10r frames (anything not badged ‘S-Works’) are said to weigh 780g – 20g less than the S-Works Tarmac SL7.</p>\n<p>Overall, Specialized says the Tarmac SL8 is faster than the Venge, which it says is the fastest road bike it had ever made before this. It claims it would save a pro rider two minutes and eight seconds at Milan-San Remo, compared to riding a Tarmac SL7.</p>\n<p>It’s fair to say these examples are extreme, though, and far more should factor into your buying decision.</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                    </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n<tr>\n                                                                                                                                        <th>﻿</th><th><b>44</b></th><th><b>49</b></th><th><b>52</b></th><th><b>54</b></th><th><b>56</b></th><th><b>58</b></th><th><b>61</b></th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td><b>Seat angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>75.5</td><td>75.5</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Head angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>70.5</td><td>71.75</td><td>72.5</td><td>73</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>74</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Chainstay</b> (mm)</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Seat tube</b> (mm)</td><td>433</td><td>445</td><td>456</td><td>473</td><td>494</td><td>515</td><td>545</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Top tube</b> (mm)</td><td>496</td><td>509</td><td>531</td><td>541</td><td>563</td><td>577</td><td>595</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Head tube</b> (mm)</td><td>99</td><td>109</td><td>120</td><td>137</td><td>157</td><td>184</td><td>204</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Fork offset</b> (mm)</td><td>47</td><td>47</td><td>47</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Trail</b> (mm)</td><td>71</td><td>63</td><td>58</td><td>58</td><td>55</td><td>55</td><td>52</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Bottom bracket drop</b> (mm)</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>72</td><td>72</td><td>72</td><td>72</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Bottom bracket height</b> (mm)</td><td>266</td><td>266</td><td>266</td><td>268</td><td>268</td><td>268</td><td>268</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>970</td><td>973</td><td>975</td><td>978</td><td>991</td><td>1,006</td><td>1,013</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Standover</b> (mm)</td><td>723</td><td>735</td><td>746</td><td>768</td><td>786</td><td>808</td><td>834</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>501</td><td>514</td><td>527</td><td>544</td><td>565</td><td>591</td><td>612</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>366</td><td>375</td><td>380</td><td>384</td><td>395</td><td>402</td><td>408</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Crank length</b> (mm)</td><td>165</td><td>165</td><td>170</td><td>172.5</td><td>172.5</td><td>175</td><td>175</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Bar width</b> (mm)</td><td>380</td><td>380</td><td>400</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>440</td><td>440</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Stem length</b> (mm)</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>90</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>110</td><td>110</td>        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n                    \n                \n    \n    \n</div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Ultimate CFR</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Canyon Ultimate CFR Di2\" title=\"Canyon Ultimate CFR -

They whip around with ease when out of the saddle, and the sense of acceleration is high.</p>\n<p>Another benefit to the shallower rim is the wheels feel more stable if you’re riding in stronger winds. If you’re a lighter rider who’s not used to deeper aero wheels, or know your bike handling skills could use work, this might be something to consider.</p>\n<p>For many people, there’s a balance to be struck between the aero performance you’ll get from deeper rims and the stability to be had from shallow ones.</p>\n<p>However, it’s worth remembering there’s a more aero-oriented build available for the Ultimate CFR in the UK and EU, priced exactly the same.</p>\n<p>With the S-Works Tarmac SL8, aside from opting between Shimano or SRAM drivetrains, you’ll be ‘stuck’ with the Rapide CLX II wheels.</p>\n<p>This is no hardship, but it’s worth noting if a shallower wheelset is your preference.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8\" title=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If outright speed is most important to you, the Specialized will be the better choice.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Overall, both bikes tackle road buzz well and are comfortable to ride (considering general race bike compliance levels), although I don’t think the narrow tyre choices make the most of the bikes’ potential in this regard.</p>\n<p>The 25mm Schwalbe Pro One TT tyres on the Canyon are great for a perfect day in the Alps, but aren’t wide or sturdy enough for the kind of road surfaces the vast majority of us will expose them to.</p>\n<p>The same story is true of the 26mm S-Works tyres on the Specialized, albeit they’re a little more well-rounded in their construction.</p>\n<p>I’d look to both upgrade to 700x28c tyres – my pick would be something such as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/continental-grand-prix-5000-s-tr-review/\">Continental Grand Prix 5000 S TR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/pirelli-p-zero-race-tlr-tyre-review/\">Pirelli P Zero Race TLR</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/goodyear-eagle-f1-r-review/\">Goodyear Eagle F1 R</a> – and take the benefits of increased tyre volume over any small aero or rolling resistance gains you might be getting from the stock tyres.</p>\n<h2>Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 vs Canyon Ultimate CFR bottom line</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 vs Canyon Ultimate CFR\" title=\"Spesh Tarmac vs Canyon Ultimate h2h - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Both bikes have much to recommend them.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kai Eves / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>So, which bike is best?</p>\n<p>As with most bike-buying decisions, much comes down to the kind of riding you do, how well it fits you and your budget.</p>\n<p>In these builds, I think the Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 is certainly the more race-ready and rounded of the two, and probably the faster overall. For some, this is the most important thing, and that’s fine.</p>\n<p>Having said that, this Ultimate CFR build can bite back with outstanding climbing prowess on steeper ascents, while the slightly more accommodating ride position should be acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Plus, it’s significantly cheaper, and it’s also worth bearing in mind that (in the UK and EU, at least) there’s an option of an equivalent spec, just with a deeper wheelset, at the same price.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, if you live in the US and have the budget for an S-Works Tarmac SL8 but think an Ultimate CFR is a better fit for you, there’s nothing to stop you from buying an Ultimate, plus a more aerodynamic wheelset.</p>\n<p>I think the S-Works Tarmac SL8 is the purer racer and perhaps the marginally faster bike, but the Ultimate CFR is a better-value deal.</p>","author":"Ashley Quinlan","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"273c5603b60279c5ec840da67a54c84e0af4e337cc2779467dc0702c0f9b2387","category":"Cycling"}
