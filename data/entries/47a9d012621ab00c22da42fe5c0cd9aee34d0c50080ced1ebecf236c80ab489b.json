As with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/beats-studio-buds-launch/\">Beats Studio Buds</a> released a few months ago, the Beats Fit Pro appear to protrude from the ear a fair amount, so the wingtips should help with comfort by helping to ease pressure on the ear canal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBeats Fit Pro will reportedly have Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) with Transparency mode, and they appear to have similar Beats \"b\" logo buttons on the exterior for controls as on the Beats Studio Buds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> are rumored to adopt a stemless design that may resemble the Beats Studio Buds or Beats Fit Pro, but they reportedly won't be launching until sometime next year.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/kim-kardashian-beats-fit-pro/\">Kim Kardashian Spotted Wearing Upcoming Beats Fit Pro Earbuds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kim-kardashian-spotted-wearing-upcoming-beats-fit-pro-earbuds.2318371/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KrE8ASKoH4o:h4mJW3TCues:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KrE8ASKoH4o:h4mJW3TCues:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KrE8ASKoH4o\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"47a9d012621ab00c22da42fe5c0cd9aee34d0c50080ced1ebecf236c80ab489b","category":"Apple"}
