Make no mistake: if they can scan for kiddie porn today, they can scan for anything tomorrow.<br /><br />They turned a trillion dollars of devices into iNarcs—*without asking.* <a href=\"https://t.co/wIMWijIjJk\">https://t.co/wIMWijIjJk</a></p>— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1423469854347169798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 6, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSnowden also noted that Apple has historically been an industry-leader in terms of digital privacy, and even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fbi/\">refused to unlock</a> an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> owned by Syed Farook, one of the shooters in the December 2015 attacks in San Bernardino, California, despite being ordered to do so by the FBI and a federal judge. Apple opposed the order, noting that it would set a \"dangerous precedent.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe EFF, an eminent international non-profit digital rights group, has issued an extensive <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life\">condemnation of Apple's move to scan users' iCloud libraries and messages,</a> saying that it is extremely \"disappointed\" that a \"champion of end-to-end encryption\" is undertaking a \"shocking about-face for users who have relied on the company's leadership in privacy and security.\"<blockquote>Child exploitation is a serious problem, and Apple isn't the first tech company to bend its privacy-protective stance in an attempt to combat it. But that choice will come at a high price for overall user privacy. Apple can explain at length how its technical implementation will preserve privacy and security in its proposed backdoor, but at the end of the day, even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor...\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's impossible to build a client-side scanning system that can only be used for sexually explicit images sent or received by children. As a consequence, even a well-intentioned effort to build such a system will break key promises of the messenger's encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll it would take to widen the narrow backdoor that Apple is building is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content, or a tweak of the configuration flags to scan, not just children's, but anyone's accounts. That's not a slippery slope; that's a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change.</blockquote>The EFF highlighted how various governments around the world have passed laws that demand surveillance and censorship of content on various platforms, including messaging apps, and that Apple's move to scan messages and ‌iCloud Photos‌ could be legally required to encompass additional materials or easily be widened. \"Make no mistake: this is a decrease in privacy for all ‌iCloud Photos‌ users, not an improvement,\" the EFF cautioned.
