On its face, this doesn't seem like the best basis for a semi-randomized multiplayer action game spin-off with strict time limits and an ever-encroaching physical border in a tightly constrained map.</p>\n<p>Somehow, though, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> makes the combination work. The game condenses all the essential parts of <em>Elden Ring</em> down to their barest essence, tweaking things just enough to distill the flavor of a full-fledged <em>Elden Ring</em> playthrough into zippy runs of less than an hour each. The result is a fast-paced, quick-hit shot of adventuring that is well suited to repeated play with friends.</p>\n<h2>Fort-elden Ring-nite</h2>\n<p>The initial moments of each <em>Nightreign</em> run draw an almost comical comparison to <em>Fortnite</em>, with each player dropping into the game's singular map by hanging off the talons of a great spectral eagle. Once on the ground, players have to stay inside a circular \"safe zone\" that will slowly contract throughout each of two quick in-game days, forcing your party toward an eventual encounter with a mini-boss at the end of each day. If you survive both days, you take on one of the several extremely punishing Nightlords you chose to face at the beginning of that run.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/elden-ring-nightreign-is-an-epic-rpg-squeezed-into-delicious-bite-size-capsules/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/elden-ring-nightreign-is-an-epic-rpg-squeezed-into-delicious-bite-size-capsules/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4e8bb1846dfc6b25aefc79f171cad9a66553280d3c6ff5fa30bb797b77ebedc","category":"Tech"}
