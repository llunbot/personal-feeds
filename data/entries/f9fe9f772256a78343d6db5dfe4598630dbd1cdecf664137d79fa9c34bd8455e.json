They’re powerful, they’re beautifully designed, they run macOS (the greatest desktop operating system ever made), and their slim, lightweight bodies fit easily into a rucksack for ease of travel between home, work, and wherever else you want to have access to your machine. But that doesn’t mean you can’t upgrade your MacBook to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to super-charge a MacBook is to equip it with a docking station. These versatile peripherals offer numerous advantages:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong>More ports.</strong> Docks add extra ports, which even on a MacBook Pro can sometimes be annoyingly few in number. And it isn’t just about quantity; it’s also about getting access to types of port your MacBook doesn’t offer out of the box. Whether that means DisplayPort, HDMI, a specific card reader, or simply the old USB-A standard modern Macs have stopped offering, a dock makes life easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong>Ethernet.</strong> One specific port that MacBooks don’t offer is ethernet. Pick a dock with ethernet and you’ve got a powerful option for when Wi-Fi is running slow and you need to give your internet connection a boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong>Easier charging.</strong> Those extra ports in turn make things easier when you want to charge your MacBook. A docking station should feature its own power supply; if your Mac charges via USB-C, plugging in the dock frees up that precious port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong>Less plugging and unplugging.</strong> Another benefit of those extra ports is that you don’t have to constantly plug and unplug the accessories and peripherals you commonly use. There’s simply less hassle with a dock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>…but not just any docking station</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re agreed, then, that a docking station is an excellent and empowering companion for a MacBook. But how do you choose which dock is right for your needs? That’s simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for a dock with a large and varied array of ports. An attractive and easily portable design. Compatibility with lots of MacBook models (including the one you own, of course). Fast-charging capabilities. High-speed data transmission. A price that represents good value for money. And a guarantee from a reputable company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can find a dock that combines all seven of those characteristics, you’re in luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introducing the brilliant FusionDock range</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then again, you don’t have to rely on luck, because we’ve found two such docks for you. They both come under the FusionDock brand, a range of professional MacBook docks renowned for their compatibility and durability. And they match our requirements exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first option, which is perfect for MacBook M1/2/3 owners who use multiple external displays, is called the <strong>FusionDock Pro 1+</strong> and is available <a href=\"https://ivanky.com/products/ivanky-docking-station-max-fusiondock-pro-1?ref=rfvowcxv\" target=\"_blank\">right now</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iVANKY FusionDock Pro 1+\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C600&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iVANKY FusionDock Pro 1+\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C600&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>iVANKY</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iVANKY FusionDock Pro 1+\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C600&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FusionDock-Pro-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>iVANKY</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>iVANKY</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The FusionDock Pro 1+ has a stunning set of tech specs.
