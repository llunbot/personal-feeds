In October and November, NASA launched two pioneering demonstrations to test high-bandwidth optical communication links, and these tech demos are now showing some initial results.</p>\n<p>On December 11, a laser communications terminal aboard NASA's Psyche spacecraft on the way to an asteroid linked up with a receiver in Southern California. The near-infrared laser beam contained an encoded message in the form of a 15-second ultra-high-definition video showing a cat bouncing around a sofa, chasing the light of a store-bought laser toy.</p>\n<p>Laser communications offer the benefit of transmitting data at a higher rate than achievable with conventional radio links. In fact, the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) experiment on the Psyche spacecraft is testing technologies capable of sending data at rates 10 to 100 times greater than possible on prior missions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992668#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992668&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d56e1ccb686c66c5d0737021b32ee09543312e2f18276dd3604c750609821398","category":"Tech"}
