Both kits use the same motor and handlebar mount but have different-size batteries, and cost between £500 and £1,000.</p>\n<p>The Swytch Go kit promises the same ride feel as these kits but has a simpler design in order to bring the cost down.</p>\n<p>Swytch says its existing wait-list subscribers and customer base will be given an exclusive opportunity to pre-order the Swytch Go between 21 and 30 September, with the first kits expected to arrive in spring 2024.</p>\n<p>BikeRadar spoke to Swytch co-founder and CEO Oliver Montague and test-rode the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bike-conversion-kits/\">ebike conversion kit</a> to find out more.</p>\n<h2>A gap in the market</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Swytch go pack on Orbea hybrid bike photographed close up.\" title=\"Swytch-Go20230917_stan-portus48\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Swytch Go promises a lower price point for electric bike riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Swytch launched the Air and Max <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/swytch-technology-electric-bike-conversion-kit/\">last year</a>, having first debuted an ebike conversion kit in 2017 and re-launched in 2019.</p>\n<p>At the time of last year’s launch, Swytch said enabling people to add electric power to a non-assisted bike with a conversion kit rather than buying a new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike</a> would save them money.</p>\n<p>The Swytch Go promises a lower point of entry to electric bike riding.

The supply chain strategy for the Air and Max kits is very complex because it’s a very advanced product.</p>\n<p>“The supply chain strategy for Go is very simple and basic, and it’s all part of keeping the cost down, so as a result there are fewer options available,” says Montague.</p>\n<h2>Why is the Swytch Go only available for pre-order?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Swytch go kit on bike.\" title=\"Swytch-Go20230917_stan-portus58\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Go will initially be available to Swytch’s existing waiting list and customer base via pre-order.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Swytch Go will initially only be available for pre-order between 21 and 30 September to Swytch’s existing waiting list and customer base.</p>\n<p>“The reason we always use pre-order for a new product like the Go kit is mainly to prove demand and viability of the product,” says Montague.</p>\n<p>“The size Swytch is now, we would need more than £10 million just for six months’ supply of kits. We would never risk £10 million on inventory to start selling in April,” he explains.</p>\n<p>Pre-orders therefore enable Swytch to forecast supply, manage business risk and give it the confidence the kits it manufactures will be sold rather than left sitting on shelves.</p>\n<p>Montague says this should help Swytch get to the point where it is selling kits from stock in the long-term.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Swytch Technology CEO Oliver Montague posing with bike fitted with Swytch Go kit.\" title=\"Swytch-Go20230917_stan-portus74-2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Swytch CEO and co-founder Oliver Montague with the Go kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The aim will be to have enough stock to sell Swytch kits in brick-and-mortar retail stores without any sales to shops pushing back the delivery of a kit sold through pre-order, according to Montague.</p>\n<p>Swytch raised £3.8 million in an investment round last year, which followed an initial investment round of £80,000.</p>\n<p>Montague says to maintain shorter delivery times next year, Swytch is raising additional funding from investors specifically for working capital, the money a company has access to in order to meet short-term needs.</p>\n<p>However, the problem with getting its ebike conversion kits into shops and quickly delivering kits to fulfil pre-orders is, according to Montague, “having too much demand”.</p>\n<p>This might be a good problem to have, but Montague says pushing back a more conventional in-stock model will be a good thing to avoid.</p>\n<h2>Swytch Go first ride review</h2>\n<h3>Stan Portus, content editor</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Swytch go pack on Orbea hybrid bike photographed at angle.\" title=\"Swytch-Go20230917_stan-portus43\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Swytch Go provided more than sufficient power for flat, quiet paths.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>I tested a pre-production version of the Swytch Go around the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the canal towpaths of Hackney Wick, London, where Swytch is based, with the company’s CEO Oliver Montague.</p>\n<p>Montague got me to attach the Go kit to the test bike’s frame. Putting it on the bike with its three Velcro straps was as straightforward as installing a frame bag, and plugging the single cable into the port that led to the motor was all it took to get going.</p>\n<p>I test rode Swytch’s pricier kit at Eurobike 2022 and the Go matches the other Swytch kit in terms of how the assistance kicks in. Three or four turns of the cranks and the Swytch motor gave me an assured level of assistance.</p>\n<p>Riding along flat and quiet paths, the speed and power of the motor was more than sufficient.</p>\n<p>When I rode my Swytch Go-equipped bike up a steep, cobble-covered ramp on the towpath, though, I was appreciative of the motor, barely having to pedal to keep my pace up.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Swytch Go kit on bike.\" title=\"Swytch-Go20230917_stan-portus50\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Swytch Go was easy to attach to the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Swytch Go only provides one level of assistance as standard, without the controller of the other Swytch kits, which enables you to up the assistance if you want to fly along.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t really an issue for me, and I liked the simplicity of the system in the same way I enjoy jumping on an electric rental bike, such as a Lime bike, and letting it carry me along without much thought.</p>\n<p>The fact you can adjust the assistance on Swytch’s pricier kit makes for a more engaged and arguably more fun ride. However, whether or not this is a concern will depend on what you want from an ebike.</p>\n<p>If you want to really feel and control what’s happening with your bike, you may not think too much about spending the cash on a Swytch Air or Swytch Max.
