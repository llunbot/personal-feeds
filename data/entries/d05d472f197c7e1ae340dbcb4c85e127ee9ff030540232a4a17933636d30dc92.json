The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/when-to-expect-iphone-se-4/\">fourth-generation iPhone SE</a> expected in early 2025 will reportedly also carry 8GB of RAM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe amount of RAM in Apple's devices is currently of increased importance, as Apple has judged that 8GB is the minimum required for the Apple Intelligence features coming in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, which means only the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max of Apple's current phones will support them. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and 15 Plus carry only 6GB of RAM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile a move to 8GB across the board starting with next month's ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup will enable all new iPhones to support Apple Intelligence going forward, a further bump to 12GB would likely allow for even more powerful AI capabilities, but it now appears that may be limited to Apple's highest-end model in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAside from the increased 12GB of RAM, Kuo says the ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro Max will also have an exclusive cooling system combining vapor chamber technology with graphite sheets. The other new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models launching in 2025 will rely solely on graphite sheets for cooling.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/kuo-12gb-ram-iphone-17-pro-max-exclusive/\">Kuo: Next Year's Upgrade to 12GB RAM Will Be Limited to iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-next-years-upgrade-to-12gb-ram-will-be-limited-to-iphone-17-pro-max.2434654/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d05d472f197c7e1ae340dbcb4c85e127ee9ff030540232a4a17933636d30dc92","category":"Apple"}
