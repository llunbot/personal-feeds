Instead of \"Hey Siri,\" users will now simply be able to simply say \"Siri\" to activate the voice assistant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Hey-Siri-vs-Siri.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nAfter activating Siri, users can issue multiple commands in succession without needing to reactivate the assistant, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe shorter \"Siri\" command will be supported on any iPhone and iPad that can run iOS 17 and iPadOS 17. For the Mac and AirPods, however, Apple says the feature will be limited to Macs with Apple silicon and the second-generation AirPods Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe shorter \"Siri\" command is one of several new features introduced across iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma. The software updates will be available as developer betas starting today, and will be publicly released later this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/hey-siri-shortened-to-siri/\">Apple Shortening 'Hey Siri' to 'Siri' Across iPhone, Mac, and Other Devices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shortening-hey-siri-to-siri-across-iphone-mac-and-other-devices.2391641/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"95518cd367050228c47daae77f2c21384968cc0ebdb431263cedaaca97fdf629","category":"Apple"}
