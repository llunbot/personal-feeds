Apple is expected to announce iOS 17 during the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">WWDC 2023 keynote on June 5</a>, and as usual, the first beta version should be made available to developers for testing later that day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe source did not provide any specific details about changes planned for Control Center, which has looked largely the same since iOS 11 was released in 2017. The menu provides iPhone users with convenient access to controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, display brightness, volume, and many other system functions. On the iPhone X and newer, Control Center can be opened by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced with iOS 7, Control Center turns 10 this year. On a speculative basis, Apple could make Control Center more customizable and revamp the menu's design after six years of minimal changes, but exact changes if any remain to be seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the forum member has a proven track record, this rumor has yet to be corroborated by other sources, and Apple's plans are subject to change. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/ios-17-control-center-changes-rumor/\">iOS 17 Rumored to Feature 'Major' Changes to iPhone's Control Center</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-rumored-to-feature-major-changes-to-iphones-control-center.2386000/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"afad623ac20c8aec91e4d60a0d336c0b9ceef6e707a740e9b5d6b61a67fc31d9","category":"Apple"}
