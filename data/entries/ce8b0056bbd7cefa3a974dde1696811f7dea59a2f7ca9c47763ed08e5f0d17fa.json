The series follows eight teams as they tackle the Tour, including the team of the eventual winners of both the yellow and green jerseys, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\">Jumbo-Visma</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crews were given access before, during and after each stage by AG2R-Citroën Team, Alpecin-Fenix, EF Education-EasyPost, Groupama-FDJ, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>, Bora-Hansgrohe, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">QuickStep Alpha Vinyl</a>, so there are some heavy hitters in there, including the yellow jersey winner <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\">Jonas Vingegaard</a> (spoilers). Although the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\">UAE Team Emirates</a> team of defending champion, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, was not involved, there’s always next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

series appears to carry the French title Tour de France: Au Coeur du Peloton and, judging by the preview on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCMtcXpwi_M\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>, it will include a significant volume of subtitled French-language narrative and interviews, however GCN/Eurosport presenter <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/orla-chennaoui-podcast\"

<em>Drive to Survive</em>, which covered Formula 1 racing and was credited with igniting worldwide interest in that sport, so we can maybe hope for a similar boost for bike racing from the new documentary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The early-June release date worldwide is well-timed in the build-up to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">2023 Tour de France</a>, offering armchair <em><a

prepare for the 2023 race, which sets off on 1 July from Bilbao in Northern Spain’s Basque Country and concludes in Paris three weeks later on 23 July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out our <a
