AMD isn't ready to get as specific about its next-generation graphics lineup yet, but the company shared a few morsels today about its next-generation RDNA 4 graphics architecture and its 9000-series graphics cards.</p>\n<p>AMD mentioned that RDNA 4 cards were on track to launch in early 2025 during <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-rdna-4-coming-in-early-2025-set-to-deliver-ray-tracing-improvements-ai-capabilities\">a recent earnings call</a>, acknowledging that shipments of current-generation RX 7000-series cards were already slowing down. CEO Lisa Su said then that the architecture would include \"significantly higher ray-tracing performance\" as well as \"new AI capabilities.\"</p>\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2.jpeg 1920w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-384x216.jpeg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-1152x648.jpeg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-980x551.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RDNA4-4-2-1440x810.jpeg 1440w\" />\n      AMD's RDNA 4 launch will begin with the 9070 XT and 9070, which are both being positioned as upper-midrange GPUs like the RTX 4070 series.\n        Credit:\n          AMD\n      \n<p>The preview the company is providing today provides few details beyond those surface-level proclamations. The compute units will be \"optimized,\" AI compute will be \"supercharged,\" ray-tracing will be \"improved,\" and media encoding quality will be \"better,\" but AMD isn't providing hard numbers for anything at this point. The RDNA 4 launch will begin with the Radeon RX 9070 XT and 9070 at some point in Q1 of 2025, and AMD will provide more information \"later in the quarter.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-promise-to-fix-two-of-amds-biggest-weaknesses/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-promise-to-fix-two-of-amds-biggest-weaknesses/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fdf09422e1c7dee8a6c9da20cb308c0fa175ec9e5a47dac611daa063263e69ae","category":"Tech"}
