Google announced in June 2024 that Chrome OS would begin incorporating portions of Android's technical foundation, but the reported plans go much further toward a complete merger of the two platforms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle is already laying groundwork for the transition by developing a new version of Chrome for Android with extension support and a Terminal application for running Linux apps. The company is also working on improved keyboard, mouse, and external display support for Android, along with features like multiple desktop spaces.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe consolidation aims to create a more unified platform that can better challenge Apple's dominance in the high-end tablet market while allowing Google to more efficiently manage its development resources. Currently, neither Chrome OS nor Android has successfully competed with iPad, despite the multitasking shortcomings of iPadOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report notes that the strategy could also benefit the Android ecosystem by expanding its user base and making it more attractive to developers. Meanwhile, a separate report from <em><a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html\">Android Headlines</a></em> suggests Google is developing a high-end Pixel-branded laptop, which could potentially showcase the new desktop-oriented Android platform.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle has not officially confirmed plans to phase out Chrome OS in favor of Android, and the company declined to comment on the report when contacted by <em>Android Authority</em>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/google-merging-chrome-os-android-rival-ipad/\">Report: Google Merging Chrome OS Into Android to Rival iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-google-merging-chrome-os-into-android-to-rival-ipad.2443414/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec9fa12e273a5d617c255191da01c7fbe5e585427acda7f7c4291ad260b464e0","category":"Apple"}
