{"title":"Gravel World Championships 2024 preview: route and key contenders","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/gravel-world-championships-2024-preview-route-contenders-and-prediction","date":1727971429000,"content":"\n      \n<p><span>This weekend sees the return of one of the fastest growing events in world cycling: the Gravel World Championships.</span></p>\n<p>First introduced, to some controversy, in 2022 with an inaugural event in Veneto, these championships are becoming an increasingly talked about and prominent part of the cycling calendar. This year is set to see them take another step forward in terms of professionalisation, with much more forward planning allowed after the route in Leuven was announced well in advance, compared with the last-minute rushes in the last two years.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>A hybrid between the messy chaos of off-road gravel racing that has been so popular in the USA, and the stricter structure that comes with UCI organisation, these World Championships are like nothing else on the calendar. Many of the biggest names in road cycling will be present, attracted by the prospect of challenging themselves in unfamiliar terrain that not even races like <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/strade-bianche-everything-you-need-to-know?srsltid=AfmBOopamHpynlyVIzq2zrdpeYI0BdNLL828rTVzjR-8vIIt4CR7vXXP\">Strade Bianche</a> or <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-everything-you-need-to-know?srsltid=AfmBOoqsHN-CnrSjFB14zmbPuBsiQ3Dz7Xx8VoDwNDMjqFk_sIg8PLur\">Paris-Roubaix</a> can prepare them for.</p>\n<p>No rain is forecasted for either Saturday’s women’s race or Sunday’s men’s, but this will still be a hugely demanding race set to test road stars in ways they rarely have been in the past. </p>\n<h3><strong>Route</strong></h3>\n<p><span>In a route echoing the European Gravel Championships from last year, the riders will set off from Halle, a small city in Flemish Brabant, and make their way east, passing through the wooded landscape of the Brabantse Wouden National Park. Eventually they will arrive at Leuven (home of the 2021 Road World Championships), where the men will complete two finishing circuits to complete their course of 181km, and the women one lap to finish at 134km.</span></p>\n<p><span>In terms of terrain, there isn’t too much to note. In total there is only about 1,000 metres of elevation gain to navigate, with the route consisting of lots of small, short hills rather than much sustained climbing. Instead of gravity, the real challenge will be the road surfaces. About half of the race takes place on asphalt roads, with a testing mixture of gravel, cobblestones and unpaved roads making up the other half. Mechanicals and crashes will be a constant threat, and bike-handling of paramount importance for anyone wanting to win — plus a reasonable dose of luck.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Contenders </strong></h3>\n<h3><strong><span>Lotte Kopecky </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>On the road, there is little else for serial Classics winner Lotte Kopecky left to conquer, and even on the track she has multiple world titles to her name. But when it comes to gravel racing, the Belgian is a complete novice, having never before competed in one. There are, therefore, doubts as to how well she can adapt to the unique demands, but in theory she should be well-suited to it, given her success at comparable road Classics Paris-Roubaix and Strade Bianche. And her world title on the<a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/this-is-a-win-of-the-head-it-s-lotte-kopecky-s-world\"> road last weekend in Zurich</a> proves she’s in great form, too. </span></p>\n<h3><span><strong>Mathieu van der Poel</strong> </span></h3>\n<p>Just one week after losing his world title on the road, could Mathieu van der Poel compensate by gaining one on the gravel? He’s the standout name on the men’s start list, the one top-tier star who’s trying his hand at the gravel. Third two years ago behind Gianni Vermeersch and Daniel Oss, and having skipped last year’s event, he’s gunning for gold this time, and given his pedigree as an expert bike-handler and unstoppable winning machine in both cyclocross and one-day road Classics, will surely be the man to beat.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"Mathieu van der Poel: Gravel World Champs 2024\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW9_0910.jpg?v=1727966015\" /></div>\n<h3><strong>Puck Pieterse</strong></h3>\n<p>As at the Road World Championships, the Dutch will be the team to beat in the women’s race, featuring some of the same personnel who were left disappointed by their failure to win a medal last weekend in Zurich. One of those riders who might be best positioned to excel on the gravel is Puck Pieterse, given her cyclocross and mountain biking credentials, while her performances on the road this season have been that of a star in the making. Marianne Vos will also line up, bringing her experience and enthusiasm for new additions to the calendar; as are other cyclocross world champions Fem van Empel and Lucinda Brand, while Lorena Wiebes has already proven he can translate her road form to the gravel having earned the European champion title last year.</p>\n<h3><strong> Matej Mohorič</strong></h3>\n<p>Matej Mohorič is serious about defending the gravel world title he won 12 months ago, making this year’s race one of his key targets having enjoyed the experience last time around. His appearances in the Gravel World Series have, however, been minimal, with his road schedule still taking precedence, and he’s had problems the few times he has featured, crashing out of Unbound Gravel in June, and unable to compete in Sea Otter this month due to another crash during the recon. It remains to be seen if he’s recovered in time from the latter, but he’s still eager to compete and replicate <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/a-missed-alarm-a-stupid-attack-and-a-dream-come-true-tadej-pogacar-is-champion-of-the-world\">his compatriot Tadej Pogačar’s success on the road</a> and deliver another Slovenian world title.  </p>\n<div><img alt=\"Matej Mohorič: Gravel World Champs 2024\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TMX07269.jpg?v=1727965814\" /></div>\n<h3><strong>Tiffany Cromwell</strong></h3>\n<p>While this year’s route does appear to play a little more into the hands of the converts from the road rather than the gravel specialists, it’s still true that riders more familiar with these surfaces have an advantage, and therefore, a rider like Tiffany Cromwell could get the better of riders she’s used to trailing on the road. That’s what happened last year when she won the European Championships (even though, as an Australian, the actual title of European champion went to runner-up Lorena Wiebes), and since then, she’s continued to enjoy success in the Gravel World Series, including victory at the recent Sea Otter Girona. </p>\n<h3><strong>Jasper Stuyven</strong></h3>\n<p>The home nation of Belgium is one of the best represented in terms of road WorldTour talent, with the likes of Florian Vermeersch, Tiesj Benoot and Quinten Hermans joining arguably the world’s fastest sprinter, Tim Merlier. But given how the tough nature of the course makes a sprint unlikely, their best hope likely lies with Jasper Stuyven. The 32-year-old has some of the sport’s biggest one-day races on his palmarès, as well as an affinity for gravel surfaces demonstrated by his near-stage winning performance at the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france?srsltid=AfmBOorpjnjVN8QTeQ_fx0g2fepMZ7VqJgL4ayY9A_bBE8833LZapSQv\">Tour de France</a> stage in Troyes this year, and will be an especially dangerous candidate if he can rediscover his form from the spring.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"285e2eca6e96126d7d4d73eb173853bdd18478a38cbad4b48ae72f7d6cb32f10","category":"Cycling"}
