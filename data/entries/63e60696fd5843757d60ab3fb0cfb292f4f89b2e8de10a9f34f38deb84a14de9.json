{"title":"2022 OLED iPad Air in Doubt After Apple Turns Down Samsung's Display Panels","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/oled-ipad-air-samsung-will-not-supply-display/","date":1632904261000,"content":"Apple has called off a joint project with Samsung to use a Samsung-developed OLED display for a forthcoming 10.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, according to a new report today from <em><a href=\"http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3411\">The Elec</a></em>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/OLED-iPad-Air.jpg\" /><blockquote>The project was stopped due to either the single stack structure of OLED panel or profitability issues or both, people familiar with the matter said.</blockquote>Single stack refers to the current widely used OLED panel structure where red, green and blue form one emission layer. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is reportedly not satisfied with the brightness levels of single stack OLED panels and is also wary of the panel's lifespan, since consumers typically hold onto iPads for longer compared to smartphones, which have a more aggressive upgrade cycle. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInstead, Apple wants to use a two-stack tandem structure for its first OLED <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> that stacks two red, green and blue emission layers instead of just one. This doubles the brightness and extends the panel's life by up to four times.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Samsung has only commercialized a single stack structure and is either not able or not willing to supply the two-stack technology, according to the report.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nProfitability is also said to be a factor in Samsung's unwillingness to provide the technology. Unless Samsung can be sure that the OLED ‌iPad Air‌ will be sold for a long time, preparing for the back-end module process for the products won't be worth the cost.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMost of the rumors that we've heard about an OLED ‌‌iPad Air‌‌ suggest that it's coming in 2022. However, now that Samsung isn't involved in development, <em>The Elec</em> suggests the OLED ‌iPad Air‌ will not see the light of day until 2023. A previous report from Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/07/first-oled-ipad-coming-in-2023/\">claimed</a> Apple will release its first OLED ‌iPad‌ in 2023, although no reason was given for the changed production roadmap.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack in March, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple is expected to start using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-oled-ipad-air-in-2022/\">OLED next year</a>, while <em>DigiTimes</em> has also predicted a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/10-9-inch-oled-ipad-early-2022/\">2022 release for an OLED ‌iPad‌</a>, as have sites like <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/31/ipad-models-with-oled-next-year/\">ETNews</a></em>, which rely on supply chain data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOLED technology is expensive, which is a factor that has thus far limited it to smaller devices like iPhones and Apple Watches. When adopted in the ‌‌iPad‌‌, it will bring improved brightness, higher contrast, deeper blacks, and wider viewing angles.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">theelec.kr</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/oled-ipad-air-samsung-will-not-supply-display/\">2022 OLED iPad Air in Doubt After Apple Turns Down Samsung's Display Panels</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2022-oled-ipad-air-in-doubt-after-apple-turns-down-samsungs-display-panels.2314323/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yBe_zhxGKa0:HL3v2CwNa9Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yBe_zhxGKa0:HL3v2CwNa9Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/yBe_zhxGKa0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"63e60696fd5843757d60ab3fb0cfb292f4f89b2e8de10a9f34f38deb84a14de9","category":"Apple"}
