Two builds to satiate the masses, the Process X CR and CR DL, these bikes look almost too good to rally down a mountain. To celebrate the release, we sent out Kona Ambassadors, Scott Mackay, Brian Serneels and Matthew Tounge to shred this bike all over Vancouver’s North Shore.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/redefining-the-process-x-cr-kona-bikes/\">Redefining the Process X CR – Kona Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ad973dbe449fc67effe7891d79c2502028248384bac43d1331b9218d223a73a5","category":"Cycling"}
