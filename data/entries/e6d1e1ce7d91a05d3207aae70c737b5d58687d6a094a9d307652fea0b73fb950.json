His statement is contrary to prior rumors that we've heard about planned changes for the ‌iPhone 17‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnalyst Jeff Pu said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/iphone-17-pro-max-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/\">several times last year</a> that Apple would adopt a \"metalens\" for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> on the ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro, resulting in a \"much narrowed\" ‌Dynamic Island‌, but it sounds like that might not happen after all. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first introduced the ‌Dynamic Island‌ with the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup, and it has changed little since then. There have been persistent rumors suggesting Apple is eventually aiming to have a much smaller cutout that provides more available screen space, but it is not clear Apple will be able to make that hardware change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the ‌iPhone 17‌ models might not get a new look for the ‌Dynamic Island‌, Apple is planning to make other design changes. There will be a super slim \"‌iPhone 17‌ Air\" that features Apple's first redesign in years. Both the ‌iPhone 17‌ Air and the ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro models are rumored to be getting a redesigned horizontal camera setup. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore on what we're expecting for the entire ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">can be found in our iPhone 17 roundup</a>.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/iphone-17-no-dynamic-island-change/\">Kuo: iPhone 17 Models Won't Have Smaller Dynamic Island</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-17-models-wont-have-smaller-dynamic-island.2448047/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e6d1e1ce7d91a05d3207aae70c737b5d58687d6a094a9d307652fea0b73fb950","category":"Apple"}
