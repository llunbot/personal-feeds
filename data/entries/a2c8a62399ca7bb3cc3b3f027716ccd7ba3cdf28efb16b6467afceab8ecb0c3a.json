{"title":"HCP Packer now tracks CI/CD pipeline metadata","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hcp-packer-now-tracks-ci-cd-pipeline-metadata","date":1722873600000,"content":"<p>We are excited to announce the addition of <em>pipeline metadata tracking</em>, now available in <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/packer\">HCP Packer</a>. HCP Packer is a powerful tool that provides image lifecycle management at scale across any cloud and on-premises environments. With this addition, users can now track which CI/CD tools were used in the image-building process through integrations with GitHub and GitLab. This enhancement helps lay the foundation for a secure build pipeline and grants HCP Packer level 1 compliance with <a href=\"https://slsa.dev/\">SLSA</a> (Supply-Chain Levels for Software Artifacts).</p>\n\n<h2>Artifact provenance challenges</h2>\n\n<p>As the security demands on the software supply chain grow, organizations recognize the need for <a href=\"https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/provenance\">provenance</a> of their base images and build artifacts. Artifact provenance includes verifiable information about the creation and configuration of image builds. Without a clear lineage of where, how, and by whom each artifact was built, it can be difficult to verify an artifact's legitimacy and compliance. Organizations must ensure they employ only trusted artifacts, validated at each stage of their lifecycle, to maintain the integrity and security of their software.</p>\n\n<h2>Improving build visibility</h2>\n\n<p>HCP Packer now provides the ability to track pipeline metadata in the artifact registry. This includes critical CI/CD information such as pipeline IDs, job names, details on the operating system, VCS commits, and more. For a full list of the details captured, please refer to the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/packer/reference/build-pipeline-metadata\">build pipeline metadata reference</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This addition grants HCP Packer level 1 SLSA compliance by providing a basic level of source code identification that can help organizations make risk-based security decisions. With this visibility, organizations can shift their security left and address risks earlier in the infrastructure deployment process.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1722615035-screenshot-2024-08-01-at-7-40-07-pm.png\" alt=\"See\" /><p>Pipeline metadata tracking builds on our initiative to enhance metadata visibility within HCP Packer, with recent additions including <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hcp-packer-improves-metadata-visibility-for-artifact-creation\">Packer version and plugin version tracking</a>.
