Ultimately, this can help deduce the genetic relationships between different gut microbes—crucial information for demystifying the complex web of interactions among diet, disease, and microbiome.</p>\n<p>Since launch, over 4 million gamers have played <em>Borderlands Science</em>, collectively solving over 100 million puzzles, making this one of the largest citizen science projects ever. Not only has the game generated huge player engagement, but the results have outperformed state-of-the-art computational methods, according to an analysis of the project published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02175-6%23\">Nature Biotechnology</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022489#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022489&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b735d23e138805c6b4a6a245bf7eec34b42fd2b05f066a26046bad6d4e3d50b8","category":"Tech"}
