{"title":"Panic Launches Playdate Catalog","link":"https://news.play.date/news/catalog-update-1/","date":1678331593000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/really-just-one-color-and-its-yellow\">Speaking of Playdate</a>, Panic has news:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Arriving with the latest Playdate OS and also available at\n<a href=\"https://play.date/games\">play.date/games</a>, Catalog is our curated store for neat\nPlaydate software.</p>\n\n<p>It’s launching with new games, and some previously released\nfavorites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qr1_f-Q8Klw\">Christa Mrgan hosted a fun video</a> with a tour of the new games (and other news — see below). My favorite so far is <a href=\"https://shauninman.com/\">Shaun Inman</a>’s <a href=\"https://play.date/games/word-trip/\">Word Trip</a>, a deviously simple fast-paced word game, and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/carve-jr/\">Carve Jr.</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/skew/\">Skew</a> both look graphically ambitious and fun.</p>\n\n<p>Panic is (finally!) nearing the finish line fulfilling pre-orders, but supply chain costs and inflation have led them to raise the price of a Playdate from $179 to $199 — <a href=\"https://news.play.date/news/april-2023-price/\">but the new price isn’t going into effect until next month</a>. I adore my Playdate (and have lost untold hours in particular to <a href=\"https://play.date/games/zipper/\">Zipper</a>, an extraordinary game by <a href=\"http://www.foddy.net/\">Bennett Foddy</a> in Playdate’s Season One collection). If you’ve been on the fence about buying one, you might as well get it now, at the original price. Then blow the $20 you saved on games in the Catalog.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/playdate-catalog\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d649e5ff321faf8f539727c28b002621fd3539b0004c5b4ff0af1d20095a4b8c","category":"Tech"}
