By pressing \"Erase Device,\" users are prompted to confirm their identity with their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> password, which results in the device being entirely erased and reset.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new option is a welcome addition and a departure from the previous method, which required customers to put their ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ into DFU mode and restore via Finder on the Mac or iTunes on Windows. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne caveat is that under the new method in iOS 15.2, the device must already have an active Wi-Fi or cellular connection before it is locked out. If not, users cannot connect to a network and will be forced to revert to the prior technique. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2 include a host of new features, including a new App Privacy Report, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> Voice Plan, Legacy Contacts, and more.
