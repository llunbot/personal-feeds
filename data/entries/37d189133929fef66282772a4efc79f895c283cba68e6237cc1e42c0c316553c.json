The app will provide subscribers with access to <a href=\"https://www.antstream.com/games\">over 1,300 licensed games</a> from a variety of retro consoles, including the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, SEGA Genesis, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Antstream-Arcade-iPhone-and-Controller-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this year, Apple updated its guidelines to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/\">permit game streaming apps in the App Store</a> worldwide, allowing for a selection of games to be offered within a single app. These services, such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW, were previously only accessible via the web on the iPhone and iPad. Antstream Arcade is set to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183027/antstream-emulator-apple-iphone-retro-games-ipad-streaming\">become the first</a> popular service of its kind to take advantage of the rule change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe primary benefit of Antstream Arcade <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/16/iphone-app-store-emulators-list/\">compared to emulators</a> is that you do not need to provide your own games downloaded from the internet, but this will come at a cost. According <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/retro-videogame-streaming-service-antstream-to-launch-on-the-app-store-next-week/\">to <em>MacStories</em></a>, the service will cost $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year, following limited-time $3.99 per month or $29.99 per year pricing at launch. In addition, Antstream Arcade requires a Wi-Fi or cellular connection to stream games, and the service offers only a handful of games for consoles like the NES, SNES, Game Boy, and PS1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAntstream Arcade is already available on platforms such as Android, Windows, and Xbox.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/antstream-arcade-launching-on-iphone-and-ipad/\">'Antstream Arcade' App With Over 1,300 Retro Games Launching on iPhone and iPad Next Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/antstream-arcade-app-with-over-1-300-retro-games-launching-on-iphone-and-ipad-next-week.2429753/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"37d189133929fef66282772a4efc79f895c283cba68e6237cc1e42c0c316553c","category":"Apple"}
