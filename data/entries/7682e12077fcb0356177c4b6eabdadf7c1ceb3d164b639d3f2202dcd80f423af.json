Upgraded with a tougher plastic mounting bracket, new frame protection, and a more visually-pleasing black wishbone with optional stealth graphics. The changes are subtle. Enough so that you could miss them – outside of the new black color. But version 2.0 is genuinely better. And it’s great to see such a simple, affordable &amp; functional small product be continually refined…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ass Savers Win Wing 2 improved strap-on fender</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves.jpg\" alt=\"Ass Savers Win Wing 2 updated and improved strap-on gravel bike fender, autumn gravel riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_autumn-all-road-fallen-leaves-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple wishbone looped over your tire and strapped to the seatstays, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=ass+savers+win+wing\" target=\"_blank\">Win Wing fender</a> stops mud and water right at the source. Ass Savers call it “tangential coverage”. The Win Wing stops spray at the tire, before it’s thrown towards your… ass.

Effectively with the same amount (weight) of material, the new Ass-Savers Win Wing 2 is more resistant to breaking when it is on or off the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, just because Ass Savers calls it a wishbone, you shouldn’t pull both ends apart and make a wish. Unless your wish is to break a perfectly functional fender. It is tough, but not indestructible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers.jpg\" alt=\"Ass Savers Win Wing 2 updated and improved strap-on gravel bike fender, frame savers stickers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-2-improved-strap-on-fender_frame-savers-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Ass Savers)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tiny update, Ass-Savers now ships the Win Wing 2 with two little clear polyurethane frame-saver stickers.
