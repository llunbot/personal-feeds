Thanks to an improved processor, Google's team found that increasing the number of hardware qubits dedicated to an error-corrected logical qubit led to an exponential increase in performance. By the time the entire 105-qubit processor was dedicated to hosting a single error-corrected qubit, the system was stable for an average of an hour.</p>\n<p>In fact, Google told Ars that errors on this single logical qubit were rare enough that it was difficult to study them. The work provides a significant validation that quantum error correction is likely to be capable of supporting the execution of complex algorithms that might require hours to execute.</p>\n<h2>A new fab</h2>\n<p>Google is making a number of announcements in association with the paper's release (an earlier version of the paper has been <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13687v1\">up on the arXiv</a> since August). One of those is that the company is committed enough to its quantum computing efforts that it has built its own fabrication facility for its superconducting processors.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/google-gets-an-error-corrected-quantum-bit-to-be-stable-for-an-hour/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/google-gets-an-error-corrected-quantum-bit-to-be-stable-for-an-hour/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5767f02b7dfa325aa50e45a0cc4481c42a053a3a9c0829276533cf509495dc6","category":"Tech"}
