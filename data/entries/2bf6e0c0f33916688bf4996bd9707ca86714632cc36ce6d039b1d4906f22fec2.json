It’s the best way to get recently released, high spec bikes for massively discounted prices, while also representing your favourite teams and riders, and there isn’t a better place to do it than Bike-Room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italian brand works directly with all the WorldTour pro teams you see in the Tour de France and beyond, as well as the bike companies themselves to acquire and find homes for previous seasons’ team bikes, and they’re all second, third or fourth bikes, so they haven’t been used and abused. Not only that but all bikes sold on Bike-Room are fully checked over by mechanics, come with a one-year warranty and are shipped worldwide via DHL with super-durable and disguised packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With men’s and women’s team bikes from size XXS all the way up to XXL, there is something for everyone and they’re all at hugely reduced prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New addition: AG2R 2022 BMC Teammachine and Timemachine</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/bike-room-bmc--scaled-e1689151501615-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Bike-Room</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent additions to the Bike-Room fleet are AG2R-Citroën’s 2022 BMC Teammachine and Timemachine bikes, all equipped with Campagnolo Super Record EPS and Campagnolo wheels.
