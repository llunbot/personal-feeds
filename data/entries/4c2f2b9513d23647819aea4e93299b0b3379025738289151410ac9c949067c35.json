Higher-performance Chromebooks can be picked up for around $700, hence the ~$700 figure Apple is targeting, according to the latest rumor.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/apple-rumored-low-cost-macbook-2024/\">Could Apple's Rumored 2024 Budget Mac Be a 12-inch MacBook?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe Naver blog account has a mixed track record for forecasting Apple's plans, but some of its claims last year proved to be significant. For example, in March 2022 it accurately revealed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/iphone-se-rumor-magsafe-battery-life/\">some details</a> about the third-generation iPhone SE ahead of Apple launching the model.
