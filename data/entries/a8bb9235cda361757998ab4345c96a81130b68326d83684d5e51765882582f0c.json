A shallow herringbone tread pattern adds some extra grip on gritty roads.

Instead of the air in your bike’s tyre being held in the inner tube, a tubeless tyre makes an airtight seal with the wheel rim. </span></p>\n<p><span>To do that, the tyre and the rim are made with closer tolerances than a tubed tyre and wheel, and the rim has a tubeless valve screwed into it to make an airtight connection.</span></p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hunt tubeless tape on a Hunt Alloy SL wheel\" title=\"Hunt tubeless tape on a Hunt Alloy SL wheel\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A tubeless setup requires special tape to be wrapped around the rim bed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p><span>The rim also has to be sealed to keep air in. Some are airtight by design, with no spoke holes in the rim bed, others achieve this using an adhesive rim tape applied to the rim bed.</span></p>\n<p><span>To make sure air doesn’t leak, liquid sealant is poured inside the tyre when fitting (or injected through the valve). </span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">Tubeless sealant</a> is designed to seal small gaps between the tyre and rim, and deals with the majority of smaller punctures, healing them as they happen.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tubeless tyre technology is the norm in other tyres, such as those found on cars and most motorcycles.

Butyl inner tubes have the most friction against the tyre; although l</span><span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/latex-tpu-inner-tubes-versus-tubeless/\">atex and TPU inner tubes versus tubeless</a> is a closer contest. </span></p>\n<p><span>With no inner tube at all, and assuming all else is equal, tubeless is usually faster as well as more comfortable to ride. </span></p>\n<h4>Reduced rotating mass</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittoria TPU and latex inner tubes\" title=\"20230822_SvB_X-E3_DSF2221\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> TPU and latex inner tubes can offer similar performance to tubeless but at a higher risk of puncturing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Because you’ve done away with the inner tube, you can save a fair chunk of weight with a tubeless setup in some cases. That’s particularly true with the usual butyl tubes; the weight-saving with latex tubes is less, although latex tubes make up for that by being more fragile and leakier.</span></p>\n<p><span>That saving is countered by the need to add 40ml to 60ml of sealant to your tyre to get a seal and benefit from puncture protection. Also, tubeless-ready tyres are typically heavier than their tubed brethren because they need to be airtight and usually have a heavier-duty bead for safety reasons.</span></p>\n<h4>Increased versatility</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Continental GP5000S TR on Hunt 54 Aerodynamicist wheel\" title=\"20211220_SB_5DSR_MG_4871\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> As road bike tyres have become wider, more riders have been tempted to switch to tubeless.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>As modern <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a> offer ever-increasing tyre clearances, many tubeless tyres are available in widths above the standard 25mm.

Many tubeless tyres can be set up on a wheel just using a track pump, but as tubeless standards for the road are still in flux, some combinations of wheel and tyre just won’t seat while others are excessively tight. You may need to use a tubeless-specific pump with an oversized air chamber, or a separate booster to seat a tyre.</span></p>\n<p><span>The former is a pump where you pressurise a reservoir, then release the air into the tyre. That pushes more air into the tyre at higher pressure and faster, seating the tyre on the rim.</span></p>\n<p>For more, read our detailed guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-set-up-road-tubeless-tyres/\">how to set up road tubeless tyres</a>.</p>\n<h4>Slow leaks</h4>\n<p><span>Once set up, you can often still get slow leaks from a tubeless tyre, due to incomplete sealing to the rim. Spinning the wheel can help distribute the sealant and stop the leak, but, if that doesn’t work, a quick ride up and down the road will often do the trick. </span></p>\n<p><span>You may need to top up the sealant too, if you’ve lost a significant amount.</span></p>\n<h4>Sealant top-ups</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Adding sealant to a tubeless tyre\" title=\"Adding sealant to a tubeless tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’ll need to top up your tyre with sealant from time to time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media </i></span></div>\n<p><span>The sealant in a tubeless tyre tends to dry out and set over time, so you need to keep an eye on whether there’s any liquid sealant still in there.

That usually means popping a tyre bead off the rim so you can see how much liquid sealant is left, adding more sealant if necessary and reseating the tyre. </span><span>Or you can remove the valve core and squirt sealant through it. </span></p>\n<p><span>Both can be slightly messy but </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/tyre-sealant/milkit-tubeless-valve-system-review/\"><span>Milkit</span></a><span> has a system that lets you suck the liquid sealant out of the tyre, measure its volume, top it up and re-add it to the tyre.

Here’s our guide to the key tyre terms you need to know.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bead:</strong> The part on the edge of the tyre that mates with the rim. This is specially made on tubeless tyres to help form an airtight seal and is usually a tighter fit than a non-tubeless tyre bead.</li>\n<li><strong>Casing:</strong> The fabric part of the tyre that supports the rubber tread. In a tubeless tyre, this needs to be airtight to maintain the tyre’s pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Hookless bead:</strong> A spillover from mountain bike wheels, hookless beads remove the lip from the wheel rim. This allows the wheel to be lighter and stronger, while the tyre-rim interface can be more aerodynamically efficient. But some tyre makers advise against fitting their road tyres on hookless rims because there’s less contact with the tyre and a potentially increased risk of the tyre blowing off the rim. It’s best to check manufacturers’ websites for any compatibility issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Removable core:</strong> Many tubeless valves have a removable central core. Take this out and you can get more air into the tyre more quickly to aid inflation. It can also be removed to top up sealant levels if you have a flat or the sealant has dried out.</li>\n<li><strong>Reservoir pump:</strong> A pump that stores up compressed air, which you then discharge into the tyre. The higher volume of air pushed into a tubeless tyre at pressure can make sealing the tyre to the rim easier. You can also buy a separate reservoir that fits between a standard track pump and the tyre valve to achieve the same result.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealant:</strong> Liquid poured into the tyre, typically latex-based, that helps it form an airtight bond to the rim and stop air leaks from minor punctures.</li>\n<li><strong>Sidewall:</strong> The outward-facing edges of the tyre that aren’t in contact with the road surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Track pump:</strong> A long hand-operated pump for tyres. Using a standard <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-track-pumps/\">track pump</a> is often enough to seat a tubeless tyre, although you may need a reservoir pump to get a seal without too much elbow grease.</li>\n<li><strong>Tread:</strong> The rubber compound that forms the outer surface of the tyre on which you ride.</li>\n<li><strong>Tubeless-ready wheel:</strong> You need a tubeless-ready wheelset to set up tubeless tyres on your bike. Most, but not all, newer wheelsets will be tubeless-ready. They’ll be built to tolerances that mean there’s a close fit to tubeless tyres, which should aid installation. But some may need to have tubeless rim tape fitted to set them up for tubeless running.</li>\n<li><strong>Tubeless valve:</strong> Since there’s no inner tube, a tubeless setup has a separate Presta-type valve. This is screwed into the wheel rim before mounting the tyre and has a seal around its base to prevent air loss around the rim’s valve hole.</li>\n<li><strong>UST:</strong> Designation and standard for tubeless tyres and rims used by Mavic. Most Mavic wheels are UST tubeless and the brand recommends its UST tyres for use on its rims. UST is a slightly different standard, although other tubeless tyres should fit okay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a8bb9235cda361757998ab4345c96a81130b68326d83684d5e51765882582f0c","category":"Cycling"}
