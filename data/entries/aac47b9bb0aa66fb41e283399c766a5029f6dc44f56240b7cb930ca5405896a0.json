Officials are contemplating moving the Crew-9 mission from its <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/07/26/nasa-spacex-targeting-aug-18-for-crew-9-mission-to-space-station/\">current date</a> of August 18 to September 24, a significant slip.</p>\n<p>Nominally, this Crew Dragon mission will carry NASA astronauts Zena Cardman, spacecraft commander; Nick Hague, pilot; and Stephanie Wilson, mission specialist; as well as Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, for a six-month journey to the space station. However, NASA has been considering alternatives to the crew lineup—possibly launching with two astronauts instead of four—due to ongoing discussions about the viability of Starliner to safely return astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040999#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040999&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aac47b9bb0aa66fb41e283399c766a5029f6dc44f56240b7cb930ca5405896a0","category":"Tech"}
