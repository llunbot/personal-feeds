This is the first time Vittoria has offered tubeless road tyres with tan-walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsa Pro TLR will be available in sizes from 24mm up to 32mm, while the Corsa Pro Control will be offered in widths from 26mm to 34mm. Both tyres will retail for £89.99 / €94.95.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cotton construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Vittoria</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what’s the big deal? Vittoria says the tyres are made using a new construction technology, with a cotton casing and new compound tread which is now completely seamless because the vulcanisation process is done electrically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vittoria says the 320 TPI cotton casing increases the tyres suppleness and makes it more adaptable to terrain. This is because compared to nylon, cotton is lighter, more flexible and more supple, which the brand claims results in better ground contact, grip and traction.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria-6.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>WorldTour teams including Jumbo-Visma have been using the Corsa Pro tyres</figcaption><figcaption>Vittoria</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The cotton casing is the normal from the Corsa family and usually this casing required the tread to be glued on top,’ explains Vittoria product manager, Tomasso Cappella.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘However now we have developed a new way of doing this, with electrical vulcanization, so there is no gap between the tread and casing, so no glue. The tread and casing are combined together and it creates a fully seamless product.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tyres use Vittoria’s latest Silica and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vittoria-the-future-looks-like-this\" target=\"_blank\">graphene compound</a>, and they also have a high-density layer protection belt before the tread surface and a Zylon bead for easy fitting and air retention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Corsa tread </h2>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/vittoria-tyres-tread.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>The Corsa Pro tread (left) compared to the Corsa Pro Control tread (right)</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsa Pro has spaced grooves for a wide contact surface which Vittoria says is a tried and tested tread pattern used by many cyclists and teams in the WorldTour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsa Pro Control has a new tread design and the tread itself is thicker than the normal Corsa Pro, which the brand says is what makes the tyre ideal for rough terrain, such as cobblestones, and allows it to offer better puncture resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new tread design, which Vittoria calls a fishbone texture, is said to increase handling capability when cornering and the thicker rubber improves puncture resistance and durability. This extra longevity comes at an expense of around 25g in weight: a 28mm Corsa Pro Control weighs a claimed 320g versus a Corsa Pro at 295g in the same size.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\">Are wider tyres faster?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\">Buyer’s guide: The best gravel bike tyres</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\">Best road bike tyres 2023: 10 of the best tyres for all occasions</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Corsa Pro numbers </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/lb-tests-970x510.png\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/lb-tests-970x510.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/lb-tests-300x158.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/lb-tests-768x404.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/lb-tests-750x394.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/lb-tests-1140x600.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/lb-tests.png 1481w\" /><figcaption>According to Vittoria, the Corsa Pro beats its competitors in almost all areas  </figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Vittoria, compared to previous generations the Corsa Pro TLR is 18% more puncture resistant and 12% faster, while the tubular version is 14% faster and offers 7% more puncture resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsa Pro Control is apparently 2% faster and 19% more puncture-resistant than its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vittoria-corsa-control-tyre-review\" target=\"_blank\">predecessor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s like comparing a Fiat Panda and a Porsche 911 when driving at 100kmh,’ explains Cappella.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In one you will feel the speed more, but you will be less in control.

I also found myself agreeing with the ‘Panda vs Porsche’ analogy: despite not feeling like I was going fast, my bike computer said otherwise, and I felt in control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously I can’t quantify many of Vittoria’s empirical claims, and I can’t attest to long term durability as I haven’t ridden them enough, but my first impression was a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More to the Corsa range</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1-970x769.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1-970x769.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1-300x238.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1-768x609.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1-1536x1217.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1-750x594.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1-1140x903.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/corsa-pro-vittoria1-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsa road range includes the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vittoria-corsa-next-review\" target=\"_blank\">Corsa N.EXT</a>, the brands lifestyle option, which was introduced last year.
