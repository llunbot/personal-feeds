[credit:\n                              <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redherring32/status/1528992022551486464\">Redherring32/Twitter</a>\n                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>If you want a portable console that can play old Nintendo Entertainment System games, the easiest option is software emulation, whether you're using Nintendo's official Switch app, a portable PC, or some cheap knockoff emulator handheld. For those who want better accuracy than software emulation can provide, there's always <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/\">the Analogue Pocket</a>, which can (<a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/support/pocket/firmware\">with current firmware</a>) re-create the NES in hardware <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/analogue-pocket-gets-future-minded-fpga-cores-update-with-mister-in-its-sights/\">using its FPGA chip</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But some purists are unsatisfied with anything other than original hardwareâ€”that's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redherring32/status/1647961912661901315\">the only possible explanation</a> for projects like the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redherring32/status/1528992022551486464\">TinyTendo</a>, which goes to extraordinary lengths to squeeze an entire NES into a portable package <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redherring32/status/1529109004986859521\">roughly the size and weight</a> of the old gray monochrome Game Boy. The project is the creation of hardware modder Redherring32, who eventually plans to open-source the project.</p>\n<p>For miniaturization projects like this, you often see chopped-up or fully custom-printed circuit boards used with the original chips to contort the hardware into a new shape. This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=p3Tl4aOVnvo\">landscape orientation mod</a> for the original Game Boy is a good example. But more drastic measures were needed to squeeze an entire NES into a handheld console, most notably the removal of bulky pins and ceramic that the original chips all use.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943997#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943997&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d81d56c20505e4dfb643cfe9aa5d5412cf3c4529eb6cade81b27824fb76a3e91","category":"Tech"}
