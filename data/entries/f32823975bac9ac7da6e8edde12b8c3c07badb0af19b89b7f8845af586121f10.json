Having used it for a few weeks, it seems like a great start, at least for those comfortable with digging into the settings. That's why Home Assistant is calling it a \"Preview Edition.\"</p>\n<p>Using its privacy-minded <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa cloud</a>—or your own capable computer—to handle the processing, the Voice Preview Edition (VPE) ($60/60 euros, available today) has the rough footprint of a modern Apple TV but is thinner. It works similarly to an Amazon Echo, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri device, but with a more focused goal. Start with a wake word—the default, and most well-trained version, is \"Okay, Nabu,\" but \"Hey, Jarvis\" and \"Hey, Mycroft\" are available. Follow that with a command, typically something that targets a smart home device: \"Turn on living room lights,\" \"Set thermostat to 68,\" \"Activate TV time.\" And then, that thing usually happens.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Home Assistant's Voice Preview Edition, doing what it does best. I had to set a weather service to an alias of \"the weather outside\" to get that response worked out.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>\"That thing\" is primarily controlling devices, scenes, and automations around your home, set up in Home Assistant. That means you have to have assigned them a name or alias that you can remember. Coming up with naming schemes is something you end up doing in big-tech smart home systems, too, but it's a bit more important with the VPE.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/home-assistants-voice-preview-edition-is-a-little-box-with-big-privacy-powers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/home-assistants-voice-preview-edition-is-a-little-box-with-big-privacy-powers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f32823975bac9ac7da6e8edde12b8c3c07badb0af19b89b7f8845af586121f10","category":"Tech"}
