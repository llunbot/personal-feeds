The beleaguered department is said to be worried about the potential of upcoming products, while being pressured by a push for cheaper hardware and the impending departure of long-time department head David Limp.</p>\n<p>Reuters' report today cited \"more than 15 current and former employees\" of Amazon's Lab126 for developing hardware. The publication said it was able to uncover five devices Amazon was developing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carbon monoxide detector with Alexa</li>\n<li>Household energy consumption monitor with Alexa</li>\n<li>Digital measuring device with Alexa</li>\n<li>Virus-testing device that was originally \"intended to detect COVID,\" Reuters said</li>\n<li>Home projector</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of Reuters' sources pointed to additional projects, but the publication couldn't verify full details. Amazon says it doesn't comment on products in development.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969299#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969299&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a27a793a171203905f5115a1fee3fe26d570f541f64d8a25858996b2b3869519","category":"Tech"}
