With a single premium Boa dial closure, stiff-enough reinforced nylon sole, and simple good looks, the Fizik Omna Wide is a great shoe for those roadies looking to rack up the miles, but who aren’t comfortable in overly narrow Italian road kicks…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fizik Vento Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_classic-black.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_classic-black.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_classic-black-297x161.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_classic-black-800x433.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_classic-black-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_classic-black-768x416.jpg 768w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photos/Fizik)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, black\" /><figcaption>(Photos/Fizik)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, black\" /><figcaption>(Photos/Fizik)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While much of the road shoe chatter goes to top-tier ultralight, ultra-stiff roadie slippers, many road riders simply aren’t too comfy in overly narrow, unforgiving shoes. And that’s where Fizik’s new Omna Wide comes in (<em>and really, the original narrower Omna still, too</em>). These are no-nonsense performance road shoes that don’t skimp on the important details AND won’t break the bank. Plus, the new Wide last option simply means more cyclists are going to find their perfect fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1100\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_top-in-black-or-white.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, top in black or white\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_top-in-black-or-white.jpg 1100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_top-in-black-or-white-297x176.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_top-in-black-or-white-800x473.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_top-in-black-or-white-120x71.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_top-in-black-or-white-768x454.jpg 768w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, top in black or white\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, top in black or white\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fizik developed the Omna Wide to deliver the “<em>optimal fit for riders with wider feet, with a higher volume forefoot area being introduced around the ball of the foot and metatarsals</em>”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not a huge width difference, really we’re talking &lt;10% overall. But on my size 43 shoe for example, the Wide last could be about 102mm at its widest point vs. ~94mm for the standard fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Omna shoes feature a simple, light &amp; durable synthetic polyurethane upper, perforated through the midfoot for ventilation. Then, closure and fine-tuned adjustment is by a single premium Boa Li2 dial with 2-cross lacing in webbing loops. No plastic guides to break.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1100\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_nylon-sole.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, R5 nylon sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_nylon-sole.jpg 1100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_nylon-sole-297x135.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_nylon-sole-800x364.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_nylon-sole-120x55.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_nylon-sole-768x349.jpg 768w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, R5 nylon sole\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, R5 nylon sole\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fizik recently redesigned the sole, their vented R5 reinforced nylon outsole with non-replaceable rubber walking lugs, and a stiffness rating of 6/12. That sounds a bit low on paper. But is probably plenty stiff for all but the most sensitive or most competitive road racers. The new sole has slightly shifted the cleat bolts back for improved pedaling ergonomics. And of course, your cleats have plenty of adjustment, so the shoes get 2cm of marking to help line them up where you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claimed Fizik Omna Wide weight is 240g (per shoe, without the 20g insole).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fizik Omna Wide – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_angled-white.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Omna Wide affordable road bike shoes, on-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_angled-white.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_angled-white-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_angled-white-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_angled-white-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_angled-white-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Omna-Wide-affordable-road-bike-shoes_angled-white-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Fizik Vento Omna Wide road shoes sell for 165€ / £170 /$170, and come in all-black or white with black detailing.
