{"title":"A Defense of the Safari 15 Redesigns","link":"https://www.craft.do/s/xhSQPGTqNtDt4I","date":1626722760000,"content":"\n<p>Jeff Kirvin, in an essay titled “Safari 15 Isn’t Bad, Just Misunderstood”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So what do we have? A new browser UI that shows as much of the\npage as possible when the user is interacting with the page, and\nsurfaces UI chrome only when the user indicates that they need to\ninteract with the UI. Adaptive and contextual. This, Federico, is\nwhy Apple declared war on buttons. You should only see a button\nwhen you need it. The rest of the time you should see as much of\nyour content as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a general sense of “<em>everyone dislikes the new Safari designs</em>” and I know that’s not true, even though public sentiment is strongly against them. So even though I don’t find Kirvin’s arguments compelling, I thought it was worth linking to them, because I do think he explains what the designers of the new Safari UIs were shooting for. Content-first; hide more of the browser chrome. I stand by <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/07/safari_15_public_betas_for_mac_and_ios\">my take</a> though, that they threw the baby out with the bathwater — the tradeoffs aren’t worth it. It’s good for web browsers to default to minimal browser chrome, but the chrome that is displayed should look like chrome, not part of the page. The web page and the web browser are two very different things, and the way they look should make that obvious — not obfuscate it. The Safari 15 UIs shown at WWDC are show-y off-y designs that solve problems that don’t really exist in the practical world. Across all three platforms — iPhone, iPad, and Mac — Safari’s previous (that is to say current, non-beta) designs devote as much screen space to showing page content as anyone could want while still exposing the most-used browser controls.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/19/kirvin-safari-15-defense\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"60b7fade55d78c905e451328e75262da4cd3bb9cb36c042867a662d68fd9211c","category":"Tech"}
