It feels like the worst thing in the world, but it’s also pretty avoidable with a little help from good ol’ technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack&amp;utm_term=scsf-614276&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003GW0bIAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> KeySmart SmartCard</a> is kind of like an AirTag that got pancaked into the shape of a credit card. It’s razor thin, works with the Apple Find My app, and a pack of three of them is on sale for $79.97 (instead of $119). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how it works: add the SmartCard to your Find My app to unlock features like sound alerts to help you track it down nearby or location updates from the Apple network. Worried about leaving your wallet in a restaurant or stepping out the door without it? No worries. The app sends notifications straight to your iPhone or even your AirPods. And if it’s truly lost, Lost Mode allows anyone who finds it to contact you, giving you peace of mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At just under 2mm thick, the KeySmart SmartCard slides effortlessly into your wallet without adding bulk. It’s also built to last with a five-month battery life, Qi wireless charging, and an IPX8 waterproof rating, making it perfect for anyone on the go. Whether you’re trekking through the rain, heading into the office, or just trying to keep your life together, this card has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why would you need three of them if you only have one wallet? Well, you aren’t limited to just wallets with these trackers. Slip one into your backpack, computer case, purse, or even hide one on your e-bike. Because they’re so thin, they’re really easy to tuck almost anywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have until March 31 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get a<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack&amp;utm_term=scsf-614276&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003GW0bIAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> three-pack of KeySmart® SmartCards</a> on sale for $79.97. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack&amp;utm_term=scsf-614276&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003GW0bIAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp3.stackassets.com/30644d470bba17773208d4bda81f61242ed193a6/store/97d5d7148153ca59f9abb67fe20bc0bc029468892151d4d85a2a4e7487b7/product_xxxxx_product_shots1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>KeySmart® SmartCard – Works with Apple Find My (3-Pack) – $79.97</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=keysmart-smartcard-works-with-apple-find-my-app-wireless-charging-3-pack&amp;utm_term=scsf-614276&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003GW0bIAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0719247c1f155d6b04f27c330b7bba4a58e55f17c936e8afb731101809f6f54e","category":"Apple"}
