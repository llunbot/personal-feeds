As a result, Spotify cannot be controlled with Siri on the HomePod.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" />\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman touched on the matter <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-02/when-is-apple-aapl-announcing-its-mixed-reality-headset-june-5-at-wwdc-2023-lfzggfhe\">in his newsletter</a> this weekend, noting that Spotify told him there hasn't been a \"significant volume\" of complaints about the lack of HomePod support. A post <a href=\"https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/iOS-Implement-Native-HomePod-Support/idi-p/4985214\">on Spotify's community website</a> advocating for native HomePod support has over 5,800 votes in favor of the idea since it was submitted in 2020, but Spotify has refused to budge despite Apple making the necessary APIs available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2019, Spotify <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/\">accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior</a> in a complaint filed in the EU. Alongside the complaint, Spotify launched a <a href=\"https://www.timetoplayfair.com/timeline/\">\"Time to Play Fair\" website</a> that lists alleged examples of Apple's unfair practices, including preventing Spotify from natively supporting the HomePod. Yet, nearly three years after Spotify has been able to support the HomePod without any further action from Apple, it has yet to follow through.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpotify has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/25/spotify-still-doesnt-support-airplay-2/\">repeatedly promised</a> to update its iPhone and iPad app with AirPlay 2 support, but it has failed to deliver so far. AirPlay 2 launched in 2018 with enhancements to the original AirPlay protocol, including multi-room audio and improved buffering.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpotify told Gurman that it \"remains committed to supporting AirPlay 2 at some point in the future\" and is \"on a path towards making it happen eventually,\" but the company was unable to provide a definitive timeframe. Spotify has been promising to support AirPlay 2 since at least 2021, so subscribers have waited a long time.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay-2/\">AirPlay 2</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/02/spotify-downplays-homepod-support/\">Spotify Downplays HomePod Support, But Promises to Add AirPlay 2 Yet Again</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-downplays-homepod-support-but-promises-to-add-airplay-2-yet-again.2385671/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a850e18ace47a3f1aab2dc3a1a36ec06e93827342c9e351acbc76632602edada","category":"Apple"}
