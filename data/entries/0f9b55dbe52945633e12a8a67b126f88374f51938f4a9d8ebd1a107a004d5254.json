That new 14-inch MacBook Pro is totally replacing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/13-inch-macbook-pro-review-apples-m2-is-a-worthy-follow-up-to-the-m1/\">the old 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> in Apple's lineup.</p>\n<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro still used the same basic design that Apple had been using since 2016, when Apple redesigned the MacBook Pros to make them thinner and lighter and to replace all of their ports with Thunderbolt. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros backtracked on several of those design decisions, but the 13-inch model stayed as it was, complete with the regular notchless display and the Touch Bar.</p>\n<p>This effectively means that the MacBook Pro is getting a price increase from $1,299 to $1,599. But the $1,599 Pro includes many features that were never included in the 13-inch Pro, including the larger high-refresh-rate ProMotion display, the contrast-boosting and bloom-reducing mini LED screen technology, the MagSafe connector, the 1080p camera, and the return of the HDMI port. Apple also now sells <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/review-apples-15-inch-macbook-air-says-what-it-is-and-is-what-it-says/\">a 15-inch MacBook Air</a> at that $1,299 starting point, giving people another option in between the mainstream 13-inch Air and the Pro lineup.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979621#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979621&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0f9b55dbe52945633e12a8a67b126f88374f51938f4a9d8ebd1a107a004d5254","category":"Tech"}
