The tweet included a screenshot of CBC's Twitter profile with the new \"69% Government-funded Media\" label.</p>\n<p>The \"69% Government-funded\" label, while obviously a <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/69-sixty-nine\">joke</a>, appears to be inaccurate. The CBC may not have told Musk the exact percentage, but the organization's publicly available <a href=\"https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/impact-and-accountability/finances/annual-reports/ar-2021-2022/financial-sustainability/revenue-and-other-funds\">2022 financial report</a> says it received $1.24 billion in government funding and another $651.4 million in revenue from advertising, subscriber fees, and investments. That would mean government allocations accounted for about 66 percent of the CBC's 2022 funding and revenue.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932726#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73d2f2383a1db7463e11baccc9b689e68f76c08a0be326efc0eb51d8f9e4591f","category":"Tech"}
