Starlink operator SpaceX began \"a one-year assessment period to offer residential satellite Internet service to 99.5% of residents within the NRQZ starting October 25,\" the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Green Bank Observatory <a href=\"https://public.nrao.edu/news/over-99-5-of-residents-in-the-national-radio-quiet-zone-can-now-receive-satellite-internet-service/\">announced last week</a>.</p>\n<p>\"The vast majority of people within the areas of Virginia and West Virginia collectively known as the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) can now receive high speed satellite Internet service,\" the announcement said. \"The newly available service is the result of a nearly three-year collaborative engineering effort between the US National Science Foundation (NSF), SpaceX, and the NSF National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NSF NRAO), which operates the NSF Green Bank Observatory (NSF GBO) in West Virginia within the NRQZ.\"</p>\n<p>There's a controversy over the 0.5 percent of residents who aren't included and are said to be newly blocked from using the <a href=\"https://www.starlink.com/us/roam\">Starlink Roam</a> service. Starlink markets Roam as a service for people to use while traveling, not as a fixed home Internet service.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/starlink-enters-national-radio-quiet-zone-but-reportedly-cut-off-access-for-some/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/starlink-enters-national-radio-quiet-zone-but-reportedly-cut-off-access-for-some/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"446beb4b23c544b72d62890f4eab095ccbe3d22ad76fceda7af3b35541fe83ce","category":"Tech"}
