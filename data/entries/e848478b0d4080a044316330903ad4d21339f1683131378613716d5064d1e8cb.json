Because of its clement Mediterranean climate, it’s a destination that cyclists can enjoy all year round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Akra Hotels, with locations dotted across this hugely varied country, are riding the same wave of cycling enthusiasm, with bike-friendly accommodation that can provide the ideal base for training groups, families and every kind of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When staying in an Akra hotel, every element of your cycling holiday is taken care of, with a range of facilities on hand to keep you well rested, fully prepared and ready to roll, whenever the time comes. Eat, Sleep, Cycle, Repeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turkey has recently launched a Bike Friendly Accommodation certificate to accredit facilities that deliver the highest accommodation standards specifically for cyclists. This includes maintaining top-tier cycling facilities and employing well-trained and knowledgeable staff who can provide useful cycling information alongside cultural and historical colour for curious visitors. All three of the Akra hotels detailed below have obtained this certificate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Akra hotels provide</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-728x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-1140x1520.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bike-Friendly-scaled.webp 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Rental and maintenance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akra hotels offer bicycle repair shops equipped with a full range of tools freely available for you to use whenever you need. Some hotels also offer the support of a trained on-site mechanic, and a range of accessories and parts – whether it’s a brake cable or a set of patches – is available to purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be for your own bike if you choose to bring it with you – and Akra can help arrange airport transfers if you do – though you might want to take advantage of the in-house rental service, where there is a good range of mountain and road bikes on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cleaning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At Akra hotels there is also a dedicated space for bike cleaning, complete with all the necessary equipment and fluids – but if you’d rather not clean it yourself, some locations offer a bike-washing service. Helpfully, there is also a laundry service and dedicated areas for drying kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Varied exercise equipment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re off the bike, the availability of various exercise equipment is another useful option. Whether you’re taking a recovery dip in the pool or doing warm-ups in the spinning studio, there will be no shortage of exercise options when you’re not out riding. And that’s before considering the array of saunas, massage rooms and spa services provided by Akra hotels, meaning you can recover from your rides like a pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nutrition</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Diet is key to maximising performance on the bike, and food is clearly a key component of any great holiday. Akra’s hotels curate special menus led by trained dieticians to provide the necessary fuel for hard days in the saddle. Lunch boxes for eating on the go can be provided on request, and gels and energy bars are available for purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wave goodbye to awkwardly hoiking your bike into the lift or up the stairs, as secure bicycle storage is provided at Akra Hotels. Monitored 24/7, your bikes are in safe hands at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Routes and planning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering where to ride? There is no shortage of options when you’re staying at an Akra hotel. Perfectly positioned in areas of outstanding natural beauty, the only problem you’ll have will be picking which fantastic route you opt for each day. Hotel staff can help you decide on a route, or a professional guide can be arranged to provide on-hand support for the entirety of your rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Visiting Akra hotels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of Akra’s hotels – Akra Antalya, Akra Kemer and Akra Sorgun – are located in the Turquoise coast region of southwestern Turkey, known for its fantastic climate, varied topography, proximity to ancient cities, and crystal clear waters. The only real decision is which one of them to choose for your dream cycling holiday, because when you stay with Akra, it’s simple to Eat, Sleep, Cycle, Repeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Akra Antalya</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-970x646.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/1.Akra-Antalya-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All-inclusive five-star hotel Akra Antalya is a coastal resort in southwestern Turkey, just 15km from Antalya airport, that boasts almost 500 rooms and has its own 100-metre platform beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the city of Antalya is on the doorstep, the surrounding landscape is begging to be explored. The fact it hosts the Tour of Antalya pro race every year, as well as a gran fondo, tells you everything about the visual appeal of the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dramatic Düden Waterfalls, located on the shoreline, are just 12km away and can be included in a number of different loops. Other nearby gems include the panoramic viewpoint from Konyaaltı Varyant, the Belek Ancient City of Aspendos and the Lara Beaches, perfect for soaking up the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those looking for something more challenging, heading out into the Feslikan Hills is a big day out on the bike that will take you through some unbelievable scenery. Rugged outcrops of rock tower above thick forests, with a sliver of tarmac on offer to winch you up above the clouds. With over 2,000m of climbing in just under 100km, this is not for the faint of heart!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facilities: </strong>Road and mountain bike rental, route transport, professional tour guide, secure bike storage, training equipment, repair shop, mechanical support, cyclist menus, bike washing area, route info, e-bike charging, shopping, training equipment, spa and wellness centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Akra Kemer</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-728x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-1140x1520.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/2.Akra-Kemer-scaled.webp 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Located just down the coast from Akra Antalya, all-inclusive five-star hotel Akra Kemer also looks out over the Mediterranean sea and is similarly well-placed for all kinds of cycling adventures. It’s 55km from Antalya airport, has 360 rooms and its own 120m private beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kemer is a smaller, quieter town than Antalya, and backs onto the Olympos Beydağları National Park and Tahtali mountain, a 2,366m peak that is possible to visit by cable car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of cultural and historical landmarks, if you stay at Akra Kemer you will be absolutely spoiled for choice. As well as the ancient city of Olympus (43km) and the canoe-navigable Göynük Canyon (11km), there are brilliant routes out through the adjoining national park, where riders can cherry pick routes perfectly suited to different abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Road and mountain bike rental, route transport, professional tour guide, secure bike storage, repair shop, bike and clothes washing, mechanical support, cyclist menus, route info, shopping, training equipment, spa and wellness centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Akra Sorgun</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-970x646.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/3.Akra-Sorgun-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further west round the bay lies Akra Sorgun, a 336-room all-inclusive five-star hotel just outside the riverfront city of Manavgat, which is a 67km drive from Antalya airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Altınbeşik Mağarası Milli Parkı is around 50km north of Manavgat, and the surrounding area is a playground for both road, gravel and mountain bike riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole area is renowned for its waterfalls, and Akra Sorgun is no different. The Manavgat waterfalls are just 20km away and can be fitted into a variety of different riding loops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bigger rides take in the Köprülü Kanyon, another brilliant canoeing spot, the ancient city of Side complete with an incredible amphitheatre, and the colossal Oymapınar Dam which is the fifth biggest dam in Turkey. Or if it’s hills you’re after, the long climb to Gündogmuş – in the foothills of Geyik mountain – is part of a 142km loop with almost 3,000m of climbing and has some phenomenal scenery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Secure bike storage, repair shop, bike and clothes washing, mechanical support, e-bike charging, cyclist menus, route info, shopping, spa and wellness centre.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/babadag-turkey-cycling\">Big Ride: Turkey’s giant killer</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/turkish-alpe-cycling\">Big Ride: The Turkish Alpe</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-eurasia-turkish-delight-caucasus-might\">Cycling Eurasia : Turkish delight, Caucasus might</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/akra-hotels-turkey-cycling-holiday\">Choose Akra Hotels for the ultimate cycling holiday in Turkey</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e848478b0d4080a044316330903ad4d21339f1683131378613716d5064d1e8cb","category":"Cycling"}
