Not just the terror of an overwhelming mass of dark energy encroaching on your fortress, which is what the story suggests. Moreso, the terror of hoping your little computer-controlled fighters will do the smart thing, then being forced to watch, helpless, as they are consumed by algorithmic choices, bad luck, your strategies, or some combination of all three.</p>\n<p><em>Shadowveil,</em> the first video game based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings\">more than 30-year-old <em>Legend of the Five Rings </em>fantasy franchise</a>, is a roguelite auto-battler. You pick your Crab Clan hero (berserker hammer-wielder or tactical support type), train up some soldiers, and assign all of them abilities, items, and buffs you earn as you go. When battle starts, you choose which hex to start your fighters on, double-check your load-outs, then click to start and watch what happens. You win and march on, or you lose and regroup at base camp, buying some upgrades with your last run's goods.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      <em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em> launch trailer.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In my impressions after roughly seven hours of playing, <em>Shadowveil </em>could do more to soften its learning curve, but it presents a mostly satisfying mix of overwhelming odds and achievement. What's irksome now could get patched, and what's already there is intriguing, especially for the price.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/shadowveil-is-a-stylish-tough-single-player-auto-battler/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/shadowveil-is-a-stylish-tough-single-player-auto-battler/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6eb208d2bffe77c7e43123a90185a7582aee9cd9474fc069a63c97eb588e9244","category":"Tech"}
