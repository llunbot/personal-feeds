The graphic Apple is using for the event reflects the shining outline of the Apple logo seen in the event invite, and you can use AR to tunnel through it, where a starry night lake scene and the event date are revealed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple often creates graphical experiences for its events, with AR being at the center of recent efforts. In the past, it also had an October iPad event where it created dozens of different Apple logos, and people often analyze event art designs to decipher possible signs of what to expect when it comes to product announcements.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>We‚Äôre California Streaming on September 14th.
