Each proposing company must procure its own rocket for a demonstration mission.</p>\n<p>Less than a week later, on May 16, the China Manned Space Engineering Office <a href=\"http://www.cmse.gov.cn/gfgg/202305/t20230515_53551.html\">announced</a> a \"Low-cost Cargo Transportation System\" plan to hire private companies to deliver cargo to its Tiangong space station. Eligible providers must be capable of delivering at least 1.8 tons to low-Earth orbit. The Chinese spacecraft do not need to return cargo but should be able to dispose of 2 metric tons. The Chinese space agency said it would pay no more than $17.2 million per ton of cargo delivered.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944517#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944517&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c1fac8d2d35b1ef15c0e634486d3882383bf30da85d2c60db43dfdd395765e8","category":"Tech"}
