The change began on June 1, after Meta delayed it from an original planned date of May 5.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nWhatsApp is no longer compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service through the app unless they upgrade their iPhone. Alternatively, users can visit web.whatsapp.com in their browser, but the experience won't be the same.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature. Instructions on how to do so are outlined in WhatsApp's <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/209942271778103/?cms_platform=iphone&amp;helpref=platform_switcher\">Help Center</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn related developments, WhatsApp is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/whatsapp-for-ipad-now-available/\">now available on the iPad</a>, coming more than 15 years after the messaging service launched.
