{"title":"Apple’s Satellite Networking Ambitions","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-satellite-ambitions-threatened-elon-musk-internal-resistance?rc=jfy0lk","date":1748382763000,"content":"\n<p>Aaron “Homeboy” Tilley (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/wsj-tech-layoffs\">recently of the WSJ</a>) and Wayne Ma, at the paywalled-up-the-wazoo The Information:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Starting in 2015, Apple and Boeing held early discussions about a\nsatellite internet project that would involve delivering\nfull-blown wireless internet service, not just emergency\ncommunications services, to iPhones and homes, said five people\ninvolved in or briefed on the project.</p>\n\n<p>Through the effort, dubbed Project Eagle within Apple, the\ncompanies would lob thousands of Boeing satellites into orbit to\nbeam internet down to iPhones. For home users, Apple planned to\noffer antennas people could stick to their windows to disperse\ntheir internet connection throughout the building. (Satellite\ninternet requires a device to have an uninterrupted line of sight\nto the sky.)</p>\n\n<p>For the project’s champions, it was an ambitious gambit to provide\na more seamless Apple experience. Some inside Apple saw mobile\ncarriers as necessary but inconvenient partners that held the\ncompany’s iPhone plans back. With a global satellite system, Apple\ncould provide more of the key ingredients for its products,\nreducing its dependency on outside partners.</p>\n\n<p>The lead executive and architect behind the project was Apple’s\nlongtime wireless chief, Rubén Caballero. Apple spent around $36\nmillion testing out the concept at a secret location in El\nSegundo, Calif., the people with knowledge of the project said.\nThe team aimed to launch the service in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>But eventually Apple got cold feet. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, was\nconcerned that the project would jeopardize the company’s\nrelationship with the telecom industry, said people with direct\nknowledge of the project. It was also an expensive undertaking\nwith an unclear near-term business case. At the end of 2016, Apple\ncanceled the project. (Caballero <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-executive-responsible-for-5g-efforts-departs\">left the company</a> in 2019.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The segment I quote here is midway through the article. It leads with purported offers from Elon Musk to Apple to rely exclusively on Starlink for satellite networking. Starlink offers a <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonfried/status/1873056615345340566\">genuinely incredible service</a>. But there’s no way Apple was going to make a <em>get into bed together</em> deal with Elon Musk. Starlink’s technology and satellite coverage are extraordinary, but Musk personally is just too erratic. It’s a bizarre, dare I say unprecedented, combination. He’s like Howard Hughes but with much better tech (and, perhaps, fewer bottles of his own urine strewn about his bedroom).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/27/apples-satellite-networking-ambitions\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d0e3e21f7c1542c70c3fde6294a2894206ed47086d4cdcf987002e7e92687ea9","category":"Tech"}
