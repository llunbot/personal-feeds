Apple has used the woven descriptor in the past for Apple Watch bands, though, so something with woven is not out of the question. Case images leaked earlier this week do appear to have a woven fabric texture that's perhaps not too far off from suede.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iphone-15-alternative-leather-case.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nWhile it continues to be unclear if this \"FineWoven\" material is what we'll actually see on September 12, what seems to be certain is that leather is being eliminated. In addition to multiple reports from leakers who often share accurate information about Apple's plans, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-30/apple-watch-series-9-apple-tests-3d-printing-in-device-production\">today confirmed</a> that Apple is using \"new materials\" to replace leather.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been offering leather cases since the launch of the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 5s, with the leather option sold alongside silicone cases. With Apple's focus on improving its carbon footprint, it makes some sense that the company would eliminate leather.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA leather alternative that is fabric-based would have a smaller carbon footprint than a case made from traditional cowhide, and it would be more environmentally friendly. Leather alternatives have been growing in popularity over the last several years, and there are now many high-quality plant-based options that companies have adopted.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/iphone-15-finewoven-case-rumors/\">Questionable Rumor Says iPhone 15's New Leather Alternative Case is Called 'FineWoven'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/questionable-rumor-says-iphone-15s-new-leather-alternative-case-is-called-finewoven.2400079/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f1fdad7c1aafad191c39003a981011501ead3e82f18167a091b8a240d97eb4c7","category":"Apple"}
