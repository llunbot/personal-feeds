{"title":"Patrick McGee on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAj9zB4vaZc","date":1747949098000,"content":"\n<p>The Daily Show:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Award-winning journalist Patrick McGee joins Jon Stewart to\ndiscuss how Apple built China in his new book <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/56320/9781668053379\">Apple in China</a>: The\nCapture of the World’s Greatest Company</em>. They talk about Apple\n“sleepwalking” into this crisis, building a competitive market in\nXi Jinping’s authoritarian state, the vocational training that\nboosted rivals, how Trump’s attempted Apple boycott backfired, and\nwhether investments may be facilitating the annexation of Taiwan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Terrific interview. I’m a few chapters into the book, and it’s good. McGee’s a good writer and a serious reporter — the depth of his research shows. It feels not like a few stories padded out to book length, but instead the distillation of a complex story that demands an entire book to tell.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/mcgee-daily-show\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ac63ba429805470154f00f1c751a36583bf613e6b2c0deb9d348d65a4476c6d9","category":"Tech"}
