In the shadow of a hut in the grounds of the Bahamian penthouse they and others shared, he asked the crypto tycoon: “Are we OK?”</p>\n<p>Yedidia told a New York court this month that he was worried FTX, the crypto exchange that Bankman-Fried had co-founded and at that time led, was in financial trouble. He recounted his old friend’s reply: “We were bulletproof last year, but we’re not bulletproof this year.”</p>\n<p>FTX collapsed a few months later, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry. US prosecutors hope this chat, which they have taken to calling the “bulletproof conversation,” will help to show Bankman-Fried knew about, and concealed, an $8 billion cash shortfall for months at least before it was exposed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978424#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978424&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0d071fefce94b8ae16436d09b519fd04e7c54a86adc559f47da5af3329552087","category":"Tech"}
