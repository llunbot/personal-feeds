In keeping with rumors, it shows flat edges, a mute switch, and no Touch ID button but rather a full edge-to-edge display, likely with larger bezels than the current iPhones. However, we don’t get a good enough look at the top of the front of the dummy to see what kind of cutout Apple will use for the camera. We expect an iPhone 14-era TrueDepth module for Face ID, with a relatively large notch rather than a Dynamic Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with just one lens, the camera on the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be a huge upgrade over the current 12MP wide-angle one. Rumors say it will get a boost to 48MP with night mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dummy models, as they are called, are finished but non-functioning phones used for things like testing cases and such. They often feature accurate designs and even materials, but they don’t have working parts inside. Dickson has a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2429414/leaker-shows-off-the-four-new-iphone-16-pro-colors.html\">strong</a> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2414097/iphone-16-leak-design-colors-white-black-blue-green-pink.html\">history</a> of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676657/photos-reveal-new-ipad-pro-design.html\">accurate leaks</a> involving iPhone and iPad dummy units. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to launch the new iPhone SE at a spring event in March or April, and it will be a big update over the existing model. A key feature will be the upgrade to the A18 processor and 8GB of RAM, which will allow it to support Apple Intelligence.  Some rumors have suggested Apple will even change the name, calling it the iPhone 16E.
