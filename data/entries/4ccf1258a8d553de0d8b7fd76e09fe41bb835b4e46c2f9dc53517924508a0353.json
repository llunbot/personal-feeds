They need to fit in a way that’s comfortable for long periods but also secure so there’s no foot movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They need to efficiently transfer the rider’s efforts into the drivetrain, which means a rock-solid sole with plenty of cleat positioning flexibility to cater to different pedal setups. They need to keep feet protected but also provide ventilation on hot days. They need to be light. And, of course, they need to look great.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"737\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-02-970x737.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-02-970x737.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-02-300x228.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-02-768x584.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-02-750x570.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-02-1140x866.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A bad pair of shoes can break a ride.

It’s unique in Ekoï’s range – only used on this flagship design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘3K woven carbon composite, shaped to both enhance stiffness and mirror the curvature of the foot, was used to create a lightweight but rigid platform,’ says Alexis. ‘Knowing that attention to detail is key, we have inscribed a detailed grid system over the cleat mounts to ensure precise and repeatable cleat positioning.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-05-ekoi.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the base of the shoe is all about efficiency, the upper’s priority is comfort and security, says Alexis: ‘Unlike many competitors who opt for synthetic fabrics, we’ve used natural leather for the upper. Arranged in a wrap design as it is, where the inside half of the upper overlaps the outside half as it is tightened, the upper will enclose the foot equally, fitting like a second skin.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Ortholite X40 foam insole supports the upper in this regard, helping with vibration absorption and breathability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That said, natural leather breathes well anyway,’ says Alexis. ‘Plus, it moulds to the rider’s feet over time, so the shoe should only get more comfortable the longer it’s worn.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sidi Ergo 6</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"771\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-06-sidi-970x771.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-06-sidi-970x771.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-06-sidi-300x238.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-06-sidi-768x611.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-06-sidi-750x596.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-06-sidi-1140x906.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-06-sidi.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>£299, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/sidi-ergo-6-road-shoes-matte-colours?srsltid=AfmBOopu--jqftXLAZcqco-TVUyrfAf64fzQHGi6Vm4k2zfbzXh4VRxN\" target=\"_blank\">saddleback.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 1960, Italian brand Sidi is a pioneer in road cycling shoes, but with a recent change of management has come a new direction for its performance race shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The new owners have come in and taken feedback from the general public, athletes and bike-fitters,’ says Sidi brand manager George Wise. ‘They already had the heritage, quality and performance, now they just needed to look at the aesthetic, the weight and the fit.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is the Ergo 6, which looks radically different to the brand’s usual offerings. Its shoes have traditionally been fairly built up with panels, straps and chunky attachments. The Ergo 6, by contrast, is stripped back and refined, handmade in Italy using artisan skills to create a shoe that is understated but no less technically advanced.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-07-sidi.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s about £100 less than our Shot and Wire shoes, but the Ergo 6 is still an incredible race shoe,’ says Wise. ‘It weighs 298g; it has a new sole with a stiffness rating of 11 out of 12; it has a new micro-mesh top that’s perforated all around so breathability is excellent, and a new heel design that doesn’t have the retention system of other models, but fits snugly. It also has the new “millennium” fit, which is wider at the toe box.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strips of a material called Firmor act like an exoskeleton to provide more support, and Sidi claims that while the Ergo 6 is lightweight and minimalist, it is built to last, with many of its parts such as dials and heel inserts being replaceable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They’re incredibly comfortable and you’ve still got that longevity,’ says Wise. ‘The Ergo 6 is a taster of what’s to come.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano RC703</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"943\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-08-shimano-970x943.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-08-shimano-970x943.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-08-shimano-300x292.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-08-shimano-768x747.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-08-shimano-750x729.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-08-shimano-1140x1108.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-08-shimano.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>£219.99, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fshimano-clothing-rc7-rc703-shoes-varbrc703\" target=\"_blank\">freewheel.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RC703 may not be the top shoe in Shimano’s lineup, but it borrows many of the technologies from its pro-level (and significantly more expensive) big brother, the S-Phyre.

At the top of the tree is the Trek RSL Knit, which is like a highly engineered sock inside a supportive structure of straps. Far more conventional, but no less technological, is the Trek RSL, which has been designed in collaboration with the Lidl-Trek squad, home to British stars Tao Geoghegan Hart and Lizzie Deignan. The RSLs have been ridden by the team at Grand Tours and Monuments since their launch last year, and have seen frequent visits to the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trek says the RSL is its most comfortable road shoe to date, in part thanks to the MetNet relief system. This technology uses a TPU thermoplastic to offer extra stretch across the synthetic upper, providing a forgiving fit for a wider variety of foot shapes. When coupled with MetNet’s proprietary star-shaped ventilation holes, the shoe’s upper becomes more malleable and helps to eliminate hotspots and pressure points.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-13-trek.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, there are four more vents on the outsole, which itself is made using the stiffest OCLV carbon plate in Trek’s arsenal.

Take the uppers of Scott’s Road RC Ultimate: the toe end is made from TPU, a lightweight thermoplastic found in many top-end shoes, but around the forefoot – a crucial area for comfort and support – Scott has found something outside cycling and well beyond the mainstream – Carbitex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘At the time we started to use Carbitex it was the only adaptable material with the strength of carbon fibre,’ says Scott product designer Bruno Schaller, explaining that the material, made of carbon fibres set in a flexible resin, has exceptional strength-to-weight while being able to conform – but crucially not stretch – around the foot. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-19-scott.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The idea is that the most efficient shoes are the ones that hold the foot in a comfortable yet secure position, because shifting around inside a shoe means precious watts are lost before pedalling energy gets transmitted to pedals. It’s a similar story with the Ultimate’s soles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They’re made from our HMX carbon fibre sandwiching a Corecell foam core, a type of polymer-based foam that adds structural support but is incredibly light,’ says Schaller. ‘Then inside the shoe is our ErgoLogic 3D pre-shaped insole with adjustable arch and metatarsal wedges, in order that the shoe can be optimised for a stable foundation for a variety of foot shapes, improving comfort and power transfer.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in a pair of Boa Li2 dials and the whole package is one of the most advanced road shoes out there, thoroughly deserving of its Ultimate name.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Tempr CFR</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"691\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-970x691.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-970x691.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-300x214.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-768x547.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-120x86.webp 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-350x250.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-750x534.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-1140x812.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon-190x136.webp 190w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/road-shoes-2025-supplement-20-canyon.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>£319.95, <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gear/clothing/cycling-shoes/canyon-tempr-cfr/\" target=\"_blank\">canyon.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CFR part of the Tempr CFR name stands for Canyon Factory Racing and is the title given to the German brand’s premium bikes and kit.
