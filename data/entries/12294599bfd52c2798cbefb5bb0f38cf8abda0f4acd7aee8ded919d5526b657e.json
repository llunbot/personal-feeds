{"title":"‘Electric Bike, Stupid Love of My Life’","link":"https://craigmod.com/essays/electric_bikes/","date":1689380859000,"content":"\n<p>Craig Mod:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve long since posited world peace could be achieved if you\nbought everyone in the world a bike, but now I want those bikes to\nbe electric. I want everyone to feel this silliness, this\npunch-drunk stupidity of pure love, this sense of cheating the\nrules, the norms, this sense of ever-present delight. At our\nworst, humans mindlessly consume, sear the earth and each other,\nfill our bodies with poisons. At our best we invent electric\nbikes. Batteries have gotten more efficient, motors smaller and\nmore powerful. The last decade has brought great efficiency to\nthese machines, and the next ten years will only double down on\nthese gains. Electric bike numbers are up, year over year over\nyear. Tremendously so. Those who know, proselytize. We can’t help\nit. The charm is too great. The game non- zero sum. The more\npeople who know, the better the world. It’s a wild notion, this\nsense of goodness to be had if you just reach out for it. Goodness\nwith no real downside. Like solar panels or wind turbines,\nelectric bikes are machines that buoy the spirit and the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a lovely essay. Hard to read it and resist not immediately opening a browser tab to begin shopping for an e-bike.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/14/mod-ebikes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"12294599bfd52c2798cbefb5bb0f38cf8abda0f4acd7aee8ded919d5526b657e","category":"Tech"}
