When you get good people that support the brand it’s always a good time.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We’ve been burning the candle at both ends so to speak. Closing out SBT GRVL 2023 late into that Sunday evening and surfacing just long enough to load the van and head to Portland, Oregon for the MADE SHOW was a massive task. But lets get back into SBT GRVL.</p>\n<p>It seems SBT GRVL has always been growing and this year it felt like an all time high. Loads of great people showing up the week before to ride the gravel roads that surround our facility. Having this large event here in town allows us to open up our facility for shakeout rides, factory tours, Moots owners meet-ups and so much more. We had an great time meeting so many people from all over during the week. A huge thanks to all that came along for the ride.</p>\n<p><strong>GRAVEL FESTIVAL</strong></p>\n<p>The larger the event, the longer it lasts. We’ve noticed this at other events and Steamboat is even bigger. The weekend before the race weekend happened we noticed a stream of vans flooding into town adorn with gravels bikes. So in truth this event starts the weekend before. Many showing up to ride, eat and see the sights that surround Steamboat. It’s an amazing little town that is very good at hosting large numbers of people. Plenty of beds, plenty of restaurants, and of course, hundreds of miles of that sweet gravel everyone loves.</p>\n<p><strong>BY THE NUMBERS</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of going through each activity we hosted here’s a rough breakdown of what happened around SBT GRVL in the Moots department:</p>\n<p>Number of Moots bikes at the event: 200</p>\n<p>Number of Tacos eaten: 257</p>\n<p>Number of High-Fives: countless</p>\n<p>Number of mini Cokes handed out: 254</p>\n<p>Number of riders helped in crisis: 2 (one broken front derailleur the night before the race and one loaned out demo for a crumpled bike)</p>\n<p>Number of photos taken: 321</p>\n<p>Number of factory tours given: 245</p>\n<p>Number of gracious Moots owners: too many to count</p>\n<p>Number of hours of sleep: not many</p>\n<p>Number of times we want to go this again: 1 million</p>\n<p>We have a large photo gallery of Moots Riders at the finish and if you click the link below you can download yours!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/26295056@N07/albums/72177720310865979\">MOOTS + SBT GRVL FINISH PHOTOS</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8288-copy-1024x768.jpg\" alt width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8288-copy-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8288-copy-300x225.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8288-copy-768x576.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8288-copy-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8288-copy.jpg 1920w\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8107-copy-768x1024.jpg\" alt width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8107-copy-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8107-copy-225x300.jpg 225w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8107-copy-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8107-copy.jpg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>Until next time gravel friends!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/moots-at-sbt-grvl-2023-thats-a-wrap/\">MOOTS AT SBT GRVL 2023 THAT’S A WRAP</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots Cycles</a>.</p>","author":"Jon Cariveau","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"586dd1dd8809de1e824a92a00180754b586eb433976865e129aa32a35baaff98","category":"Cycling"}
