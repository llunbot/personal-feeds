Wheeltop hopes to reveal this in August.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned early next week for more information.</p>\n<h2>Halls and halls of OEM stuff</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Eurobike 2023 roundup day 3 – OEM stuff\" title=\"Eurobike 2023 roundup day 3 – OEM stuff\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Do you want to start up an electric bike battery company?

That’s in roughly the same ballpark as the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-corima-mcc-evo/\">Corima MCC EVO wheelset</a> (1,480g), which also launched at Eurobike.</p>\n<p>All that aside, they look cool – more Batmobile than bicycle.</p>\n<h2>Limited-edition Ortlieb bikepacking luggage</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Limited-edition Ortlieb bikepacking luggage\" title=\"Limited-edition Ortlieb bikepacking luggage\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You know these bikepacking bags are gravel-specific because they’re an earthy tone.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Ortlieb has released a limited-edition run of its waterproof <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a> in an oh-so-gravel-friendly range of earthy tones.</p>\n<p>We were particularly drawn to this sand-coloured saddle pack, bar bag and frame pack.</p>\n<h2>Croder Spirit Crank Fitter adjustable cranks</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Croder Spirit Crank Fitter adjustable cranks\" title=\"Croder Spirit Crank Fitter adjustable cranks\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These cranks could be perfect for riders who want to experiment with crank length.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These neat cranks from Croder can be adjusted in length from 140mm to 180mm using sliding inserts.</p>\n<p>Inserts to increase the Q-factor (the stance width of the crankset) by 4mm are also available.</p>\n<p>The cranks are available to fit 24mm, 30mm and DUB axles. The cranks can also be had with a 40t direct-mount chainring or 4-arm and 5-arm chainring spiders.</p>\n<p>Priced at NT$12,000 (approximately £315), these could be a great solution for bike fitters who want a single pair of cranks that can be fitted to most clients’ bikes.</p>\n<h2>Moulton NS Safari gravel bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Moulton NS Safari.\" title=\"Moulton Safari20230621_stan-portus41\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Moulton NS Safari is the brand’s first bike to feature front and rear disc brakes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-moulton-ns-safari/\">Moulton NS Safari</a> is the British manufacturer’s first bike to feature disc brakes on the front and rear.</p>\n<p>The bike is said to prioritise performance and versatility and to be suitable for all types of terrain, including <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>.</p>\n<p>The bike features Moulton’s Flexitor rubber suspension system in the front fork and its Hydroelastic rear suspension.</p>\n<p>As pictured, with a complete <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Campagnolo Ekar groupset</a>, the bike costs £10,950.</p>\n<h2>Ora titanium pannier rack</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ora titanium pannier rack (1 of 1)\" title=\"Ora titanium pannier rack (1 of 1)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pannier racks are rarely manufactured from titanium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The vast majority of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-pannier-bags/\">pannier</a> racks are made from aluminium, with a smaller number of niche or bespoke options made from steel (or, occasionally, stainless steel).</p>\n<p>An even smaller number are made from titanium, so this modular touring rack from ti’ specialists Ora immediately caught our eye.</p>\n<p>The rack is heavily braced and adjustable, which should make it a great option for cycle tourists who want the strength of steel with a weight close to that of alloy.</p>\n<p>No word on pricing but, given a comparatively simple Tubus Airy rack will set you back £396 at RRP, you can assume this will be a pricey number.</p>\n<h2>Earlyrider Bella Velio kids’ bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Early Rider Bella Velio\" title=\"Early Rider Bella Velio\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Look at it!

This is powered by a 630Wh battery, which can be accessed through the underside of the down tube.</p>\n<p>The motor is protected by a metal skidplate that wouldn’t look amiss on a motocross bike.</p>\n<p>Privateer has said it is still developing the production model, with orders not too far away.</p>\n<h2>Fox Speedframe RS helmet</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fox Speedframe RS\" title=\"Fox Speedframe RS\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Speedframe RS is set to launch next year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Fox displayed an early prototype of a new Speedframe RS <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">mountain bike helmet</a> that is expected to launch next year.</p>\n<p>The new helmet features an exclusive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-mips/\">MIPS</a> Intergra Split dual-density protection system.</p>\n<p>Fox says the system delivers a higher level of protection for both low and high-speed impacts while retaining a low-friction layer that reduces rotational forces in a crash.</p>\n<p>A Boa dial is used to adjust the helmet’s fit, while a Fidlock snap buckle is used to fasten it.</p>\n<p>Fox says it has worked to make its helmet more compatible with sunglasses, with the front vents now featuring rubberised zones to grab glasses legs.</p>\n<h2>KS Lev Circuit wireless dropper</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"KS Lev Circuit\" title=\"KS Lev Circuit\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> KS has added a wireless dropper post to its range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/seatpost-and-seat-pin/rockshox-reverb-axs-wireless-dropper-post-review/\">RockShox Reverb AXS</a>, the new KS Lev Circuit dropper post connects to a wireless remote using a Bluetooth connection. The dropper post’s battery is hidden underneath the saddle.</p>\n<p>KS say the battery in the post should last for approximately 9,000 actuations.</p>\n<p>The air pressure inside the dropper can be adjusted, enabling you to control how fast the dropper returns to full height.</p>\n<p>The KS Lev Circuit is IP67 certified, meaning it can survive being submerged in up to one metre of water for half an hour.</p>\n<p>KS offers the dropper in a 30.9mm or 31.6mm seatpost diameter, with travel lengths starting at 125mm and topping out at 200mm.</p>\n<h2>Scott Endorphin Concept</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Scott Endorphin Concept\" title=\"Scott Endorphin Concept\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Scott could be working on a reimagined Endorphin.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Scott presented a design concept on its stand that highlights the development of carbon fibre frame construction.</p>\n<p>The original Endorphin was released in 1995 and was Scott’s first carbon fibre bike, with the material used to add compliance to the rear triangle.</p>\n<p>This new concept looks to feature a new compliance zone within the top tube, which Scott is calling an Anti Vibration System.</p>\n<p>A honeycomb section is also present on the integrated handlebar, which features internal cable routing.</p>\n<p>Syncros Silverton SL wheels are used, which is the brand’s lightest XC wheelset.</p>\n<h2>Prototype SRAM motor</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM eMTB motor\" title=\"SRAM eMTB motor\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM is still playing hard to get with its new eMTB motor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s no secret that SRAM is working on an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motor</a>, but little has been said by the brand.</p>\n<p>A prototype of the motor was spotted on the Gas Gas stand fitted to the brand’s<br />\nE-EDR race bike.</p>\n<p>Being co-sponsor of the Gas Gas/SRAM race team, we can be pretty confident this prototype comes from SRAM.</p>\n<p>The top tube of the bike looks to feature a screen, though this was hidden with black electrical tape.</p>\n<p>A new SRAM AXS remote was fitted to the left-hand side of the handlebar, which suggests this is how you will select ride modes.</p>\n<h2>Schwalbe Tacky Chan</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Tacky Chan\" title=\"Schwalbe Tacky Chan\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tacky Chan is Schwalbe’s latest tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Schwalbe has released a new tyre designed for downhill and enduro riding.</p>\n<p>The Tacky Chan was seen at DH World Cup races last season, with black marker used to hide the branding on the sidewall.</p>\n<p>The new tyre has an open shoulder area, which Schwalbe says improves mud-shedding while providing direct feedback to the rider.</p>\n<p>Schwalbe also claims the tyre is constructed from fair trade rubber, and is 8 per cent lighter than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/mountain-bike-tyres/schwalbe-magic-mary-supertrail-addix-ultrasoft-evo-tle-29x2-4-review/\">Magic Mary</a>.</p>\n<p>The tyre is available with Super Downhill, Super Gravity and Super Trail protection, with only soft and ultra-soft compounds available.</p>\n<h2>Refreshed DT Swiss suspension</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DT Swiss F353 One\" title=\"DT Swiss F353 One\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The DT Swiss F353 One has been updated for 2023.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The top-end F353 One fork carries over technology from the previous generation, but sees the damper incorporating a coil for the initial 30mm of travel.</p>\n<p>DT Swiss says this aids small-bump sensitivity, while keeping a supportive mid-stoke.</p>\n<p>As with the old fork, the stanchion diameter remains at 35mm and the lowers have also been carried over from the previous model. Adjustments can now be made externally too.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at £1,049/$1,149/€1,149.</p>\n<h2>Alutec Armageddon ebike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Alutec Armageddon E-bike\" title=\"Alutec Armageddon E-bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Just look at that head angle!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The DT Swiss stand also played host to a new Alutec Armageddon <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-an-electric-bike/\">electric bike</a> featuring a stonking 57-degree head tube angle.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bike</a> uses a Shimano EP8 motor and was decked out in DT Swiss’ new components.</p>\n<p>The battery appears to be accessible through a panel on the underside of the down tube.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"baa48fa2ae8472882c3d62b1da3d4eb3b4df770df21c3b15767bec18bad51b33","category":"Cycling"}
