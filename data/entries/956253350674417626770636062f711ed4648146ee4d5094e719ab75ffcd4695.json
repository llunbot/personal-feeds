There will also be some AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence coming to some iPhones (find out if they’ll be on your iPhone below).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This free software update brings interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. It is like getting a new iPhone without paying a penny. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about iOS 18, including which iPhones will be able to run iOS 18, the new features – and the new features still to come because they weren’t ready in time for the launch of iOS 18. We’ll also discuss any problems and fixes, the latest update and what’s coming in the next update to iOS 18. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have information about the beta program including the latest version of the public and developer betas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update: October 15 – iOS 18.1 beta 7 is out, and the full update could arrive on October 28. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: Latest version </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18.0.1: October 3, 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 18: September 16</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 18 arrived on Monday, September 16. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362011/watchos-11-watch-faces-fitness-vitals-translate.html\">watchOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html\">iPadOS 18</a> were also launched at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version is iOS 18.0.1. It arrived on October 3, about two and a half weeks after iOS 18 launched. The first update allowed Apple to address some bugs and problems with the initial release, these included:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– Touch screen may be temporarily unresponsive in certain circumstances on iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.<br />– Camera may freeze when recording macro mode video on the Ultra Wide camera in 4K with HDR turned off on iPhone 16 Pro models.<br />– Messages may unexpectedly quit when replying to a message with a shared Apple Watch face.<br />– Performance may be impacted due to an issue with memory allocation on some iPhone models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also working on a beta of iOS 18.1, which includes Apple Intelligence features. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> is not available in the first version. The first set of features will come in iOS 18 with more following in subsequent updates. See our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">detailed roadmap of Apple Intelligence features</a> and their likely release dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2461801/apples-latest-os-updates-leave-you-wanting-for-more.html\">iOS 18 is missing more than just Apple Intelligence</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.1: Release date and new features </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18.1 release date: October 28 (predicted)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman claimed in an October 6 newsletter that iOS 18.1 will arrive on Monday, October 28. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seventh beta version of iOS 18.1 arrived on October 15. The sixth beta version of iOS 18.1 arrived on October 7 and added Sleep Apnea warnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 18.1 will bring the first bunch of Apple Intelligence features to iOS 18 – as long as the device is compatible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following features are available in the initial iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 beta test so we expect them to arrive on compatible iPhones (and compatible iPads) in October:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AI writing tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New and improved Siri</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mail features like smart replies and email summaries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Natural language in photos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Call recording and transcription</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Safari web page summaries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean Up tool in Photos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sleep Apnea warnings</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: Problems and bugs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Messages bug</strong>: A Messages bug that could cause crashes and may even result in the loss of valuable data was reported. It seemed to be connected to an Apple Watch feature that lets users share their watch face over Messages (or Mail). Obviously, those are quite a niche set of circumstances and the best way to avoid it appears to be to not reply to watch faces in a thread. We have more information here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463540/psa-link-sharing-bug-in-ios-18-messages-can-cause-iphone-crashes-data-loss.html\">Link-sharing bug in iOS 18 Messages can cause iPhone crashes, data loss</a>. Apple fixed this bug in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2477774/apple-releases-ios-and-ipados-18-0-1-to-fix-launch-bugs-and-m4-ipad-support.html\">iOS 18.0.1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unresponsive touch screen</strong>: iPhone 16 Pro owners have complained of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2465679/iphone-16-pro-owners-complain-of-display-dead-spots.html\">display ‘dead spots’</a>, with taps and swipes are being ignored. It is thought that this is related to the Camera Control button. Apple addressed this bug in iOS 18.0.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Camera freezes in macro mode</strong>: This was addressed in iOS 18.0.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any problems with iOS 18 you may be able to downgrade. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2020596/downgrade-iphone-older-version-ios.html\">How to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 18 to iOS 17</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: Should I install iOS 18 on my iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as your iPhone can run it, we recommend updating to iOS 18. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough, and, so far, the only problem (see above) will not affect many people. We address how <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362183/ios-18-vs-ios-17-differences.html\">How iOS 17 and iOS 18 compare</a> separately. Also take a look at: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2457787/ios-18-all-the-little-details-and-hidden-features-you-wont-want-to-miss.html\">All the little details and hidden features in iOS 18 you won’t want to miss.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we do recommend you wait a week or more so that any issues with the early release can be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets installed on mass-market iPhones. It’s also wise not to be one of the first downloaders because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: How to install</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing iOS 18 and any subsequent updates is a breeze. Just open the Settings app on your iPhone and go to General &gt; Software Update; iOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670944/how-to-update-ios-on-your-iphone.html\">iOS updating guide</a>. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little work preparing your iPhone before installing the update can help avoid problems. We advise you follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Back up your iPhone</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">Back up</a> before installing the new version and you will always be able to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672439/how-to-restore-an-iphone-or-ipad-from-an-icloud-or-itunes-backup.html\">recover your iPhone</a> with the older version of iOS running on it should things go wrong. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2020596/downgrade-iphone-older-version-ios.html\">How to downgrade an iPhone</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make space on your iPhone</strong>: If your iPhone doesn’t have a lot of available space internally we recommend having a bit of a tidy-up so you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668286/how-to-free-up-space-on-an-iphone.html\">reclaim some iPhone storage</a>. Simple ways to do this could include deleting apps you don’t use, deleting old Notes, Messages, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673055/how-to-delete-duplicate-photos-on-iphone.html\">duplicated photos</a>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Update your iPhone to the latest version</strong>: Don’t skip an update and go straight to iOS 18. If you haven’t installed iOS 17.6.1 yet do so now. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones get iOS 18?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following iPhones get support for iOS 18, the same lineup of supported devices as iOS 17. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, Pro, Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, Pro, Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XR</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone SE (2nd gen or later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2420917/ios-18-compatibility-which-iphones.html\">iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones support iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1811287/which-version-of-ios-can-my-iphone-run.html\">iOS compatibility checker</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the new features will not be supported on the older phones, because they lack the hardware necessary (a powerful enough Neural Engine or GPU to run AI stuff, or enough RAM). This is typical of new iOS releases. In 2022, for example, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X missed out on a bunch of cool stuff due to their older processor. It is no surprise, therefore, that the hardware requirements are steep for the AI-related features aka ‘Apple Intelligence’—iPhone 15 Pro or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like iOS 17, iOS 18 does not support iPhone 8 or the iPhone X which came out in 2017, but since those phones are able to run iOS 16, they will continue to get support through security updates for at least another year. With the release of iOS 18 though, Apple will stop supporting iOS 15, which will mean that iPhone 7, 7 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) will no longer get support. Generally, Apple has provided software updates for the past two versions of iOS. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675021/how-long-does-apple-support-iphones.html\">How long does Apple support iPhones</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iOS 18: Latest beta </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">iOS 18.1 beta 6</a> – developer beta released October 7.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July and continues beyond the launch of iOS 18 to the general public. There is also a separate iOS 18 Sequoia 15.1 beta that includes some as yet unavailable <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence features</a>. Initially, this beta was only available for developers, but since the launch of iOS 18 it is now available to public testers, as long as they have supported hardware (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone 16 series). See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2413704/apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-beta-available-coming-later.html\">Everything Apple Intelligence can (and can’t) do in iOS 18.1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program</a> separately. Developer betas can be risky though, so we recommend signing up for the Public Beta instead, which should be more stable. Beware though: whether a public beta or a developer beta, any beta software is not as stable as the final version and the iOS and your apps may not work properly. Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365614/should-you-install-the-ios-18-beta.html\">Should you install the iOS 18 beta?</a> for advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once registered, when you go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running: choose either iOS 18 Developer Beta or iOS 18 Public Beta. If you need help installing the developer or public betas read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">How to get the iOS beta article</a>. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">How to remove the iOS beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 features still to launch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following promised features aren’t yet in beta: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>ChatGPT integration</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Image Playground</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Genmoji</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Advanced Siri features like on-screen awareness, personal context, and actions within apps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The image features were said to arrive at launch, but more recent reports say it will come later this ye</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 features: The new features in iOS 18</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many new features in iOS 17 including a new app called Journal, Live Voicemail, and a new way to use Stickers, among dozens of other smaller changes. Rumors suggested that iOS 18 would be “one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company’s history.” As expected, in iOS 28 Apple will include some major new AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, although these features will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and newer iPhones.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all the new features will be available at launch. The first <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2413704/apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-beta-available-coming-later.html\">Apple Intelligence AI features</a> will be introduced in iOS 18.1. Other features, such as the new categories in Mail, will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update.

Prior to iOS 18 icons can be reordered or put into folders, but always fill the screen from left to right and top to bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In iOS 18 users will be able to arrange apps and widgets anywhere on the Home Screen, including right above the dock or framing a wallpaper. It will even be possible to change the lock screen icons or remove them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, App icons and widgets can have a dark or tinted effect to blend in.

A new locked hidden apps folder is also coming with iOS 18. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers will have a way to seamlessly connect third-party accessories with iPhones without letting an app see all the other devices on a user’s network.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Accessories and privacy\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Accessories and privacy\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Accessories and privacy\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Accessories-and-privacy.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Intelligence </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s new artificial intelligence system is coming to iPhone, Mac, and iPad with iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max though. (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365423/apple-intelligence-cpu-vs-memory-8gb-minimum.html\">Here’s why you’ll need to upgrade your iPhone to get Apple Intelligence</a>, also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365423/apple-intelligence-cpu-memory-neural-engine-private-cloud-compute.html\">Here’s why newer iPhones and Vision Pro can’t run Apple Intelligence</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardware requirements are steep—iPhone 15 Pro or later. iPads will need at least an M1 chip or later as will Macs. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence features include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Writing</strong> – Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Images</strong> – New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photos</strong> – A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">Apple Intelligence is a gradual rollout—here’s what you’ll get, and when</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Siri</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is to be integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Siri is said to be more “conversational” and natural, with features that “help users in their day-to-day lives.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new smart responses framework will help Siri take into account your own personal details in its replies: like people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later this year, Siri is said to get cross-device media control. So you can talk to Siri on one of your devices to control media playback on another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an update scheduled for early 2025, Siri is said to gain the ability to control nearly any app, with hundreds of possible commands. This feature will start off with single commands for Apple’s own apps and grow to include third-party apps and commands with multiple steps. In addition, Siri will be able to react to and take actions based on what is on your screen. This is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q\">said to go into beta for developers in January</a>, with a rollout to users in iOS 18.4 in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New accessibility features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is planning <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2334546/apple-to-bring-eye-tracking-vocal-shortcuts-music-haptics-and-more-accessibility-features-to-iphone-and-ipad.html\">several new accessibility features for iOS 18</a>, including Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, which will let users turn on or off specific accessibility features using a custom phrase, and Live Speech, which lets users type what they want to say and have it read out loud on phone calls or video meetings, will get the ability to add saved phrases to categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features coming after the iOS 18 release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some iOS 18 features won’t be a part of the initial release. Rather, they will be released later in 2024 or in 2025 as part of an iOS 18 point release (iOS 18.2 or iOS 18.4, for example).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the more significant features we expect to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365756/ios-18-features-not-available-at-launch.html\">come later in an iOS 18 update</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mail app features –</strong> Auto-categorizing of mail, mail digests, and summaries in your inbox are all features expected later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Home support for robot vacuums –</strong> The Home app won’t be able to start or stop your Roomba until later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drag and Drop between iPhone and Mac –</strong> You’ll be able to see and control your iPhone on your Mac when iOS 18 and macOS 15 are released, but drag-and-drop support between your Mac and iPhone will come in an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ChatGPT integration –</strong> The ability to call upon ChatGPT when using Apple’s AI tools will likely come later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advanced Siri features –</strong> Siri features like its ability to see and react to what is on your display, semantic indexing (where Siri knows and uses information from across Messages, Mail, Contacts, and more), and advanced control over apps is all coming in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405722/ios-18-how-to-vehicle-motion-cues-reduce-motion-sickness.html\">Vehicle Motion Cues</a> in iOS 18 will help reduce motion sickness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Third-party NFC transactions</strong> – Apple will allow <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2427556/apple-will-allow-third-party-nfc-transactions-beginning-with-ios-18-1-by-request.html\">third-party NFC transactions</a> beginning with iOS 18.1–by request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, all of the Apple Intelligence features will initially support only American English, and may be limited to only some regions. Additional languages and regions are likely to be available through 2025 and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Next version of iOS </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that the next version of iOS after Apple finishes development of iOS 18 will be iOS 19. But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to iOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past several years, the release of the new version of iOS has been fairly consistent, usually falling on the Monday following Apple’s iPhone launch event:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 18: Monday, September 16, 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 17: Monday, September 18, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 16: Monday, September 12, 2022 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 15: Monday, September 20, 2021 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 14: Wednesday, September 16, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 13: Thursday, September 19, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 12: Monday, September 17, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"956253350674417626770636062f711ed4648146ee4d5094e719ab75ffcd4695","category":"Apple"}
