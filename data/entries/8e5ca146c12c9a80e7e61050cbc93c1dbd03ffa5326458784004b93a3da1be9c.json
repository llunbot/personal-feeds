And there should be no live video from the rocket released to the public showing the fairing separation sequence, which exposes the payloads to the space environment for the first time.</p>\n<p>But the public saw video of the clamshell-like payload fairing falling away from the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/united-launch-alliances-atlas-v-rocket-has-a-long-sunset-ahead-of-it/\">Atlas V rocket as it fired downrange from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on September 10, 2023</a>. It wasn't pretty. Numerous chunks of material, possibly insulation from the inner wall of the payload shroud's two shells, fell off the fairing. The video embedded below shows the moment of payload fairing jettison.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/while-ula-studies-vulcan-booster-anomaly-its-also-investigating-fairing-issues/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/while-ula-studies-vulcan-booster-anomaly-its-also-investigating-fairing-issues/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e5ca146c12c9a80e7e61050cbc93c1dbd03ffa5326458784004b93a3da1be9c","category":"Tech"}
