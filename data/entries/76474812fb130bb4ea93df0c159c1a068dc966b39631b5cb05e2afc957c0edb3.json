This week, EFF's petition to Apple demanding they abandon their plans reached 25,000 signatures. This is in addition to other petitions by groups such as Fight for the Future and OpenMedia, totalling well over 50,000 signatures. The enormous coalition that has spoken out will continue to demand that user phones—both their messages and their photos—be protected, and that the company maintain its promise to provide real privacy to its users. </blockquote>The suite of Child Safety Features were originally set to debut in the United States with an update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-8/\">watchOS 8</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>. It's not clear when Apple plans to roll out the \"critically important\" features or how it intends to \"improve\" them in light of so much criticism, but the company still appears determined to roll them out in some form.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-child-safety-features/\">Apple child safety features</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/06/eff-urges-apple-abandon-csam-plans/\">EFF Pressures Apple to Completely Abandon Controversial Child Safety Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eff-pressures-apple-to-completely-abandon-controversial-child-safety-features.2309849/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Gnt7lZbK8CE:7Mv2ZfnEBN4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Gnt7lZbK8CE:7Mv2ZfnEBN4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Gnt7lZbK8CE\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"76474812fb130bb4ea93df0c159c1a068dc966b39631b5cb05e2afc957c0edb3","category":"Apple"}
