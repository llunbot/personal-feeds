This is a measure of the technical acumen of Astra engineers, who set out to execute on the vision of the company's co-founders, Chris Kemp and Adam London.</p>\n<p>During the same period, Astra's financials have taken a nose dive. When Astra went public in mid-2021, it had a valuation of $2.6 billion. The company's market value is around $25 million, based on Astra's closing price on the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>\n<p>A week ago, Astra's market value was even lower. The number rose after Astra revealed Thursday that Kemp and London made an offer to take the company private in a bid to save the startup they established in 2016.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983272#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983272&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6827b306befdad6746f807df468cf210e52638ffac9aff1896d67c9cf36f45b","category":"Tech"}
