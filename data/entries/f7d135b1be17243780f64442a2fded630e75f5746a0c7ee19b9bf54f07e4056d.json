For those people—and for those who just love a bizarre little computer—Eric Migicovsky has \"a little side project\" for you: <a href=\"https://beepberry.sqfmi.com/\">Beepberry</a>.</p>\n<p>Beepberry is the fusion of a backlit BlackBerry Classic keyboard (with the logo button and all) and mini-touchpad, a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and a Sharp Memory LCD 400x240 screen—the kind of e-paper e-paper-like screen you'd commonly see on programming calculators. It's meant to be used with <a href=\"https://www.beeper.com/\">Beeper</a>, the all-in-one chat service that can also relay SMS, including iMessage (typically through signing in to a Mac server remotely; more on that <a href=\"https://www.beeper.com/faq#how-does-beeper-connect-to-encrypted-chat-networks-like-imessage-signal-whatsapp\">in Beeper's FAQ</a>). It's <a href=\"https://shop.sqfmi.com/products/beepberry\">available now for preorder for $99</a> if you want a Pi Zero W included and for $79 if you already have one you're willing to fuse in. You'll also need an SD card.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/beepberry2.jpeg\"><img alt=\"All the nifty stuff accessible on this $80/$100 devkit device.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/beepberry2-640x289.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/beepberry2-1280x579.jpeg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/beepberry2.jpeg\">All the nifty stuff accessible on this $80/$100 devkit device.</a> (credit: Beepberry/Beeper/SQFMI)</p></div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1658854905220587522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1658854905220587522%7Ctwgr%5Eac12ee5194ef15cdb4d30a29bd8cc2d4c43f8cb0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23727218%2Fbeepberry-cyberdeck-mini-computer-raspberry-pi-beeper-messenger\">a Twitter thread</a>, Migicovsky, co-founder of Beeper and creator of the pioneering <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pebble-a-2013-smartwatch-updated-to-work-with-2022-pixel-7/\">Pebble smartwatch</a>, wrote that he wanted a \"weekend device\" that kept him in touch but didn't lead him into typical smartphone distractions. \"<span>I imagined a tiny, hackable e-paper screen with a physical keyboard, powered by a Raspberry Pi, useful to chat around my home…and pretty much nothing else,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1658854907535826945k\">Migicovsky tweeted</a>. </span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940063#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940063&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f7d135b1be17243780f64442a2fded630e75f5746a0c7ee19b9bf54f07e4056d","category":"Tech"}
