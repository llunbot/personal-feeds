{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup — Amazon ECS, RDS for MySQL, EMR Studio, AWS Community, and more — January 22, 2024","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-amazon-ecs-rds-for-mysql-emr-studio-aws-community-and-more-january-22-2024/","date":1705947029000,"content":"<p>As usual, a lot has happened in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> universe this past week. I’m also excited about all the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community\">AWS Community</a> events and initiatives that are happening around the world. Let’s take a look together!</p> \n<p><strong><span>Last week’s launches</span> </strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/\">Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)</a> now supports managed instance draining –</strong> Managed instance draining allows you to gracefully shutdown workloads deployed on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> instances by safely stopping and rescheduling them to other, non-terminating instances. This new capability streamlines infrastructure maintenance, such as deploying a new AMI version, eliminating the need for custom solutions to shutdown instances without disrupting their workloads. To learn more, check out Nathan’s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-ecs-enables-easier-ec2-capacity-management-with-managed-instance-draining/\">post on the AWS Containers Blog</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)</a> for MySQL now supports multi-source replication</strong> – Using multi-source replication, you can configure multiple RDS for MySQL database instances as sources for a single target database instance. This feature facilitates tasks such as merging shards into a single target, consolidating data for analytics, or creating long-term backups within a single RDS for MySQL instance. The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.FeatureSupport.html\">Amazon RDS for MySQL User Guide</a> has all the details.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/studio/\">Amazon EMR Studio</a> now comes with simplified create experience and improved start times</strong> – With the simplified console experience for creating EMR Studio, you can launch interactive and batch workloads with default settings more easily. The improved start times let you launch EMR Studio Workspaces for performing interactive analysis in notebooks in seconds. Have a look at the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/interactive-workloads.html\">Amazon EMR User Guide</a> to learn more.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><strong><u>Other AWS news<br /> </u></strong>Here are some additional projects, programs, and news items that you might find interesting:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/01/22/get-the-news-architecture-150.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/01/22/get-the-news-architecture-150.png\" alt=\"Get The News\" width=\"150\" height=\"91\" /></a>Summarize news using Amazon Bedrock</strong> – My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danilop\">Danilo</a> built this <a href=\"https://github.com/build-on-aws/get-the-news-rss-atom-feed-summary\">application</a> to summarize the most recent news from an RSS or Atom feed using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>.
