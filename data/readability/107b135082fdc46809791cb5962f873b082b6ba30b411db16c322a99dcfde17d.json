There’s a lot of elements that come into play here.</p><p>Surely, a good bit of that feeling of speed can be chalked up to the improved aerodynamics of the new wheels. And bumping up from even 28mm tires to these real 31mm tires means we can run slightly lower tire pressure for added comfort, grip, AND lower rolling resistance.</p><p>We’ve not tried to empirically evaluate how much more aero or more crosswind stable the new wheels are. But they do feel as fast as the old ERCs, and we haven’t felt like we were being blown around unreasonably, even on a couple of really windy recent road rides.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125235/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_180-SINC-ceramic-bearing-Ratchet-EXP-hubs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125235/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_180-SINC-ceramic-bearing-Ratchet-EXP-hubs.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss new ERC lightweight carbon aero endurance all-road wheelset review,&nbsp;180 hub, Ratchet EXP, SINC ceramic bearings\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125235/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_180-SINC-ceramic-bearing-Ratchet-EXP-hubs.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125235/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_180-SINC-ceramic-bearing-Ratchet-EXP-hubs-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125235/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_180-SINC-ceramic-bearing-Ratchet-EXP-hubs-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125235/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_180-SINC-ceramic-bearing-Ratchet-EXP-hubs-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125235/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_180-SINC-ceramic-bearing-Ratchet-EXP-hubs-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>The DT Swiss 180 hubs themselves, with SINC ceramic bearings, can’t be discounted for that effortless sensation, either. Sitting in the workstand, when you spin these wheels, they just keep going for longer than almost any other wheels we ride. And out on the road that smooth spinning carries over, paired with a fairly loud whine of the Ratchet EXP internals.</p><p>Premium ceramic bearings are almost always an expensive upgrade. But on an all-season, all-surface, all-road wheelset like this that will see some long and brutal riding conditions, the added durability seems like a real benefit that will pay off with added long-term durability (like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/01/10/first-impressions-dt-swiss-erc-1100-aero-wheels-on-mud-gravel-asphalt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we’ve seen before</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss ERC carbon Aero road bike wheels, reshaped aerodynamic all-rounder all-road wheelset,&nbsp;riding\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025255/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_pave-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p>Incremental aero advantage and tiny weight savings aside, the biggest improvements we’ve seen in the new DT Swiss ERC wheels come from the added comfort and grip of wider tires, larger overall tire volume, and the ability to run lower road tubeless tire pressures thanks to the 15% larger internal rim width.</p><p>Our Prague-based EU team rides road bikes hard. Almost every one of our road rides invariably takes in a number of different cobblestones, plus plenty of rough asphalt. And there typically tend to be fine gravel or even smooth dirt sections linking one scenic road to the next. The shift from fast-rolling 28mm to 31mm road tires makes those rides so much more enjoyable, and opens up many more routes without the need to ever really ride in heavy traffic.</p><p>The fact that these wheels allow those bigger tires with any real aero penalty is a huge benefit.</p><p>Of note, DT actually recommends a 28mm front tire paired to a 30mm rear tire as the best balance of aero speed &amp; all-road comfort with the new ERC wheels. We’ll probably keep the bigger front tire on for extra winter road riding grip, for the time being, though.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss new ERC lightweight carbon aero endurance all-road wheelset review,&nbsp;leaf-covered dirt\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12125225/DT-Swiss-new-ERC-carbon-aero-endurance-all-road-wheelset-review_leafy-dirt-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p>So with just a month riding the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/11/09/dt-swiss-new-erc-reshapes-aero-all-purpose-carbon-endurance-road-wheels-more-versatile-than-ever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DT Swiss ERC 1100 Dicut 45</a> wheels, we’re already pretty confident that they are a real upgrade over the originals, already <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/01/10/first-impressions-dt-swiss-erc-1100-aero-wheels-on-mud-gravel-asphalt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of our favorites</a> on versatile all-road performance.

The new wheels certainly feel like more versatile all-rounders than ever.
