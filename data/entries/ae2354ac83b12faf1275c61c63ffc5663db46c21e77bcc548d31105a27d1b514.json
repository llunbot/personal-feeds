If you’re attending this year’s event, you can find Limar at booth B97. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, you’ll just have to read about them here. With each helmet aimed at different kinds of riding (enduro, trails and racing), there’s likely something here you can use. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tonale-mattamaranth-side-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Tonale MIPS.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Limar Helmets: Tonale MIPS </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/limar-tonale-mountain-bike-helmet-mylimar-custom-in-usa/\">Tonale</a> MIPS is ideal for the enduro rider, Lidar said, with an “Air-Node MIPS design” and extended coverage. Weighing 310 grams for the medium size (claimed), the Tonale’s adjustment system fully wraps around the occipital area and offers five levels of height movement.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s got large vents throughout, including two on the front, five on the rear, and eight on the top. With a compact design and a large visor, it’s meant to keep riders cool and safe during “long days out on the trail,” Lidar said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> The Tonale is also available in large (which weighs a claimed 360 grams) and comes in five colorways: Matte Black, Matte Dove Gray, Matte Deep Green, Matte Amaranth, and Matte Dark Blue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will set you back $180 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pora.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>A rear view of the Pora MIPS.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lidar Helmets: Pora MIPS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the “trail rider’s dream helmet,” Lidar said of the Pora MIPS. (So if you dream about helmets, this is evidently made just for you.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Pora’s 22 air vents, you can probably expect a cool noggin with this one. The helmet’s large visor aims for protection from “branches, debris, and when the sun is low on the horizon,” Lidar said. It also comes with a height adjustment system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weighing in at a claimed 260 grams (medium size) or 285 grams (large size), the Pora comes in four colorways: Matte Black Titanium, Matte Sand Green, Matte Dark Red, and Matte Blue Purple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSRP clocks in at $135.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airatlas-mattamaranth-side.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Air Atlas MIPS in Matte Amaranth.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lidar Helmets: Air Atlas MIPS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Racers need to save every watt possible, and the Air Atlas MIPS saves 1.4 watts compared to Lidar’s Air Speed model, the company said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also quite comfy, Lidar said, including not only the Air Fit Evo adjustment system of the above helmets, but also a magnetic chin buckle and integrated pad system. Weighing a claimed 220 grams in the small size, the Air Atlas wants to keep up with the fastest riders. (That’s 235 grams and 260 grams for the medium and large sizes, respectively.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 17 vents and 6 inner-air flow channels, riders can also count on keeping their cranium well-ventilated. Colorways include Iridescent Matte Black, Iridescent White, Matte Gray, Matte Amaranth, Matte Black Titanium, Matte Blue, Above the Clouds, and Pink Blue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Air Atlas costs $320 MSRP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://limar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">limar.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/limar-helmets-usa-new-helmet-line/\">Limar USA Releases New Helmet Line Ahead of Sea Otter Classic</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Andrew McLemore","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ae2354ac83b12faf1275c61c63ffc5663db46c21e77bcc548d31105a27d1b514","category":"Cycling"}
