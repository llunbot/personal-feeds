Once there, the satellite linked up with an Internet gateway in Utah and communicated with multiple user terminals in Alaska.</p>\n<p>Sometime after this, however, the satellite experienced what Astranis characterized as an abrupt anomaly with a supplier's component on the solar array drive assembly. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gedmark/status/1682402713945128960\">In an update on Friday</a>, Astranis co-founder John Gedmark explained that this assembly rotates to solar arrays to ensure they are always pointed at the Sun, allowing the spacecraft to remain fully powered at all times.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955874#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955874&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c80bb9ff42b39aa31b723a87fc26940c56310593556bb34661059ac199678e1","category":"Tech"}
