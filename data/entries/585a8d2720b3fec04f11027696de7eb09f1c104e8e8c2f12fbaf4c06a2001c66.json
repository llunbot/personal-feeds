Now, they're sounding an alarm over impending EV mandates, particularly in the so-called Zero Emissions Vehicle states.</p>\n<p>The ZEV states—California, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia—all follow the emissions standards laid out by the California Air Resources Board, which require that by 2035, 100 percent of all new cars and light trucks be zero-emissions vehicles (which includes plug-in hybrid EVs as well as battery EVs).</p>\n<p>That goes into effect starting with model-year 2026 (i.e. midway through next calendar year) and would require a third of all new vehicles to be a BEV, claim the car dealers. But there is not enough customer demand for electrified vehicles to buy those cars, the dealers say. Worse yet, it would make gasoline-powered cars more expensive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053652#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053652&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
