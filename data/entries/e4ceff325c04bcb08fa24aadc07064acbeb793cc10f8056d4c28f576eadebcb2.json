{"title":"Gurman: Apple Intelligence Powered Siri Won’t Arrive Until iOS 18.4","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q","date":1720471511000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman, in his Power On column for Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the first time, the digital assistant will have precise\ncontrol over actions inside of Apple’s apps. That means you can\nask Siri to, say, edit a photo and then ship it off to a friend.\nIt also will have the ability to understand what you’re looking at\non your display, helping Siri determine what you want to do based\non the context. But neither of those upgrades will be ready when\nApple Intelligence launches this fall, as I’ve previously\nreported.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I’m told, Siri features are likely to go into beta\ntesting for developers in January and then debut publicly around\nthe springtime — part of an iOS 18.4 upgrade that’s already in\nthe works. Other Siri features, such as a new design and ChatGPT\nintegration, will be coming later this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\">Recents dates for iOS x.4 updates</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 17.4: 7 March 2024</li>\n<li>iOS 16.4: 27 March 2023</li>\n<li>iOS 15.4: 14 March 2022</li>\n<li>iOS 14.4: 26 January 2021</li>\n<li>iOS 13.4: 24 March 2020</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the usual pattern holds, it’s a safe guess that iOS 18.4 will arrive in mid-to-late March. (iOS 14.4 came in January, but 2020 was, needless to say, an unusual year.) This jibes with <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/06/wwdc24_apple_intelligence\">my take post-WWDC, when I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If generative AI weren’t seen as essential — both in terms of\nconsumer marketing <em>and</em> investor confidence — I think much, if\nnot most, of what Apple unveiled in “Apple Intelligence” wouldn’t\neven have been announced until <em>next year’s</em> WWDC, not last week’s\nWWDC. Again, none of the features in “Apple Intelligence” are even\navailable in beta yet, and I think all or most of them will be\navailable only under a “beta” label until next year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/08/gurman-new-siri-next-year\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e4ceff325c04bcb08fa24aadc07064acbeb793cc10f8056d4c28f576eadebcb2","category":"Tech"}
