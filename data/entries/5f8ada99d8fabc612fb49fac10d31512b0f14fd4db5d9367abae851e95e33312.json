Developers have to pay $99 per month to use the Spectacles, with a 12 month commitment, so it's about $1,200 to test them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Spectacles are heavy and bulky right now, and clearly too expensive for Snap to bring them to consumers. They are standalone AR glasses, though, similar to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/meta-augmented-reality-glasses/\">what Meta is working on</a>. The Spectacles use Snap OS and the Snap Spatial Engine, allowing for augmented reality experiences or Lenses that overlay the real world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the Spectacles were announced, Snap said they were the result of a decade of research and development. The glasses have four cameras, two Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, and tiny micro-projectors, with a 45 minute runtime before charging is needed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple was working on augmented reality smart glasses too, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-cancels-mac-connected-ar-glasses/\">canceled a version</a> that was in development in January. Apple is presumably still working on an AR glasses project of some kind, but companies like Meta and Snap that already have hardware available in some capacity will likely beat Apple to a consumer product.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/snap/\">Snap</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/snap-spectacles-gps-hand-tracking/\">Snap's Camera-Equipped AR Spectacles Get GPS and Improved Hand Tracking Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/snaps-camera-equipped-ar-spectacles-get-gps-and-improved-hand-tracking-support.2453357/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f8ada99d8fabc612fb49fac10d31512b0f14fd4db5d9367abae851e95e33312","category":"Apple"}
