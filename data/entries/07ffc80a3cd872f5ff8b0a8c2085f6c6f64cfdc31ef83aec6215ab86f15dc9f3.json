All the while trying to ignore the fact that rain was leaking down the back of your boil in the bag winter jacket… Or, just as bad, tirelessly grinding out imaginary miles while sitting on a turbo trainer, staring at your garage wall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that was then, but the world of indoor training has evolved, incorporating smart trainers, virtual cycling environments to explore, better data collection, new ways to train or race, exciting tech, a genuine sense of community and – best of all – a multitude of benefits over all-weather riding heroics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend the darker months on an indoor trainer and you’ll emerge next spring a fitter, happier, altogether better cyclist. Here’s how…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Safe and consistent </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter roads are unpredictable; an indoor trainer setup isn’t. ‘Winter brings unpredictable weather, hazards, traffic and interruptions,’ says Simon Beldon, cycling coach for <a href=\"http://www.mattbottrillperformancecoaching.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Bottrill Performance Coaching</a>. ‘But training indoors eliminates these variables. Well executed training can be completed every time, ensuring you get the maximum benefit from each session, and can maintain the exact tempo, resistance, and cadence you need for your workout, ensuring training objectives are met.’ </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift indoor training\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> readers echo Simon’s assessment. Rob Fairburn, 51, was once an all-weather rider, until he took his winter rides indoors. ‘It just makes it so much easier to follow a training plan to the letter,’ he says. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power with precision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most pivotal measurements of performance is your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), and modern indoor trainers can help you get the most from that data to boost your strength, ensuring you’re stronger than ever when you hit the roads again next year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Most smart trainers measure power output, giving an objective view of your performance,’ says Beldon. ‘By monitoring metrics such as FTP, Critical Power, or your maximum sprint, you can set those training zones and track your progress.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No time-wasters</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift indoor training\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Indoor training can be done at any time, regardless of weather, or time of day, making it useful for people on tight schedules or with family and work commitments. ‘An hour on an indoor trainer can be a full hour of productive training, whereas the same hour outdoors might include stops, interruptions, and other inefficiencies,’ Beldon suggests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> reader Fairburn’s real-world findings almost blow the ‘cycling widow’ scenario out of the water: ‘It means my training can fit in better with family commitments, which might not make me a better cyclist, but certainly helps with marital harmony!’ So, a happier rider (and a happier significant other) is a better rider. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift indoor training\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Speaking of saved time, also consider the lack of cleaning involved – you don’t have to hose down a smart trainer to get the salt and grit off it or worry about wear and tear on things like tyres and brake pads. Though your bars, shifters and headset may thank you for putting a towel down and giving them a 10-second wipe down every now and then.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Maximum motivation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Platforms such as Zwift have transformed indoor cycling into an experience cyclists come to relish. ‘You can explore virtual worlds, join group rides, participate in races, and even follow structured workouts,’ explains Beldon. ‘The sense of community this provides can really add to motivation.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fairburn agrees, adding, ‘Taking part in organised group rides with club members keeps my motivation up, and actually makes me want to get on the trainer – it’s not something I have to force myself to do. And doing races on Zwift gives me targets to aim for as the winter drags on – I feel like all the training is being put to good use.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Better for your body</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift indoor training\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ever considered how indoor training hones your skills and endurance? Beldon has some key insights into its hidden benefits: ‘Indoor trainers can help you focus on pedalling technique, with many trainers and software platforms offering drills or feedback to help cyclists develop a more efficient pedal stroke and maintain a consistent cadence, leading to better energy utilisation on the road.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing every indoor cyclist quickly learns is that you’ll need a fan. However, says Beldon, ‘because indoor training is warmer than outdoors, this heat can be used to mimic some of the conditions of summer or hot-weather riding, helping riders improve their heat tolerance and adaptability’. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get set, get exploring</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Zwift indoor training\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/zwift-indoor-training-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s easier than ever to get the ideal indoor setup, with the recent launch of the new <a href=\"https://uk.zwift.com/pages/zwift-hub-one\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift Hub One smart trainer</a> (£549, including a year of Zwift membership).
