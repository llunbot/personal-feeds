Usually, when a company gets spun out of Google it becomes an Alphabet company, but that's not the case here. Google is transferring assets to a new independent company, of which Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners (SIP) is an investor, and Alphabet is an investor in SIP.</p>\n<p>The first existing service getting pulled into Renew Home is <a href=\"https://nestrenew.google.com/welcome/\">Nest Renew</a>. This service for Nest Thermostats uses power company data to tell consumers how their electricity is being generated and what it costs. That data lets your thermostat do things like automatically shift heating and cooling to times of day when energy is cheaper or cleaner, and shows various reports about the cleanness of the energy you've been using. (Nest's feature that lets utility companies remotely <em>take control</em> of your thermostat, Rush Hour Rewards, does not seem to be part of Renew Home.)</p>\n<p>Another service being pulled into Renew Home is the SIP-owned OhmConnect, which is the same basic idea as Nest's grid data-power thermostat adjustments but for more than just your thermostat. OhmConnect is compatible with a <a href=\"https://www.ohmconnect.com/how-it-works/smart-home\"><em>very</em> small list</a> of smart devices, like Nest-rival Ecobee and Honeywell thermostats, TP-Link's \"Kasa\" smart home system, and Tesla vehicles. The backbone of the service appears to be the in-house \"<a href=\"https://www.ohmconnect.com/ohmplug\">OhmPlug</a>\" smart outlet, which can monitor the energy usage of anything that plugs into the wall. By seeing that you've turned these smart devices during peak usage times, OhmConnect offers people rewards like gift cards or cash for not using power when the grid is at capacity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991139#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991139&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c43a8ed86f20f74e13c664ba01e0f5999d33940300ee25e6033df016cf896e69","category":"Tech"}
