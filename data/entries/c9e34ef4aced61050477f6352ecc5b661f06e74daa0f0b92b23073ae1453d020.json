The driver later admitted to <em><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-tesla-driver-arrested-autopilot-1851224830\">Gizmodo</a></em> that it was a \"skit\" made with the help of friends, and yet incredibly he reportedly \"drove with the headset for 30-40 seconds.\" Vision Pro has passthrough video, but overlays interactive virtual content onto physical space, which is clearly going to be distracting for a driver. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Reminder—ALL advanced driver assistance systems available today require the human driver to be in control and fully engaged in the driving task at all times. <a href=\"https://t.co/OpPy36mOgC\">pic.twitter.com/OpPy36mOgC</a></p>— Secretary Pete Buttigieg (@SecretaryPete) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretaryPete/status/1754559027688685941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nApple in its Vision Pro <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213944\">support documentation</a> cautions users to \"never use the device while operating a moving vehicle, bicycle, heavy machinery, or in any other situations requiring attention to safety.\" Apple says to use Vision Pro outside \"only in controlled environments.\"\r<br />\n<blockquote>Avoid situations that could cause you to trip and fall, like uneven terrain, or obstacles that you could collide with. If you are outside, avoid extreme temperatures, rain, fog, or moisture of any kind. Apple Vision Pro shouldn’t be used near roadways or areas where moving objects present a collision risk.</blockquote>Apple Vision Pro launched in the U.S. on Friday, and there are already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/vision-pro-videos-for-work-gaming-flying-more/\">several YouTube videos</a> of people wearing the headset while skateboarding along busy streets, walking around airport terminals, using the subway, and navigating other public places.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/idiot-driver-seen-wearing-apple-vision-pro/\">Video of Tesla Driver Wearing Vision Pro Sparks Government Warning</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-of-tesla-driver-wearing-vision-pro-sparks-government-warning.2418632/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c9e34ef4aced61050477f6352ecc5b661f06e74daa0f0b92b23073ae1453d020","category":"Apple"}
