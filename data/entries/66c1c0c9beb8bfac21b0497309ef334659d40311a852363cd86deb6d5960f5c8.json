The achievement suggests that future weather forecasting may become far more accurate, reports <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/11/14/weather-forecasting-artificial-intelligence-google/\">The Washington Post</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca5d655f-d684-4dec-8daa-1c58b0674be1\">Financial Times</a>.</p>\n<p>In the study, GraphCast demonstrated superior performance over the world's leading conventional system, operated by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In a comprehensive evaluation, GraphCast outperformed ECMWF's system in 90 percent of 1,380 metrics, including temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, and humidity at various atmospheric levels.</p>\n\n<p>And GraphCast does all this quickly: \"It predicts hundreds of weather variables, over 10 days at 0.25Â° resolution globally, in under one minute,\" write the authors in the paper \"Learning skillful medium-range global weather forecasting.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983760#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983760&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66c1c0c9beb8bfac21b0497309ef334659d40311a852363cd86deb6d5960f5c8","category":"Tech"}
