ChromeOS devices with the moniker have minimum hardware requirements and will be granted exclusive software and AI features, with Google promising a higher level of performance. On October 8, eight new laptops with the Chromebook Plus branding will be released in North America, starting at $399.</p>\n<p>In a blog post today, John Maletis, VP of ChromeOS product, engineering, and UX at Google, said Chromebook Plus laptops have \"double the performance\" when compared to the top-selling Chromebooks from July to December 2022. Most of that somewhat vague claim comes from the Chromebook Plus' minimum hardware requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intel Core i3 12th Gen or AMD Ryzen 3 7000-series processor</li>\n<li>8GB of RAM</li>\n<li>128GB of storage</li>\n<li>1080p IPS display</li>\n<li>1080p resolution webcam with temporal noise reduction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some Chromebooks released before today meet those minimum requirements already. A Google spokesperson said that owners of such laptops \"will get upgraded to the Chromebook Plus software experience in the coming weeks.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971482#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5c206a89b749ab9ab5f146cd7b773e2847027437c62da6299f103172c86b0745","category":"Tech"}
