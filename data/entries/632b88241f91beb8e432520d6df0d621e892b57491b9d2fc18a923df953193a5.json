So when users across the Internet started making note of the mysterious and intriguingly named <a href=\"https://blackmesa.com/\">BlackMesa.com</a> recently, our ears perked up for signs of a new promotional <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/technopaedia/2008/05/alternate-reality-game/\">alternate reality game</a> (ARG).</p>\n<p>Alas, this seems like yet another false alarm. BlackMesa.com is simply the website for Black Mesa, which <a href=\"https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades\">confirmed in a public statement</a> that it is \"actually a real company in the Boston area... working hard to assure and secure vaccine and other biological manufacturing production.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HALF LIFE 3 MIGHT BE GETTING ANNOUNCED ON SEPTEMBER 30TH<a href=\"https://t.co/hSytiq2GoR\">https://t.co/hSytiq2GoR</a> Just went live and it has a countdown at the bottom of the page, that ends on September 30th.

But in 2022, a page <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220331041630/http://www.blackmesa.com/\">advertising the domain's availability for purchase</a> was suddenly replaced by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220911192743/https://www.blackmesa.com/\">a mysterious logo</a> that bears a striking resemblance to <a>the fictional Black Mesa logo</a> in the games.
