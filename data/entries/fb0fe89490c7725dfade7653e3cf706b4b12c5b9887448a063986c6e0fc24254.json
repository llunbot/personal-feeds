Apple could manufacture smart home cameras and other devices that would connect to its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> smart home platform and that would tie in with a planned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/\">smart home \"command center\"</a> that could come out as soon as next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/homekit-showdown-redux.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAs one example, Gurman suggests Apple could create an indoor security camera that could also be used as a baby monitor, which is in line with a report we heard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/kuo-apple-smart-home-camera-and-more-2026/\">from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> yesterday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo claimed that Apple is designing a smart home camera that will be manufactured starting in 2026, with Apple planning to sell \"tens of millions\" of the devices over the long term. Kuo says that the cameras that Apple is working on will have wireless connectivity and deep integration with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman does not seem as sure that Apple will follow through on plans to create its own smart home products. He says that it's something Apple is \"exploring\" that could be prioritized should its upcoming smart home hub device turn out to be a success.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple would likely emphasize privacy with its smart home cameras, providing an alternative to cameras from companies like Amazon's Ring and Google's Nest. Ring has been derided for its privacy policies over the years, primarily because it had a \"Request for Assistance\" tool that allowed law enforcement officials to request video footage from Ring customers. Ring has provided police officers with Ring camera footage without notifying users, and reserves the right to do so in emergency situations. Google's Nest brand also says that it will provide police with smart home camera footage in emergency situations without a warrant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is known for having strong privacy protections, and it is possible that customers would trust a smart home camera from Apple more than a smart home camera from a company like Ring. Apple already designed a ‌HomeKit‌ protocol for cameras called <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, which is end-to-end encrypted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior to coming out with any smart home accessories, Apple plans to release an iPad-like smart home display that will serve as a home hub. The smart home device, which is set to come out as soon as March 2025, will run apps and will control ‌HomeKit‌ and Matter-based accessories.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/\">Apple Smart Home Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home/\">Home</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-smart-home-products/\">Apple Might Make Smart Home Products Like Cameras</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-might-make-smart-home-products-like-cameras.2442804/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fb0fe89490c7725dfade7653e3cf706b4b12c5b9887448a063986c6e0fc24254","category":"Apple"}
