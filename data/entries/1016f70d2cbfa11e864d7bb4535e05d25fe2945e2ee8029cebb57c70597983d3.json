Among the new features coming to Macs are iPhone mirroring, which puts your iPhone screen on your Mac’s display and lets you interact with it via your mouse and keyboard, a new Video conferencing presenter preview, and changes to Safari. In addition, developers will be easily able to port games between iPhone, Mac, and iPad. Read on for the lowdown on all the new features and improvements coming later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This free software update will bring a raft of interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about macOS 15. Some new features are reserved for Macs with an M-series chip. Apple also showcased a number of Apple Intelligence features that will offer help with writing, creating images, editing photos, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developer beta was released on June 10 and we will discuss the latest versions of the beta and how to get your hands on that below and in separate articles. We will also explain when the final version of macOS 15 will come out, how to get it when it does, which Mac models will be able to run macOS 15, and the features that will be added in the new OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update August 28, 2024:</strong> Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 beta 8 and the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 3 to developers.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 name: What will the new version be called?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since Apple stopped using the names of jungle cats with macOS 10.9 Mavericks, it’s used California places to identify its annual OS updates. The last several years have been Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina. Apple has trademarked several other place names, including Condor, Mammoth, Redwood, and Sequoia – so the name Sequoia was expected to appear at some point and indeed it has. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS 15 Sequoia is named after the national park in California, home to mountains, canyons and the world’s largest trees. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final version of macOS 15 will be released to the general public in the fall. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships, although in 2023 the macOS release came sooner than was usual. Here are the release dates for the previous five versions of macOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 10.14 Mojave: September 24, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As in 2023, we may see macOS 15 arrive in September, around the time of iOS 18, possibly September 23. But we may be waiting until late October, perhaps October 21, 2024 for the launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will hold an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a>/<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch 10</a> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">launch event in September</a> (see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">how to watch the Apple September event live stream</a>), during which it may announce the release date of the new macOS. Of course, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new Apple products</a> launch throughout the year – see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">when is the next Apple event</a> to learn more about the company’s product launch plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/macos-sequoia-mid-september-launch-date/\">MacRumors</a>, Apple is planning to release macOS Sequois in September, at the same time as iOS 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final release comes out, installing macOS Sequoia will be a breeze. Open System Settings and go to General &gt; Software Update; macOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">macOS updating guide</a>. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia beta: latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Developer beta</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple began the beta program soon after it revealed the details of macOS 15 at WWDC. The developer beta is available for anyone who wants to run it, but it should be noted that this early beta is very likely to be buggy, so we don’t recommend installing it on a primary device. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">How to install the Mac beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second version of the developer beta arrived on June 24. This version brought iPhone Mirroring–the ability to access an iPhone through a Mac. (See the new features section below for more details).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third developer beta arrived on July 10. The macOS Sequoia 15 developer beta 4 was released on July 23. Developer beta 5 was released on August 5. Developer beta 6 was released on August 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 29, Apple jumped to macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta and introduced some Apple Intelligence features. This is because the initial launch of macOS 15 Sequoia will not include AI features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 12, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 2. It is a developer beta and will only run on M-series Macs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers working on the iOS 15 beta Apple released iOS 15 beta 6 on August 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that a report by <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/30/apple-intelligence-macos-external-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a> states that Apple Intelligence will not run if the 15.1 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672585/how-to-install-macos-on-an-external-drive.html\">beta is running on an external drive</a>. It’s not known if this condition will remain when Apple officially releases 15.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 20, Apple released the macOS 15 beta 7 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 28. Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 beta 8 and the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 3 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Public beta</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Running alongside the developer beta is a public beta.  Public beta testers can’t try out the Sequois 15.1 beta (unless they sign up for a developer account), but Apple is running a macOS Sequoia 15 public beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released the macOS Sequoia public beta on July 15, 2024. In 2023 Apple Apple released the first public beta of macOS 14 on July 12. The second update to the pubic beta came on July 23, 2024 and the third on August 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released the Sequoia public beta 6 on August 28, 2024. The Sequoia public beta 5 was released on August 20, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beta testing will continue even after Apple releases macOS Sequoia to the general public as Apple develops new features not available at launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install the macOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. Since June 2023 Apple has opened the beta to all registered developers–so now everyone can get the earliest possible access to the macOS beta without paying a penny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are interested in running the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta to try the Apple Intelligence features, you must install it on your Mac’s internal drive. A report from <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/30/apple-intelligence-macos-external-drive/\">9to5Mac</a> says that Apple Intelligence on the 15.1 beta does not work on external drive installations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer you can wait for the Public Beta, which is likely to be more stable than the developer beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program</a> separately, including details of how to get a free developer account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once registered, when you go to System Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. For example, if you want to install the developer beta select macOS 15 Public Beta, alternatively, if it’s the public beta you want, select macOS 15 Public Beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: betas are not as stable as the official version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install the beta, follow our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">macOS beta installation guide</a>. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove macOS beta</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program for more advice</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia compatibility: Which Macs will be able to run macOS 15?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following Macs get support for macOS 15. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iMac from 2019 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro from 2019 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iMac Pro from 2017</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Studio from 2022 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Air from 2020 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini from 2018 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Pro from 2018 and later</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This meant that there are two 13-inch MacBook Air models from 2018 and 2019 running Sonoma that won’t be able to install Sequoia. There are a few <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2366862/macos-sequoia-intel-mac-compatibility-feature-iphone-mirroring.html\">Intel Macs that can run macOS Sequoia</a> though. We discuss how <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2379434/macos-sequoia-vs-sonoma-difference.html\">macOS Sequoia compares to Sonoma</a> separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, only Macs with an M1, M2, or M3-series chip will support the new AI features referred to as “Apple Intelligence”. That includes the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iMac from 2021 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro from 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Studio from 2022 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Air from late 2020 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini from late 2020 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Pro from late 2020 and later </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will still provide security updates for Macs that are not able to run macOS 15. Generally, Apple provides software updates for the past two versions of macOS. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html\">How long does Apple support Macs</a>. On average, Macs get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1997296/intel-mac-support-compatibility-apple-silicon.html\">6.6 years of macOS updates</a>, with models older than that only receiving another year or two of security updates and bug fixes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The compatibility list is becoming a pressing concern for users of Intel Macs. After Apple introduced its M-series Macs, the company said it would continue to support Intel Macs for several years, but it did not offer specifics. The last Mac to switch from Intel to Apple Silicon was the Mac Pro last year. The clock is ticking on Intel Macs, but the last generation of Intel Macs remains on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS 15 compatibility list</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most likely candidates to drop support are the 2018 models and the iMac Pro. To find out which version of macOS and older Mac can run take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS compatibility list</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many new features arrived in macOS 14 Sonoma in 2023 including changes to Widgets, a new Game Mode, the ability to easily turn web pages into web apps, and fun additions to video conferencing apps. Rumors suggested that there wouldn’t be many new features in macOS 15, with AI-related improvements in iOS 18 taking most of the development focus. However, there are some some AI improvements coming alongside iPhone mirroring on your Mac display, a new Presenter Preview for video conferencing apps, and Game Porting Toolkit 2 for porting games between Mac, iPhone and iPad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has announced numerous new features for the update which we will describe below. Not all the new features will be available at launch though. Some new features will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone mirroring</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>iPhone mirroring is a new development of Continuity. Continuity is a feature that has existed on Macs for a number of years that means you can use your Mac together with other devices in a seamless way, making cut and paste, screen sharing and mouse and keyboard sharing possible across devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new ability to mirror an iPhone on a Mac’s display, it will be possible for a Mac to connect to an iPhone and display the iPhone screen on the Mac’s display. This way a user will be able to control their iPhone from their Mac, using the keyboard and mouse to interact. Drag and drop between the Mac and iPhone will also be possible. Users can also mirror the iPhone in a window on the Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also be possible to launch their iPhone apps via their Mac. Any audio from the iPhone will play through the Mac’s speakers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During any manipulation of the iPhone via the Mac, the iPhone will remain locked so nobody can see what is being done. It will also be possible to use the phone normally while it is connected to the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will also be able to receive iPhone notifications on a Mac. They will appear alongside Mac notifications. These can be interacted with even when the iPhone isn’t nearby.

Apple did reveal that it will be possible to see previous calculations with a history feature. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Calendar and Reminders</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Calendar app will allow users to manage Reminders. Users will be able to view events and tasks from Reminders in the Calendar. An updated Month View will also be available and both apps will see UI changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other new features </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iCloud</strong> – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device.

Now Game Porting Toolkit 2 adds the most-requested capabilities from game developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, improvements to Game Mode on the Mac will unlock smoother frame rates, and advanced power management features boost performance across the Mac lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple proudly shared details of several gaming titles that will be coming to the Mac, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Control Ultimate Edition </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frostpunk 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Palworld</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard </li>\n\n\n\n<li>RESIDENT EVIL 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RoboCop: Rogue City</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sniper Elite 4,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ubisoft Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown </li>\n\n\n\n<li>World of Warcraft: The War Within (coming later this year). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wuthering Waves</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple noted that they are “leveraging powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals across the Mac lineup” and that they are “taking advantage of the latest M3 family of chips to deliver breathtaking visuals with ray tracing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalized Spatial Audio will result in significantly reduced audio latency with AirPods Pro (2nd generation).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Intelligence features </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several reports over the past few months have indicated that Apple is doing a lot of work towards AI, and that generative AI (using AI to create content) will have a big role in macOS. Those reports weren’t wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s new personal intelligence system is coming to Mac, iPhone, and iPad with macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by Macs with an M-series chip though, so Intel Macs will not offer these new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Writing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing-focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Sequoia Writing tools\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3840w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Sequoia Writing tools\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3840w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Sequoia Writing tools\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3840w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-Writing-Tools-Rewrite-240610.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Images </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground, users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Photos </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Siri </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1016f70d2cbfa11e864d7bb4535e05d25fe2945e2ee8029cebb57c70597983d3","category":"Apple"}
