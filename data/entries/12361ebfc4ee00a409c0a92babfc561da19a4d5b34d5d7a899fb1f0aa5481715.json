Observing production trends and prototypes in these areas helps them anticipate design changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a distinctive camera module design characterized by a horizontal \"camera bar\" that spans the width of the device's upper rear section. The design is reminiscent of Google's Pixel series and represents a departure from previous iPhone camera layouts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLeaked renders suggest that the camera bar will house a single rear camera lens, positioned on the left side, with the flash located on the far right. The overall aesthetic is sleek and minimalist, in line with the iPhone 17 Air's ultra-thin profile, which is reported to be approximately 5.5mm thick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iphone-17-air-case.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3072\" height=\"4096\" /><div><em>iPhone 17 Air case (Image: Sonny Dickson)</em></div>\r<br />\nDespite its minimalism, the device is expected to feature MagSafe, an Action button, and a Camera Control button – as indicated by the cutout on the lower left side of the case shown in the above image. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/\">report at the weekend</a> said the iPhone 17 Air will have a Camera Control button, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-magsafe-action-button/\">dummy models previously shared by Dickson</a> reflect this.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.6-inch display with 120Hz ProMotion support, a Dynamic Island, a standard A19 chip rather than an A19 Pro chip, a 48-megapixel rear camera, Apple's custom-made C1 modem, and no physical SIM card slot worldwide. As usual, Apple should announce its new iPhone lineup around mid-September.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonny-dickson/\">Sonny Dickson</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/first-iphone-17-air-case-camera-bar-cutout/\">First iPhone 17 Air Case Has Camera Bar, Camera Control Button Cutouts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-iphone-17-air-case-has-camera-bar-camera-control-button-cutouts.2453488/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"12361ebfc4ee00a409c0a92babfc561da19a4d5b34d5d7a899fb1f0aa5481715","category":"Apple"}
