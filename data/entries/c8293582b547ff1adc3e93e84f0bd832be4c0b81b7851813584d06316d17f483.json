Well, some of them anyway. While some of the best deals are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9BXKF5/\">completely sold out</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-Laptop-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLHBYRPS/\">won’t arrive until January</a>, there are still some great bargains remaining—some of our favorites in fact. Here are the top 5 Apple deals still on sale, in stock, and ready to ship:</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBA-M3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBA-M3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBA-M3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBA-M3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBA-M3.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>M3 MacBook Air for $844</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Air is probably getting a new chip in just a few short months, but the current model is about as perfect of a laptop as you’re going to get. It’s got a great display, design, and keyboard–and it now comes with 16GB of RAM standard, all for under $850. That same laptop would’ve cost you $1,299 just a few months ago, a savings of over $450.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3\" target=\"_blank\">Get the M3 MacBook Air for $844</a></div>\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Apple-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple 2022 10,9&quot; iPad (Wi-Fi, 64 GB) 10. generation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Apple-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Apple-iPad.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Apple-iPad.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Apple-iPad.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Macwelt/Apple/Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>10th-gen iPad for $259</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the 10th-gen iPad went from a somewhat overpriced budget model to a killer entry-level bargain tablet with a $100 price cut. But its Black Friday price of $259 is a downright steal. Yes, it’s the only iPad Apple sells that isn’t able to run Apple Intelligence, but at this price, who cares? You’re getting a gorgeous 10.9-inch display, 64GB of storage, a 12MP Center Stage FaceTime camera, and all-day battery life for less than the price of a HomePod.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/\" target=\"_blank\">Get the 10th-gen iPad for $259</a></div>\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apple-airtags.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"apple-airtags\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apple-airtags.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apple-airtags.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apple-airtags.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>4-pack of AirTags for $73</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AirTags are absolutely the unsung hero of Apple’s accessory lineup, turning your non-Apple devices into smart trackable items that seamlessly hook into the same network that keeps tabs on our MacBooks and iPhones. Apple usually sells a 4-pack for $99, which is a decent price, but you can get four for just $73 at Amazon, bringing the per-AirTag price down to just $18.25, the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY\" target=\"_blank\">Get a 4-pack of AirTags for $73</a></div>\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Studio with Studio Display\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mac_studio_and_display.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Studio Display for $1,300</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Studio Display isn’t cheap, and even at this incredible sale price of $1,300, it’s more expensive than most laptops. But the $300 Black Friday discount brings it down to a reasonable, even attractive price. You’re not just getting a tremendous 5K retina display, a 12MP camera with Center Stage, a trio of studio-quality mics, and a six-speaker sound system with spatial audio, along with one Thunderbolt 3 port and three USB-C ports. For $1,300, that’s hard to beat.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3GZD32/\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Studio Display for $1,300</a></div>\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/airpods-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 Black Week\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/airpods-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/airpods-pro.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/airpods-pro.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/airpods-pro.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods Pro 2 for $154</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the ANC AirPods 4 available for $165, it would normally be hard to recommend the AirPods Pro 2, which have a five-year-old design and haven’t had a proper update and two years. But Apple keeps them fresh with new features, most recently an incredible Hearing Protection feature that uses a clinical-grade hearing test to turn the AirPods Pro into a bona fide hearing aid. And at nearly $100 off, it’s hard to recommend anything else.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro 2 for $154</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c8293582b547ff1adc3e93e84f0bd832be4c0b81b7851813584d06316d17f483","category":"Apple"}
