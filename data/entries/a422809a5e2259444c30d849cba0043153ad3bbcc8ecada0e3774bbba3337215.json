Created by a progressive mountain bike company, the new Mondraker Arid is still designed to go fast. But instead of pigeonholing it into one small niche, Mondraker built a versatile gravel all-rounder that is as happy to go racing as it is to spend a chill week bikepacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also happens to be the first-ever Mondraker to get internal frame storage. Maybe that’s something we’ll see come to mountain bikes soon, too?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Mondraker Arid carbon gravel bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Mondraker Arid carbon gravel bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All phots/Mondraker)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Get out of the saddle.

The new Mondraker Arid is the perfect ride whatever your idea of gravel. We’ve created something that moves, something truly authentic. Our way.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the silhouette of the new Mondraker Arid looks a bit familiar, that might be because last year Mondraker already debuted their first dropbar model, which curiously was the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-mondraker-dusty-gravel-e-bike-models-pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">Dusty gravel ebike</a> with a stealthy, almost-entirely-hidden Mahle ebike drive system. But while that gravel ebike might have been perfect for the Mondraker eMTB fans, this new Arid is for the Mondraker fans who want to push themselves fast and further after the pavement ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-jpg.webp\" alt=\"all-new Mondraker Arid carbon gravel bike, unique seatstay window\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_seatstay-window-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that I noticed was missing from the Dusty was Mondraker’s signature pierced headtube. But now, the Arid brings it back, well it brings it to the back. The new Mondraker Arid features a unique cutout window at the top of its seatstays, where it can provide a bit of vertical flex, while maintaining overall frame stiffness for solid handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gravel geometry designed by mountain bikers</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"all-new Mondraker Arid carbon gravel bike, riding like a mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_ride-it-like-a-mountain-bike-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mondraker describes the Arid’s gravel bike geometry as “innovative”, clearly inspired by their progressive mountain bike Forward Geometry. It features “<em>generous reach figures and stem lengths of between 60mm and 90mm depending on frame size, a 70° head angle, and 425mm chainstays</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a fit and feel meant to provide ample rider comfort, and still be “confidence-inspiring” when the terrain gets spicy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"all-new Mondraker Arid carbon gravel bike, up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-detail-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-detail-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-detail-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-detail-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>lightweight top-tier  Stealth Air carbon frame &amp; fork on all models</li>\n\n\n\n<li>integrated fully internal cable routing through the headset, accessible outside under the stem </li>\n\n\n\n<li>1x-only, compatible with mechanical &amp; electronic drivetrains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>internal frame storage in the downtube behind a watertight, dustproof &amp; locking hatch</li>\n\n\n\n<li>includes 3 zippered ‘Carry-On’ bags inside to keep your spares sorted &amp; secure</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 standard bottle cages, 1 under-downtube cage &amp; 1 toptube bag mounts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>plus 3-bolt Anything cage mounts low on each fork leg</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27.2mm round seatpost with external clamp</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12mm thru-axles &amp; flat mount disc brakes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>T47 threaded bottom bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UDH for max drivetrain compatibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>50mm max tire clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5 stock sizes available (S, M, M/L, L &amp; XL)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_complete-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_complete-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Mondraker Arid carbon gravel bike, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_complete-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_complete-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_complete-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_complete-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mondraker Arid – Pricing options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-jpg.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mondraker-Arid-carbon-gravel-bike_chill-vibes-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Four complete gravel bike builds, plus a separate frameset, round out the options to get your hands on the all-new Mondraker Arid carbon gravel bike.
