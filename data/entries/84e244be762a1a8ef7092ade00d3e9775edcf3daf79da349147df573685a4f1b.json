always bring a jacket when riding up at higher elevations. It’s not so much that I’m afraid of getting wet as I’m afraid of getting cold <em>after</em> I get wet. If you’re riding in the high country when a monsoon hits, you’re going to get soaked no matter what, but a rain jacket keeps your core warm as you descend to the lower (safer) elevations. Having an ultralight, Gore-Tex jacket also keeps you warm on cool mornings and packs down to nothing. Rapha just happened to make a jacket that matches <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/starling-cycles-murmur-v3-review/\" target=\"_blank\">my Starling Murmur</a> too… For those extra matchy-matchy moments.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Every-Ride-Carry-MTB-and-Gravel-Riding-Essentials-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Tool Bag: <a href=\"https://www.thisisfarewell.com/store/p/pk4rwu1m7ihoxrtgg1w0at1gccmkic\" target=\"_blank\">Farewell Zipper Pouch</a></h3>\n<p>I love pouches.

I carry a set of the Wolf Tooth Pack Pliers, with an extra 12-speed SRAM Eagle master link, which has come in handy more than a few times. The real day-saver is the Dynaplug Megapill Plug Kit, which holds a large plug for 1/8-3/16″ holes and several smaller plugs, for your standard tire tread or sidewall hole. I’ve had the CO2 cartridge for a few years, and, truthfully, I never need it, but I like having one just in case a tire goes flat, and I need to re-seat the bead.</p>\n<p>The backpacker in me always has a lighter, and my Lezyne pump is wrapped with a few rounds of Gorilla tape in case I need to make a makeshift tire boot, fix tubeless tape, or make a splint for an injury. I always have a knife for various reasons, but usually to slice apples or cured meat sticks.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ride.lezyne.com/collections/hand-pumps-mountain-bike/products/1-mp-alldr-v2m04\" target=\"_blank\">Lezyne Alloy Drive MTB pump</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crankbrothers.com/collections/m-series/products/m17\" target=\"_blank\">Crankbrothers M17 Multi-tool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/pack-pliers\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth Pack Pliers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dynaplug.com/megapill.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dynaplug Megapill Plug Kit</a></li>\n<li>Spare Dynaplugs</li>\n<li>25g CO2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benchmade.com/products/551-s30v\" target=\"_blank\">Benchmade Griptilian</a> knife</li>\n<li>Mini Bic Lighter</li>\n<li>Shrader/Presta adaptor</li>\n<li>Valve core remover</li>\n<li>Spare tube (29×2.6″ or 700×50″ equivalent)<em><br />\n</em></li>\n<li><em>Spare AXS Batteries (2 – if riding an AXS bike)<br />\n</em></li>\n<li><em>Spare CR2032 Batteries (if riding an AXS bike)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/dsc_2099.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pedalhomie/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Arce</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>\n<p>Lip Trip Chap Stick<br />\n<a href=\"https://supergoop.com/products/glow-stick-sunscreen\" target=\"_blank\">Supergoop! Glo Stick SPF 50</a></p>\n<p>The Glo Stick has been the best sunblock for my face, neck, and ears. It lasts about three hours and doesn’t seem to be affected by excessive sweat. As a precaution on high UV days, or on rides with a lot of sun exposure, I usually wear my Ibex sun hoodie (<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/packing-the-power-of-merino-wool-ibex-sun-hoodie-review/\" target=\"_blank\">read my review if you haven’t</a>) and apply this every hour just to be safe. On lower UV days, I’ll wear a riding shirt and just cover my entire head with Glo Stick. It doesn’t irritate my eyes or cause any skin irritation.</p>\n<p><strong>Filter:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.katadyngroup.com/us/en/8019639-katadyn-befree-0.6-us~p10915\" target=\"_blank\">Katadyn .6L Water Filter</a></p>\n<p>The Katadyn is a must-have when riding our backcountry trails. Most of our MTB trails and our nice gravel ride follow a drainage system, supplying water year-round for rides. Due to cattle grazing in the National Forest and Wilderness areas, these delicate riparian zones are contaminated by their feces. As such, a good, lightweight filter is necessary. Our water isn’t too silty here, so it works really well in our rivers and creeks. I have found it to get clogged easily in silty water though. What I like the most about this filer is how small it folds up.</p>\n<p><strong>First Aid:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.adventuremedicalkits.com/medical-kits/ultralight-watertight.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ultralight First Aid Kit by Adventure Medical Kits</a></p>\n<p>All you need for everything from road to rock rash, including mild anti-inflammatory drugs and pain relievers, the Adventure Medical Kits are super light, compact, and come in a waterproof zip pack.
