As Airbnb grew,\nwell-meaning people advised him that he had to run the company in\na certain way for it to scale. Their advice could be\noptimistically summarized as “hire good people and give them room\nto do their jobs.” He followed this advice and the results were\ndisastrous. So he had to figure out a better way on his own, which\nhe did partly by studying how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it\nseems to be working. Airbnb’s free cash flow margin is now among\nthe best in Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n<p>The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful\nfounders we’ve funded, and one after another said that the same\nthing had happened to them. They’d been given the same advice\nabout how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of\nhelping their companies, it had damaged them.</p>\n\n<p>Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was\nthe big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I\nfigured out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a\ncompany you hadn’t founded — how to run a company if you’re\nmerely a professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less\neffective that to founders it feels broken. There are things\nfounders can do that managers can’t, and not doing them feels\nwrong to founders, because it is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/founder-mode\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4c59d3ce9577ce0663518d71a2f83572bbfc0d389b630a9172ff0b650792c8b4","category":"Tech"}
