The company says its new code search is \"about twice as fast\" as the old code search and that it \"understands code, putting the most relevant results first.\"</p>\n<p>That's on top of redesigned search and code view interfaces. The new search interface offers suggestions and completions and categorizes and formats the results more intelligently.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937544#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937544&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d2312d4459526d47e8acdc14860014d1f41b84b669cfdf8fd46d07b23a92a10","category":"Tech"}
