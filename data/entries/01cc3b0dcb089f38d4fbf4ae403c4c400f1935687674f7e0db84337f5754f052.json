Details of the new R2 <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2024/03/04/rivian-r2-electric-suv-leaks-price-range/\">had leaked earlier this week</a>, although not entirely accurately—the new smaller EV will start at $45,000 (not $47,000) when it goes on sale in 2026.</p>\n<p>At first glance of the R2, you might be excused for thinking you're looking at a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/rivians-r1s-is-an-electric-suv-for-those-with-an-adventurous-lifestyle/\">Rivian R1S</a>, for both SUVs share a lot of styling details—not just Rivian's distinctive daylight running lights but also the overall shape of the vehicle. But the new car is shorter in both length (by 15.7 inches/400 mm) and height, and only offers two rows of seating, not three.</p>\n<p>Convenience improvements include a pair of gloveboxes under the dashboard and a flashlight that's stored in the door. At the back, the glass rear window can drop down to allow access to the cargo area. Both rows of seats fold flat, in case you want to camp in your car.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008759#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008759&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
