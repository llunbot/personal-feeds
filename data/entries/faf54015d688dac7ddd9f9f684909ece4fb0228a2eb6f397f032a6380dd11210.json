{"title":"‘Katie Knows Everything’","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2014/05/katie_cotton","date":1681241039000,"content":"\n<p>From the DF archive, my piece in 2014 remarking upon her retirement from Apple, with an anecdote from the iPhone 4 “antennagate” press conference in 2010:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I was wearing a large SLR camera on a strap around my neck. As I\nfiled in to find a seat, I was offered a choice: if I wanted to\ntake photos during the event, I could sit toward the back; if I\nwere willing to forgo taking photos, I could sit up front in the\nthird row. I only had my camera with me on a lark — the\nadvantages of publishing a website that runs photographs only\nrarely — so I took the seat in the third row. The first two rows,\nas usual, were occupied by senior Apple executives and employees.</p>\n\n<p>As I took my seat, Katie Cotton, sitting in the second row, smiled\nand greeted me. “Hi John, glad you could make it. How’s the cold?”</p>\n\n<p>I was feeling fine, the cold not much more than a memory at that\npoint, and told her so. But I had to ask, laughing, “How did you\neven know I had a cold?”</p>\n\n<p>Before she could answer, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=greg%20joswiak\">Greg Joswiak</a>, sitting directly in\nfront of me, turned around. “John, Katie knows <em>everything</em>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/11/katie-knows-everything\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"faf54015d688dac7ddd9f9f684909ece4fb0228a2eb6f397f032a6380dd11210","category":"Tech"}
