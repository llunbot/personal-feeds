You can get this display for <a href=\"https://howl.me/clq17ynFNDS\"><strong>$999.99</strong></a> on Samsung's website, down from $1,599.99.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/samsung-viewfinity-s9.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung.

The monitor is a good (and cheaper) alternative to Apple's Studio Display. The last time we tracked this deal was in early December, so if you've been waiting for a solid markdown on the Samsung display, now is definitely the time to buy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://howl.me/clq17ynFNDS\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$600 OFF</div>27-inch ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor for $999.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the ViewFinity display sale, Samsung has a few other monitor discounts right now.
