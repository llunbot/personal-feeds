However, the suit notes that “if necessary, a pro-rata portion of the Net Settlement Fund less than $20.” That means if lots of people opt in, the payments will be divided accordingly and could decrease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of the class should receive a notice with a Notice ID and Confirmation Code to confirm or update payment information anytime before April 10 online through the Payment Selection tab at the <a href=\"https://watchsettlement.com/home\">Watch Settlement site</a>. If you don’t receive a notice and are unsure whether you are included in the settlement, you can call 844-933-4042 for more information.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"76b84608f6c13ba6850abe5a0f77676cd8af9d4b8b4d67c6d974ba6ddd3bca11","category":"Apple"}
