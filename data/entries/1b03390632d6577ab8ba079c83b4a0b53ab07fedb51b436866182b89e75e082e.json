Lead moves from the pipes into the water when the plumbing experiences corrosion, which is most severe when the water is acidic or has low mineral content. There is no safe level of lead, which is a toxic metal with wide-ranging health effects, including neurotoxic effects. In children, lead exposure can damage the brain and nervous system, slow development, lower IQ, and cause learning, behavioral, speech, and hearing problems. In adults, it can increase the risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems, and kidney damage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-11/proposed-lcri_pre-pub-version-11_29_23.pdf\">The EPA estimates</a> that the rule will generate between $9.8 billion to $34.8 billion in economic benefits each year based on health improvement, including higher IQs in children, healthier newborns, lower cardiovascular risks in adults, and a reduction in care for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987594#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987594&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b03390632d6577ab8ba079c83b4a0b53ab07fedb51b436866182b89e75e082e","category":"Tech"}
