Over a period of 24 seconds, the small helicopter rose to an altitude 5 meters above the red planet's dusty surface and then touched back down in the same spot.</p>\n<p>During some of its past flights, <em>Ingenuity</em> has flown for nearly three minutes at a time and traversed as far as 700 meters across Martian terrain. In fact, after landing on Mars more than two years ago as part of the Perseverance mission, the helicopter is arguably one of NASA's greatest exploration feats of all time.</p>\n<p>Mission success for <em>Ingenuity</em> was completing five relatively short flights. However, since its first test flight in April 2021, the helicopter has exceeded all expectations by flying more than 50 different sorties across Mars and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/05/after-an-amazing-run-on-mars-nasas-helicopter-faces-a-long-dark-winter/\">surviving long and dark winters</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959510#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959510&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0aa12caaf47a9ddb953f53065a2c7af6b766af8d7609d8e8cc2b76b0324ff3dd","category":"Tech"}
