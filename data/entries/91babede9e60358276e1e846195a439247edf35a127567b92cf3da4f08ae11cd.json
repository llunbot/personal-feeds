That’s a problem. If drugs aren’t taken regularly, on time, and in the right doses, the treatment may not work, and the person’s condition can worsen.</p>\n<p>The issue isn’t that people are unwilling to take their prescriptions. It’s that some drugs, like HIV medications, require <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-treatment-adherence#:~:text=Why%20is%20medication%20adherence%20important,and%20produce%20drug%2Dresistant%20HIV.\">unwavering commitment</a>. And essential medicines, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/california-wants-to-make-cheap-insulin-heres-how-it-could-work/\">like insulin</a>, can be brutally expensive. Plus, the Covid pandemic illustrated the difficulties of delivering perishable follow-up vaccine shots to regions with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/a-possible-covid-vaccine-means-its-time-to-fix-cold-chains/\">no cold chain</a>. “Are we really squeezing all the utility out of those drugs and vaccines?” asks Kevin McHugh, a bioengineer at Rice University. “The answer is, in general, <i>no</i>. And sometimes we’re missing out on a lot.”</p>\n<p>For example, the injectable drug bevacizumab can be used to treat macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness. But even though it’s effective, dosing adherence is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32763265/\">notoriously low</a>. “People hate getting injections into their eyes,” McHugh says. “And I don’t blame them at all—that’s terrible.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950191#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950191&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91babede9e60358276e1e846195a439247edf35a127567b92cf3da4f08ae11cd","category":"Tech"}
