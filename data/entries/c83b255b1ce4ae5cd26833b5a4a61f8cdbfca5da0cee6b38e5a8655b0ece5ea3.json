Featuring a snug, body-mirroring fit, the Evolve Terra Seamless Jersey delivers the optimal combination of comfort and wind-cheating aero efficiency. Breathable, moisture-wicking fabric keeps riders cool and dry, and dual-yarn construction yields a unique two-tone design effect. A broad, seamless waistband keeps everything in the ideal riding position on rough terrain. Two rear pockets provide critical and secure carrying space for snacks and other ride essentials, while a seamless band across the top of the pockets alleviates sag, maintaining a snug fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"958\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cqq2deheou3gmqxn1jiy_1800x1800.webp\" alt=\"studio shot of a model wearing Shimano's Evolve gravel jersey\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cqq2deheou3gmqxn1jiy_1800x1800.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cqq2deheou3gmqxn1jiy_1800x1800-297x190.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cqq2deheou3gmqxn1jiy_1800x1800-120x77.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cqq2deheou3gmqxn1jiy_1800x1800-768x490.webp 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining Shimano’s Sterrato 2.0 endurance chamois and a large leg pocket for carrying extra gear and snacks, the Evolve Avventura Bibs are built for long days and varying conditions. Soft elastic leg bands with silicon grippers ensure a secure hold while pedaling without sacrificing comfort. Sturdy bib straps cross at the back, offering superior support and comfort for long days on the bike. One large pocket on the right leg offers convenient access for carrying important gear or snacks. Reflective piping and logos enhance visibility in low-light conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9.webp\" alt=\"A rider on a quiet gravel road at dusk, wearing Shimano S-Phhyre apparel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre9-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The color palette of Shimano’s gravel apparel is earthy, and takes inspiration from the tranquil vibes of roads like these.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2025 S-Phyre Road Range</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 S-Phyre road apparel range consists of the Leggera Short Sleeve Jersey, Leggera Bib Shorts, and Superlight vest. This is a system of apparel crafted for summer conditions and all-out efforts. The S-Phyre road collection is aesthetically on-trend, with minimal graphics and a color palette that, while subdued, features some sultry options. The fit is aero but still accommodating enough for endurance rides and various body types. Sizing has been adjusted to more closely match European sizing, so refer to the sizing guides of each item to be sure you’ll receive the ideal fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1.webp\" alt=\"A group of road riders wearing Shimano S-Phyre road apparel.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre1-720x480.webp 720w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leggera Jersey features reflective elements that enhance visibility in low-light riding conditions. Flat-lying pockets with elastic inner flaps minimize pocket sag, keeping contents secure while maintaining easy access. A lightweight elastic grip band on the back assures the jersey remains in the ideal riding position. Mesh side panels constructed from breathable recycled polyester help vent excess heat, while a light and stretchy mesh layer beneath the pockets further increases ventilation. The Leggera Jersey is made from 85% recycled polyester, lessening environmental impact throughout its product cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shimano_SS25_Road_2-231_900x.webp\" alt=\"Two riders descend in the desert wearing Shimano S-Phyre road apparel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shimano_SS25_Road_2-231_900x.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shimano_SS25_Road_2-231_900x-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shimano_SS25_Road_2-231_900x-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shimano_SS25_Road_2-231_900x-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shimano_SS25_Road_2-231_900x-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Shimano_SS25_Road_2-231_900x-720x480.webp 720w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leggera Bib Shorts utilize a bonded laser cut design with minimal seams to deliver a light, breathable, and sleek fit that snugly hugs the body for enhanced comfort and maximum aerodynamic efficiency. Constructed from supportive Renew Prime fabric from Carvico, the S-PHYRE Leggera Bib Shorts provide the ideal combination of compressive support and comfort-enhancing stretch so you can maintain peak performance. This cutting-edge shell holds with a premium Italian-made In Fuga chamois that features the patented Free-Flow system, which provides breathable shock-absorbing comfort without unwanted bulk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S-Phyre Superlight Vest is a packable vest ideal for variable weather conditions. Anatomical 3D construction and stretchy material provide a wrinkle-free aero-enhancing fit, while the durable dual-direction YKK zipper lets you vent heat on the fly and makes it easy to open the lower area of the vest when you need to get into your jersey’s back pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The women’s S-Phyre collection also includes the Leggera Jersey and Bibs, but there is no women’s-specific Superlight Vest offered at this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4.webp\" alt=\" A rider rides through the desert in Shimano's S-Phyre apparel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/S-Phyre4-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The minimal aesthetic of Shimano’s S-Phyre Range lets your legs do the talking.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ride.shimano.com/collections/apparel-all\">ride.shimano.com/collections/apparel-all</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-rolls-out-new-s-phyre-road-and-gravel-apparel/\">Shimano Rolls Out New S-Phyre Road and Gravel Apparel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c83b255b1ce4ae5cd26833b5a4a61f8cdbfca5da0cee6b38e5a8655b0ece5ea3","category":"Cycling"}
