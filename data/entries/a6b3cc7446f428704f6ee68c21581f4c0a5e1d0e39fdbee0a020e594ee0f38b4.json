It’s like running a virtual version of your iPhone right there on the Desktop. However, you may encounter problems getting iPhone Mirroring to work because of the many requirements and settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check the requirements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To use iPhone Mirroring, you need iOS 18 installed on your iPhone as well as Sequoia on your Mac. The Mac must be an Apple silicon model (M-series processor) or a later-generation Intel Mac with a T2 Security Chip. Fortunately, few Intel models that lack that chip can even run Sequoia, so you’re unlikely to come across that scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be in any region except the European Union, where iPhone Mirroring is not supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because mirroring leans on Continuity, Apple’s term for a range of iOS/iPad/macOS integrated features, both your iPhone and Mac have to meet Continuity requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The same Apple Account must be signed into.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Apple Account needs to have two-factor authentication enabled.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bluetooth and Wi-Fi must be on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The devices must be near each other. Apple doesn’t document that last point, but it uses Bluetooth both for part of the authentication process and for proximity checking.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, your iPhone must be locked, though it can be set to use <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph878d77632/ios\">StandBy</a>. Your Mac can’t be sharing its internet connection (via <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Sharing</em> &gt; <em>Internet Sharing</em>), and may not be actively using AirPlay or Sidecar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Troubleshooting iPhone Mirroring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can run into trouble getting iPhone Mirroring to work if you have a VPN enabled or are using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for what Apple calls “intensive” use, like streaming. Disable the VPN or stop streaming and see if it works then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try resetting iPhone Mirroring settings in the macOS app in i<em>Phone Mirroring</em> &gt; <em>Settings</em>: click <em>Revoke Access to I[Phone name]</em>. Then try connecting again.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mac911-iphone-mirroring-settings-bordered_5f7bea.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mac911-iphone-mirroring-settings-bordered_5f7bea.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mac911-iphone-mirroring-settings-bordered_5f7bea.png?resize=300%2C134&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mac911-iphone-mirroring-settings-bordered_5f7bea.png?resize=768%2C344&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"458\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Revoke access to your iPhone as one step in troubleshooting.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a last resort, restart your Mac and iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
