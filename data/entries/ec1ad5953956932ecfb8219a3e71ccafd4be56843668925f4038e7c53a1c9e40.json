the model that is discounted to make sure you know exactly what you are buying and what it’s really worth. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>We’ve seen resellers switch to selling refurbished or used when the stock of brand-new models run out, so check that the model discounted isn’t actually a used Mac and therefore not as good a deal as it might look. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>That’s not to say you should avoid refurb models – you just need to make sure that you aren’t buying refurb without knowing. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac deals aren’t limited to Black Friday. We see good deals all year round, so don’t feel pressured into buying during Black Friday. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best MacBook deals in Apple’s Black Friday sale</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Apple holds its own Black Friday shopping event</a>, but rather than offering discounts it just gives gift vouchers with certain products.
