Apple’s release notes merely state that the update fixes “an issue that may cause iPhone to run warmer than expected,” real-world tests have shown that the update dramatically lowers temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-overheating-resolved-thermal-photos-before-and-after-ios-17-0-3/&amp;xcust=1-1-2095278-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">testing done by ZDNet’s Jason Hiner</a>, the update lowers temperatures by as much as 15 degrees at its hottest moment. Hiner experienced overheating while reviewing the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and found that the Pro Max got up to 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit (41.2 degrees Celsius) while charging. He also experienced heating issues when using the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://halide.cam/&amp;xcust=1-1-2095278-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Halide</a> camera app.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Phone 15 thermal tests by zdnet\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-15-thermail-testing-zdnet.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>ZDNet</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After Apple released the 17.0.3 update, Hiner installed it and charged the phones. The temperature peaked at 93.8 degrees Fahrenheit (34.3 degrees Celsius), and fluctuated between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 and 32.2 degrees Celsius). Hiner also noted that the update did not affect performance on the phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple responded to widespread reports of the iPhone 15 overheating with three possible causes: excessive activity when setting up a new iPhone, issues with apps that had recently been updated, and a bug within iOS 17. Along with the iOS 17.0.3 update, Apple is working with app developers to diagnose any potential performance issues with the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you have a new iPhone 15, install the iOS 17.0.3 update (it also has important security updates). If you haven’t bought one yet and plan to do so soon, the update should appear for installation as you set up the phone.</p>\n\niOS, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"167856c75a92827515f167e671f3daa6fd3a2b41b82ddc65ddbcaabd0ec3932d","category":"Apple"}
