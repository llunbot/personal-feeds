My research examines how desert plants and soils respond to precipitation extremes, like drought and flooding. While the choice to pursue a Ph.D. grants the privilege to follow one’s curiosity—to answer the most pressing questions of our time freely—it is often accompanied by self-deprecation and burnout, especially near the end of the doctoral journey. I remember being a bright-eyed first-year doctoral student meeting some jaded and very tired sixth-year students, thinking to myself that my passion and energy simply would never dwindle like theirs did! Humility sure is a sneaky teacher.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Part 3 of the very official <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.life/Survive-Graduate-School\" target=\"_blank\">WikiHow “How to Survive Graduate School” Guide</a> suggests “leaving school at school” and “allow time for fun.” For example, lean into hobbies. I love to <a href=\"https://courtneycurrier.com/art\" target=\"_blank\">paint watercolors</a>, but the prospect of sitting at another desk with the requirement to concentrate on a task felt like more work. And, as someone who tends towards unnecessary perfectionism in her work, the idea of art as a form of relaxation just seemed to be a paradox. To unwind, I instead opted for low-metabolic activities on the couch or barstool.</p>\n<p>However, these habits just did not jive well with the 2020 global pandemic. Like so many others, I was confined to my apartment for work. Moving ten feet over to the couch to watch TV after a long day hunched over my laptop in the kitchen seemed objectively depressing at times. I needed to get outside! The bicycle became an important tool for me to cope with the tribulations of graduate school and reconnect with nature beyond the Ph.D. field work, beyond the walls of my apartment.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Courtney-Bombora-9.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Equipped with a gorgeous and highly versatile <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/courtney-reviews-her-crust-bombora-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Crust gravel bike that I built</a>, biking in desert landscapes suddenly gave me a new appreciation for the ecologies I studied throughout my Ph.D. For example, I found new perspectives and happiness while riding the <a href=\"https://www.monumentalloop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Monumental Loop</a> with my friend and fellow Ph.D. candidate Sam Jordan. Notably, the Monumental Loop circumnavigates our field site at the Jornada Basin, north of Las Cruces, NM, and provided for us a therapeutic reflection of our time and efforts there.</p>\n<p>By adopting some healthier physical and mental habits, I also gathered energy to return to art. When creative inspiration struck, I started to intentionally follow that call and witnessed my evolution as an artist. Simultaneously, the anxiety and internal stress—souvenirs acquired during grad school—also started to calm. Inspiration can manifest in many ways. Most directly, I painted the beautiful landscapes around me in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/03/Ruta2022-160.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>My gravel bike also brought me to unique bike communities in the southwest, and inspiration became further activated by events like Sarah Swallow’s <a href=\"https://www.rutadeljefe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruta del Jefe</a>. The bicycle is a tool to traverse and enjoy landscapes, and so the purpose of Ruta del Jefe was to raise awareness and funds for pressing humanitarian and environmental issues in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands region, where so many cyclists enjoy the spectacular Patagonian grasslands and smooth, packed gravel roads.</p>\n<p>Related to these important initiatives, I made paintings for an art initiative called <a href=\"https://www.thirstforhumanity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Thirst for Humanity</a> that raised funds for local agencies that provide legal and humanitarian aid to migrants. This pushed my artistic focus into even more intentional topics than the dreamy transcendentalism of landscapes alone.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>A Different Kind of Bike Build</h3>\n<p><em>Sometimes, inspiration also strikes in rather unexpected ways.</em></p>\n<p>“Is that a… unicorn vomiting a rainbow?!” A question I receive often regarding the head badge affixed to my 1991 bonded metal Koga Miyata; the answer is “Yes, that is indeed a unicorn vomiting a rainbow.” Followed up by “Where did you get that?!” I am so pleased to share the amazing mixed-metal creations by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jengreenheadbadges/\" target=\"_blank\">Jen Green</a> if you have not seen her work! With refreshed motivation to stay sane while I finished school, I merged my loves for art, ecology, and bicycles. This unicorn head badge became the cornerstone for a side project that would provide the perfect amount of whimsy to distract me from the ennui of my last Ph.D. dissertation chapter. What started as a “simple” bar bike endeavor became a symbol of both fantastical escapism and self-love.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I wanted to build a simple fixed-gear bike with a streamlined and colorful look. One night while imbibing at the local Tempe dive, the Palo Verde Lounge, fellow cyclist Mike Morgan (and bartender at the famous “Dirty Verde”) strongly encouraged me to find a frame with rear-facing dropouts if I’d be riding fixed. The challenge was that I wanted a vintage steel frame, with a pretty crowned fork and cool seat stay angles and whatnot. Many folks considered such a frame a unicorn; I’d never find one reasonably priced.</p>\n<p>And yet, that same night while doom-scrolling on the couch, I came across an eBay page with bikes aplenty. A small, white 1970’s steel frame with rear-facing dropouts caught my eye. It was perfect. I e-mailed the seller, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gt_track_connoisseur/\" target=\"_blank\">a nice stranger</a> who kindly responded to my ramblings about unique bikes and car-less lifestyles and gave me a deal. The frame was owned by a woman who raced at <a href=\"https://velodrome.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Marymoor</a> in the ’70s/’80s, which made it extra badass. And thus, the unicorn frame materialized to match its head badge, and I immersed myself in a new artistic outlet.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-33.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Spray.Bike Review</h3>\n<p>New-to-me frame in hand, I stripped the bike to the raw metal. Amalfi Powder Coating in northwest Phoenix gladly took the job. I love these kinds of places; they’ll sandblast pretty much anything and were politely inquisitive about my next steps. I consulted friend and artist Lance Turner about paint, and he directed me to <a href=\"https://spraybike.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Spray.Bike</a>. They have thorough instructions and a trove of primers, colors, and topcoats to choose from.</p>\n<p>I hung my bike in my apartment complex courtyard, applied a coat of the Frame Builder’s Metal Primer, and, after 48 hours of drying, lightly wet sanded the frame using 220-grit sandpaper and again with 320-grit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1616\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/art-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/art-2.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/art-2.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/art-2.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/art-2.jpg?resize=1335,892&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/art-2.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/art-2.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1616\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/globemallow.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/globemallow.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/globemallow.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/globemallow.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/globemallow.jpg?resize=1335,892&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/globemallow.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/globemallow.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1616\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/salt-river.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/salt-river.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/salt-river.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/salt-river.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/salt-river.jpg?resize=1335,892&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/salt-river.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/salt-river.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>It was time for the color. My favorite flower is the desert globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.), which became the inspiration for my bike’s color palette. I took a recent visit to the banks of the Salt River near Phoenix, AZ, and was absolutely floored by the carpets of globemallow that covered the normally bare-soil patches of ground. Our desert ecosystem became the caricature of a jungle due to an unusually rainy 2023 winter, a special treat for an ecologist and outdoor enthusiast like me!</p>\n<p>I chose Peacock and Milan Celadon 1 for the frame color and was ambitious enough to try a fade. I chose accents of orange and pink, an homage to globemallow flower petals, along with splashes of other colors reminiscent of dreamy desert sunsets and unicorns to perfectly complement the green frame.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1500&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1-original-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1536&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1500&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/2-sandblasted-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1536&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The paint is advertised as a dry matte powder coating, and it really did feel like a powder coat in a can! If you do this, do not forget to wear a respirator or appropriate mask. Application was even and easy when following the recommended distances of 2-4”.</p>\n<p>To create the fade, it was important to isolate the transition spots between the two colors. I scrounged up as much spare newspaper as possible to block off parts of the frame I wanted to avoid speckling with the minty Milan color. I should have newspapered my whole courtyard. Luckily, the green paint clandestinely looked like moss all over the walkways.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,768&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1500&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1350&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1001&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/9-mint-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1536&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>With the Milan can, I started in the solid mint area with regular pressure on the can nozzle and worked up to the color transition to Peacock. At that transition, I steadily pulled the can farther away, so only about half or less of the paint reached the frame. A smooth and slow flick of the wrist is a motion that worked well for this part.</p>\n<p>Finally, I allowed the frame to dry for at least one full day, although Spray.Bike says 2 hours are enough to cure. My favorite part was covering the entire frame in Keirin Paint (Flake Multi). Possessing a highly controversial stance, I believe everything should be covered in sparkles!

No one seems to make a 110 mm rear track hub, so my options were to get an old hub, or try re-spacing a new one which ideally uses cartridge bearings and a fully threaded axle.</p>\n<p>When I was ordering the Velocity rims, I asked if they thought their track hub could be re-spaced and—after being left on hold for a few minutes—I was told that it can’t officially, but maybe. Re-spacing any hub involves rummaging through bins of lock-nuts to find some parts that have the right thread pitch. It worked. The rest of the wheel build was straightforward: I had Courtney look at color sequences using <a href=\"https://industrynine.com/anolab\" target=\"_blank\">Industry Nine’s “anolab”</a>, which I then transferred to the spoke holes on the rims with a permanent marker.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I like to build my wheels with the slimmest round silver spokes available, and I use linseed oil on the threads. I like the weight and how the structure of thinner spokes draws the stress away from weak points, and I dislike how most spoke preps contain ammonia which inevitably starts galvanic corrosion of the nipples. The extrusion for Velocity rims is made somewhere here in the Phoenix Valley: Velocity is one of two alloy rim manufacturers to have their whole manufacturing based in the USA, as far as I know. Velocity rims build up really well, and I have been using the A23 tubeless on my commuter for a couple of years with no issues, so I know from personal experience that these wheels will be stellar.</p>\n<p>Prepping the frame, I discovered that the isopropanol we use in the shop dissolved part of the paint system, so I had Courtney topcoat the frame again with Rustoleum clear lacquer (the kind you put on patio furniture).

The crown race was extremely tight for what it measured, which equated to a long battle, and ultimately needed massaging with a micro-file to de-burr the situation. This only revealed that the first two headsets ordered had a stack that was way too high for the very short steerer on the fork.</p>\n<p>The technical drawings for the Tange Levin NJS headset are off by over 3 mm, leaving no threads for the locknut. I ended up having to use a Tange CDS from my parts bin to get the bike rolling. I fail to understand why headsets fight me more often than not on 1” threaded frames, though I am sure the industry is rolling its eyes and reminding me that they are now dinosaurs, remnants of a pre-millennium era… Just like me, which is why my stable has 9 (complete) bikes with 1” steerers, though two are actually threadless.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-39.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-27.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The finishing touches (bar tape, pink housing, green cable ends) helped tie the whole project down to reality.

My serious side resides in a rarely-updated blog called <a href=\"http://weightweenus.com/it-weighs-a-fart/\" target=\"_blank\">The Weight Weenus</a> and—on that note—I have succeeded in opening and closing with the mention of farts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-41.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Closing</h3>\n<p>Doing a Ph.D. is a lot like going for a long bike ride: it’s a pain in the ass. And yet, both labors of love leave you with an enormous sense of accomplishment. And, like my degree, this bike build could not have been completed without help from friends. As I wrap up this chapter of my life, I am so excited to carry a piece of the beautiful southwest deserts of North America with me to the shores of the North Atlantic.</p>\n<p>It’s funny how sentimental we can become about objects… when I look down at the whir of colors flashing from my new wheels, the lovingly applied paint, and Tobias’ thoughtful customizations, I truly feel the joy of finishing my Ph.D. marked by the joy of finishing and riding this bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Courtneys-Matsuri-36.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Bike Specs</h3>\n<p>Year: 1970s<br />\nFrame: Matsuri<br />\nFork: Tange (probably original to frame, with extended braces on the inside of the blades)<br />\nFrame Color: Spray.Bike Peacock, Milan Celadon 1, and Keirin Paint (Multi Flake)<br />\nRims: Velocity A23<br />\nTires: Vittoria Rubino Pro<br />\nSpokes: Sapim Laser, Pro Wheel Builder nipples in pink, orange, gold, light green, green, turquoise, blue, and purple.<br />\nFront Hub: Velocity<br />\nRear Hub: Velocity (reduced from 120 mm to 110 mm)<br />\nSaddle: Brooks B17<br />\nSeatpost: Kalloy Uno Advanced Project<br />\nCrankset: Sugino RD2<br />\nHandlebars: Cinelli<br />\nLevers: Tektro<br />\nTape: Snack.Bike Tropical Sherbert<br />\nHeadbadge: @jengreenheadbadges</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/finding-joy-through-art-ecology-bikes-spray-bike-review/\">Unicorns and Sparkles and Rainbows: Finding Joy through Art, Ecology, and Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e91dbd707efd3b7825232a9b5f0b498ffa5209d4bbd219e643e4ea1f7679d643","category":"Cycling"}
