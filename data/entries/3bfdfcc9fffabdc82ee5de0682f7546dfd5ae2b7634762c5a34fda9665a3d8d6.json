To catalog and examine Google's moves in this new era of generative AI, Ars Technica is hiring a Senior Technology Reporter to focus on Google, AI, Android, and search. While attention to so-called \"consumer products\" will be important, this role will be more focused on Google's big moves as a technology and infrastructure company, moves often made to counter perceived threats from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Perplexity. Informed skepticism is the rule around here, so we're looking for someone with the chops to bring a critical eye to some deep technical and business issues.</p>\n<p>As this is a senior role owning an important beat, it is not an entry-level position. We're looking for someone who can primarily self-direct when it comes to their reporting and someone who is comfortable working remotely within a similarly remote team. We'd also like someone who can bring to the table deep and intelligent analyses on broader Google topics while also hitting smaller daily news stories.</p>\n<p>This is a full-time union job with benefits.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038555#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038555&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3bfdfcc9fffabdc82ee5de0682f7546dfd5ae2b7634762c5a34fda9665a3d8d6","category":"Tech"}
