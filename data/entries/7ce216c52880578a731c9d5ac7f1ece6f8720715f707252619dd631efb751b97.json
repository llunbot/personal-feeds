Attackers are able to deliver targeted ads for malicious software based on location, operating system, software, and search terms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAtomic Stealer (AMOS), an information stealer that surfaced in 2023, is used regularly, and a version of AMOS referred to as Poseidon has becoming increasingly popular with criminals. Poseidon is advertised as being able to steal cryptocurrency from more than 160 wallets as well as passwords from web browsers and select password managers. Poseidon downloads have masqueraded as legitimate Mac apps like the Arc Browser, tricking unsuspecting Mac users into installing the malware.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMalwarebytes warns that macOS stealers like Poseidon allow criminals to access sensitive resources, steal credentials, and create convincing social engineering attacks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo avoid this kind of attack, it is important to verify where software is being downloaded from, ensuring that it comes from a legitimate developer and not an imitation website.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/malware/\">Malware</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/malwarebytes/\">Malwarebytes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/mac-malware-stealers-increase/\">'Stealers' Are an Increasingly Common Mac Malware</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/stealers-are-an-increasingly-common-mac-malware.2448853/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7ce216c52880578a731c9d5ac7f1ece6f8720715f707252619dd631efb751b97","category":"Apple"}
