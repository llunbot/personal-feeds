{"title":"Best cheap VPN Deals: The cheapest VPNs for Mac, iPhone or iPad","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/673709/vpn-deals-for-mac.html","date":1725293401000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to unblock regional content on streaming services like Netflix, iPlayer, and Prime, or access websites that aren’t available in your region, a VPN is an essential tool. VPN services can also give you online privacy as well as letting you securely connect to open Wi-Fi networks in cafes, hotels, airports and other places. We can help you find the cheapest VPN to suit your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing which VPN service to subscribe to can be difficult and this is compounded by the fact that there are so many offers and discounts. That’s where we come in. All of the services you’ll find below are ones we’d use ourselves – and we do so daily. We’ll let you know the latest prices and best deals so you can find the VPN that suites you at the best price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668852/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-a-mac.html\">How to use a VPN on a Mac</a> for more information, and if you still aren’t sure why you need a VPN read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678391/should-i-use-a-vpn-on-my-mac-iphone.html\">Should I use a VPN on my Mac/iPhone?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best VPN deals right now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All these deals save a significant amount compared to paying for each of these services on a rolling monthly subscription. VPN providers tend to offer year-round discounts, however there are some deals that mean you won’t be locked into a monthly fee, or at least not one that will expire soon. Here are two of the best examples: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One deal to take a look at is <a href=\"https://fastestvpn.com/lifetime-special-deal\" target=\"_blank\">FastestVPN’s Lifetime plan</a> – which with 93% off makes it an absolute bargain as you pay once and have access to the VPN for life. It’s a one-off $40 (approx £33) and the company says that the full price would be $600.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We have plenty more deals below. Note that many of the deals lock you in for a year or two years after which you can end up paying a lot more, so check out the advertised monthly price. We recommend setting a reminder in your calendar to cancel and look for a new deal to replace the one you had at the end of the contract period. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best free VPN </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few free VPNs on offer but our advice is usually to be very cautious about them. Companies that give stuff away will be making money somehow, and you can’t be sure they aren’t selling your data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One decent VPN that does offer a free tier is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345937/protonvpn-review.html\">Proton VPN (read our review)</a>. You can use Proton VPN for nothing, as long as you’re happy with U.S., Japan, and Netherlands as your server locations. It’s also limiting in that you can only connect a single device, and speeds are slower than the paid plans, but the free version is available on all platforms and if you like it you can always subscribe to get the whole package which will unblock a host of features, including an ad and tracker blocker and improved speed of up to 10 Gbit, as well as an expanded 10-device limit. There’s Port Forwarding for downloads and gaming, too, as well as a Kill Switch for disconnecting should the VPN drop out.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn\" target=\"_blank\">Get Proton VPN free</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>Best cheap VPNs for Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re reviewed all these services in our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668698/best-vpn-for-mac-2.html\">best VPNs for Mac</a>. Below you will find details of the best deals available currently for each of the major VPN providers – these deals change all the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most VPNs cost less than $5/£5 per month, with some less than $3/£3. There are even some free VPNs, but these are usually very limited and could be collecting data about you.

Prices rarely exceed $6/£6 per month with multi-year subscriptions and are often closer to $2/£2… or even less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many major VPN providers offer discounts through the year, and sometimes even offer permanent discounts. These discounts can look impressive at first. It’s not uncommon to see a countdown timer telling you when the deal ends – but these are almost always to induce FOMO – the fear of missing out – in order to persuade you to sign up immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large discounts are par for the course with VPN services, especially when you’re subscribing for several years. This makes it all the more important to look into the various providers and what each has to offer, before jumping into a long-term commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All VPNs we’ve tested offer cross-device coverage too, so you can use them on your Mac, iPhone, iPad and more.
