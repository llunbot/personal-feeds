These glasses are for taking pictures and conversing with an AI assistant. Apple is said to have discussed the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-still-exploring-smart-glasses-meta-ray-bans/\">making similar glasses</a> to compete in the same space. Apple's rationale seems to be that creating smart glasses could be a precursor to developing true AR glasses further in the future. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also said to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/\">adding AI-enabled cameras</a> to the Apple Watch and AirPods over the next couple of years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been rumors about Apple's work on AR glasses – aka Apple Glass – for almost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/14/apple-ar-smart-glasses-in-development/\">10 years now</a>, and the Vision Pro headset is what Apple built because the technology doesn't yet exist for the kind of augmented reality glasses that Apple is aiming for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has previously reported that Apple is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces, and that the company is working on a version of visionOS that will run on glasses. Codenamed \"Atlas,\" the studies are being led by Apple's Product Systems Quality team, part of the hardware engineering division.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/apple-ceo-tim-cook-hell-bent-true-ar-glasses/\">Apple CEO 'Hell Bent' on Launching True AR Glasses Before Meta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-hell-bent-on-launching-true-ar-glasses-before-meta.2455275/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2100d758844ff9be94b8336843e158eeebd981df0a71ba83508de6e075c5a060","category":"Apple"}
