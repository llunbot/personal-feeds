HP is framing its service as a way to simplify printing for families and small businesses, but the deal also comes with monitoring and a years-long commitment.</p>\n<p>Prices range from $6.99 per month for a plan that includes an HP Envy printer (the current model is the 6020e) and 20 printed pages. The priciest plan includes an HP OfficeJet Pro rental and 700 printed pages for $35.99 per month.</p>\n<p>HP says it will provide subscribers with ink deliveries when they're running low and 24/7 support via phone or chat (although it's dubious how much you want to <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/news/hp-tech-support-showdown\">rely on HP support</a>). Support doesn't include on or offsite repairs or part replacements. The subscription's terms of service (<a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/all-in-plan/terms.html\">TOS</a>) note that the service doesn't cover damage or failure caused by, unsurprisingly, \"use of non-HP media supplies and other products\" or if you use your printer more than what your plan calls for.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007071#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007071&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa9bd25944d315d044ef668bc0e5105df6c30ad6fac249a4835aeae959328b31","category":"Tech"}
