The prior design was graphics heavy, featuring a large banner with people using various Apple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-id-website-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLogging in to the ‌Apple ID‌ website presents all of the available ‌Apple ID‌ management options in a card-style view, plus there are navigation options on the left.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-id-website-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe card view offers information at a glance, like your ‌Apple ID‌, your notification email, whether you have two-factor authentication enabled, and the last time that your password was updated. Clicking through the navigation options brings up more info like your name, birthday, reachable email addresses, device list, payment options, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe entire website is simple, responsive, and easy to navigate, and it's quicker than the prior website. The new look is a definite improvement over the previous design for those who need to manage their Apple IDs on the web.
