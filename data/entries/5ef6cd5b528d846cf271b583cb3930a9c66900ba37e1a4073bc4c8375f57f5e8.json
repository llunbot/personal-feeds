That is scary. Kopecky has been utterly supreme in 2023, only coming unstuck at Strade Bianche, when she was pipped to the line by her own teammate. She came second here in 2022 and if she doesn’t win it’ll be an upset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After such an imperious display at her home race the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-2023-highlights\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Flanders</a> last weekend when she was also expected to win, you can be sure she won’t be phased by expectations, and Roubaix suits her better than Flanders anyway, with a massive engine and a mighty sprint if she’s not alone in the velodrome. It’s Kopecky’s to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Elisa Longo Borghini</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/02144436/elisa_longo_borghini_wins_on_the_black_mountain_swpix-970x581.jpg\" alt=\"elisa_longo_borghini_wins_on_the_black_mountain_swpix\" /><figcaption>SWPix</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Defending champion Elisa Longo Borghini had to take some time out this season after contracting Covid, but her return to racing saw 11th at Dwars door Vlaanderen and a hard-fought third at the Tour of Flanders. With the hills her undoing in De Ronde and with an extra week of recovery, Longo Borghini should absolutely be competing for back-to-back Roubaixs on Saturday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, she has the fortune of being on the only team to ever win Paris-Roubaix Femmes (albeit there’s only one winner other than her), and teammates Lucinda Brand, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-balsamo-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Elisa Balsamo</a> and Shirin van Anrooij could all do a job should Longo Borghini not be on a good day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marianne Vos</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Marianne Vos celebrates winning a stage at Tour de France Femmes 2022\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/gcn-advertorial-vos.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Cyclingimages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Marianne Vos won’t want to retire without a Paris-Roubaix cobble on her mantlepiece. The race suits her down to the ground with her abilities off-road and huge engine, she came second to Lizzie Deignan in the rain in 2021 but was a DNS in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three race days so far this year have been top 20s in the very hilly Trofeo Alfredo Binda and Tour of Flanders, and third at the flatter Dwars door Vlaanderen. At the berg-less Roubaix, will Vos be boss? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The outsiders</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order, you should also be keeping your eyes on: Lucinda Brand, Silvia Persico, Shirin van Anrooij, Lorena Wiebes, Pfeiffer Georgi, Marta Bastianelli, Elise Chabbey and Floortje Mackaij.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Men’s Paris-Roubaix 2023 favourites</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/03015129/paris-roubaix_cobble_hoppers_05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alex Duffil, Alice Alphrey / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the GOAT, Tadej Pogačar, won’t be lining up to add a fourth Monument to his set on Sunday, this generation’s greatest rivalry will be going at it again and unsurprisingly they’re the bookies’ favourites, alongside a few equally capable riders with a massive opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wout van Aert</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"719\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-6-970x719.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-6-970x719.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-6-300x222.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-6-768x569.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-6-750x556.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-6-1140x845.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-6.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Gruberimages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tables have turned, and Wout van Aert is the favourite for this one after Mathieu van der Poel was favoured for Flanders. Van Aert finished second last year behind now-teammate <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-balsamo-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Dylan van Baarle</a>, so that’s one challenger down already. Yes he didn’t make the final selection last weekend but the lack of hills will help keep his legs fresh and enable his teammates to stay at the front of the race for longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A win here would be absolutely huge for Wout’s legacy, with only one Monument to his name so far to Van der Poel’s three, and he looks well placed to do it. He’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-johan-museeuw\" target=\"_blank\">Johan Museeuw’s pick</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mathieu van der Poel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-19-970x566.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-19-970x566.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-19-300x175.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-19-768x448.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-19-750x438.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-19-1140x665.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-19.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Gruberimages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Wout has been cleaning up the semi-<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a>, Van der Poel has a Monument win and Monument runner-up. He seems truly at his best in 2023 and that is frightening for anyone else with hopes of victory. He’ll need to be forced into tricky situations like getting dropped in crosswinds in Flanders or like getting completely cooked and giving an actual sprinter a free ride in Roubaix 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winning on Sunday would turn MvdP’s season from incredible to legendary, and a third Monument to match Tadej Pogačar’s tally and leave just two for the set would be massive. Although he’s a lot less likely to get all five with the Lombardia parcours, with Van der Poel you absolutely would not write him off. If he doesn’t win Roubaix in his career it’ll be seen as a massive failure for a rider with such road and off-road pedigree. He’ll certainly be up for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mads Pedersen</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-28-970x625.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-28-970x625.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-28-300x193.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-28-768x495.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-28-750x483.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-28-1140x734.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-28.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Gruberimages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mads-pedersen-qa\" target=\"_blank\">Mads Pedersen</a> <em>really </em>wants to win Paris-Roubaix and the race suits the Dane down to the cobbled ground. Known to thrive in the most difficult conditions, he’s the northern Wout with sprinting his forte but hills not out of his reach and Classics certainly his wheelhouse. He put in a strong shift in Flanders to beat Van Aert in the sprint for third and spent a while leading the race solo. If his legs survived, he’ll be at the front again. The former World Champion has been doubted despite his achievements and winning Roubaix would put any of that to bed. The bookies have him as third favourite, so clearly not everyone doubts him. The forecast is dry though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Filippo Ganna</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-970x646.jpeg\" alt=\"ganna_hour_record_win\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125628/ganna_hour_record_win.jpeg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Ineos Grenadiers</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Filippo Ganna had been written in as a Paris-Roubaix winner before he’d ever taken to the cobbles, and he didn’t have the ideal race on his debut in 2022, but his teammate won, so it was a success right? Paris-Roubaix suits riders with big engines and engines don’t come bigger than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/filippo-ganna-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Hour Record dominator</a>. He won’t want to come to the finish with any of the aforementioned names, but he has shown off a mighty sprint this year, including at Milan-San Remo, where he beat Wout van Aert into second. After sacrificing road form for the Hour in 2022, Ganna’s hoping his next scalp is Paris-Roubaix, and when he wins that? No one is safe.

His fate rests on whether he needs to help Wout or whether he’ll be able to ride as a co-leader, using the other contenders’ focus on Van Aert would be ideal to slip off the front once more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The outsiders</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Look out for: Matej Mohorič, Stefan Küng, Yves Lampaert, Kasper Asgreen, Alexander Kristoff and Jasper Stuyven.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-johan-museeuw\">Johan Museeuw’s Paris-Roubaix preview: How to win the Hell of the North and 2023 predictions</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-arenberg-forest\">Where Paris-Roubaix 2023 will be decided, part 1: The Arenberg Forest</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-all-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix 2023: Routes, start lists and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>The <em>Cyclist </em>predictions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Ivan Garcia Cortina celebrates winning sprint at Gran Piemonte with thumb in mouth and hand on belly\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/ivan-garcia-cortina-gran-piemonte-2022.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>100/1, worth a go, right?</figcaption><figcaption>Gran Piemonte</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotte Kopecky is a lock. Matej Mohorič is out to win Roubaix and finished fifth in 2022 but came in with the same time as Van Aert in second. Big names watching each other will allow the Slovenian to bag a second Monument.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes on Iván García Cortina in the men’s race though, he <em>will </em>win something big soon.
