The version with a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU is actually priced starting at $2,499.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBecause there are two different 14-inch models with different ‌M1‌ Pro chips, Apple is also offering two separate power adapters. The 8-core CPU ‌M1‌ Pro MacBook Pro comes with a 67W power adapter and the 10-core model comes with a 96W power adapter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 67W power adapter is a new addition to Apple's online store and is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MKU63AM/A/67w-usb-c-power-adapter\">available for $59</a> on a standalone basis, while the 96W version was previously available and is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX0J2AM/A/96w-usb-c-power-adapter\">priced at $79</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the 16-inch MacBook Pro models, there's also a middle-tier graphics option available as an upgrade. Both the entry-level and mid-level machines can be upgraded with an ‌M1‌ Max chip with 10-core GPU and 24-core GPU that's a middle of the road option between the 16-core GPU and the 32-core GPU. Getting the 24-core GPU requires a $200 upgrade fee.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macbook-pro-14-inch-8-core-cpu/\">14-Inch MacBook Pro Starts With 8-Core CPU and Has 2 Power Adapter Options, 24-Core GPU Option Available for 16-Inch Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-inch-macbook-pro-starts-with-8-core-cpu-and-has-2-power-adapter-options-24-core-gpu-option-available-for-16-inch-model.2317616/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HLwiNIGJx-o:td_AhYP85RA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HLwiNIGJx-o:td_AhYP85RA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HLwiNIGJx-o\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a17defd7e72c5a8de2e6ea83ee989475b2c28bb4c0318193babac25c78633de9","category":"Apple"}
