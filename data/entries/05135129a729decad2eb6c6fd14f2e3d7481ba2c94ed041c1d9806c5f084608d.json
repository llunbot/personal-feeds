If you ever use your services on a Windows computer or other device, it’s a pain to dive into settings on your iPhone to find them and enter them manually. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233818/two-factor-authentication-sms-email-authenticator-app-hardware-key-accounts.html\">Two-factor authentication</a> support was limited, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Passwords app, according to Gurman, solves most of these problems. It will be available across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro, and even Windows. What’s more, it will “support verification codes and serve as an authentication app similar to Google Authenticator.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A standalone app should make it easier to manage passwords if you ever need to change one, and to access information like passwords, Wi-Fi logins, and Passkeys across multiple devices. It’s unclear what other sorts of details it may manage; password managers often contain auto-fill data for payment info and addresses, in addition to passwords. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll find out all about it in just a few days when <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC 2024 kicks off on June 10</a>.</p>\n\niOS, MacOS, Security Software and Services</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"05135129a729decad2eb6c6fd14f2e3d7481ba2c94ed041c1d9806c5f084608d","category":"Apple"}
