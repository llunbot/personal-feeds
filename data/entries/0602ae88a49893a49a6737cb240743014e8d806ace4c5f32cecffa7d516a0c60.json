Sure, that's a lot harder, but it's hard to put a price on drawing unnecessary attention to yourself while you chonk away on your faux-used future laptop.</p>\n<p>The Rasti Computer, which Chen writes is \"derived from the German compound word 'Rasterrahmen' (grid + framework),\" has at its core the mainboard, battery, and antennae from the highly modular and repairable <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/\">first-generation Framework laptop</a>. It takes input from the custom keyboard Chen designed for the chassis, with custom PCB and 3D-printed keycaps and case. It sends images to a 10.4-inch QLED 1600×720 <a href=\"https://www.waveshare.com/10.4hp-capqled.htm\">display</a>, and it all fits inside a bevy of 3D-printed pieces with some fairly standard hex-head bolts. Oh, and the hinges from a 2012 13-inch MacBook pro, though that's possibly negotiable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000774#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000774&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0602ae88a49893a49a6737cb240743014e8d806ace4c5f32cecffa7d516a0c60","category":"Tech"}
