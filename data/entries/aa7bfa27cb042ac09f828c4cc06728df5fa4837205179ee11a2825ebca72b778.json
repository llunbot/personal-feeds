The report did not mention a specific measurement, but previous rumors have indicated the device could be anywhere from 5mm to 6.25mm thin, whereas the iPhone 16 lineup starts at 7.8mm. The thinnest-ever model was the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm, so the iPhone 17 Air <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/iphone-17-air-could-be-thinnest-iphone-ever/\">would beat that record</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn line with previous rumors, the report said the iPhone 17 Air will be \"giving up\" some features available in the Pro models. For example, the report said the device will have a \"simplified\" camera system, but no other details were provided. Accordingly, the report said the device will be priced lower than the Pro lineup, which in the U.S. starts at $999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 Air in September 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also planning two foldable devices for release later, according to the report. It said one of the devices will essentially be the largest-ever MacBook with a foldable 19-inch screen, while the other is a foldable iPhone that would unfold to have an inwards-facing display that is larger than the one on the 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report said Apple is aiming to release the foldable iPhone in 2026 or 2027, while the MacBook with a foldable screen would likely debut later. Both of the devices have been rumored to be in development several times in recent years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to have faced major challenges with developing a foldable iPhone, including with the device's hinge and the protective layer that covers the screen. Apple apparently once considered a foldable iPhone with an outward-facing display, but it has settled on a large inner display, according to the report. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/\">Foldable MacBook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/\">'iPhone 17 Air' With 'Major' Design Changes and 19-Inch MacBook Detailed in New Report</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-with-major-design-changes-and-19-inch-macbook-detailed-in-new-report.2445494/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa7bfa27cb042ac09f828c4cc06728df5fa4837205179ee11a2825ebca72b778","category":"Apple"}
