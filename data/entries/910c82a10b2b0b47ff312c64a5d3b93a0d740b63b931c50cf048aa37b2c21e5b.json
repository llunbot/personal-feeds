The research indicates that machine learning using the Apple Watch's collected health data can discover trends to predict pain among people with sickle cell disease, which could provide an early warning signal and enable treatment via painkillers and saline hydration before it becomes more severe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nResearchers enrolled patients with sickle cell disease to Day Hospital for a VOC between July 2021 and September 2021 into the study, providing them with an Apple Watch Series 3 for the duration of their visit. 15,683 data points from the Apple Watch's heart rate, heart rate variability, and activity data were cross-referenced with pain scores and vital signs from the hospital's electronic medical record to create a machine learning model to predict VOCs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn another newly published <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09044.pdf\">study submitted by Colin Lea</a>, a research scientist at Apple who works on machine learning and accessibility related features, it is proposed that changes to Apple's speech recognition algorithm and machine learning could help alleviate problems for people with a stutter, significantly reducing cut-off utterances and word error rates by almost 80 percent. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/voiceover/\">VoiceOver</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-and-fitness/\">Health and Fitness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-technologies/\">Health Technologies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">Health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/voice-control/\">Voice Control</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/17/apple-watch-could-help-treat-sickle-cell-disease/\">Apple Watch Could Help Treat Sickle Cell Disease Symptoms, Study Suggests</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-could-help-treat-sickle-cell-disease-symptoms-study-suggests.2383948/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"910c82a10b2b0b47ff312c64a5d3b93a0d740b63b931c50cf048aa37b2c21e5b","category":"Apple"}
