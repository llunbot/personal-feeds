Like o1, R1 is trained to work through a simulated chain of thought process before providing an answer, which can potentially improve the accuracy or usefulness of the AI models' outputs for some types of questions posed by the user.</p>\n<p>That first part wasn't too surprising since other AI companies <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/\">like Google</a> are hot on the heels of OpenAI with their own simulated reasoning models. In addition, OpenAI itself has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">announced an upcoming SR model</a> (dubbed \"o3\") that can surpass o1 in performance.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/deepseek-spooks-american-tech-industry-as-it-tops-the-apple-app-store/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/deepseek-spooks-american-tech-industry-as-it-tops-the-apple-app-store/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc7596319a0a6dc66a078fa69802d657ec84581b98664f751614c772f61b7a00","category":"Tech"}
