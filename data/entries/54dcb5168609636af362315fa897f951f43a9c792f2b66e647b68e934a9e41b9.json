Built for the lowest possible aerodynamic drag while racing alone into the wind, the newest generation of the Plasma TT bike was ultimately developed with Team DSM to give the pro riders a pure speed advantage at race pace, while delivering improved high-speed stability, the added control of disc braking, and still maintaining flexibility within an integrated setup to accommodate individual athletes’ unique fit requirements to put the power down when they are racing against the clock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2023 Scott Plasma RC TT gen 7 time trial bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Scott Plasma RC TT, 7th generation carbon aerodynamic time-trial bike road race bike, Q36.5 team bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld-Q36-5-Tirreno-profile-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

That benchmark was a bit harder, and sent the Scott engineers back to the drawing board – and back into the wind tunnel – as they set out to redesign the Plasma platform and implement every incremental tweak they could to minimize the bike’s aero drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it seems like it worked out, as we had <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scope-aea-tt-disc-r9-t-algorithm-designed-aero-wheels-debut-at-tour-de-france-time-trial-with-dsm/\" target=\"_blank\">a sneak peek at the new bike</a> with Scope’s latest wheels last summer in the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How did they do it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott’s design team already had developed a slippery-fast <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-plasma-6-triathlon-bike-speeds-into-a-weekend-at-home-with-ironman-cancelled/\" target=\"_blank\">triathlon version of the Plasma</a> that didn’t fit within the UCI road rulebook.

The design keeps the larger 1.5″ lower bearing for tapered steerer stiffness, but allowed a smooth aero transition from the wider fork crown into a narrower headtube. Then, behind the fork crown, the downtube transitions back to a narrower airfoil shape to redirect the turbulent air spinning off the front wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Scott Plasma RC TT, 7th generation carbon aerodynamic time-trial bike road race bike, DSM racing in the rain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_photo-by-Chris-Auld_DSM-Tirreno-Adriatico-rain-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Chris Auld</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, Scott says the new Plasma RC TT reduces frame weight by 12% without any stiffness sacrifice over the previous 6th generation Plasma. And it is said to benchmark at a full 33 seconds faster over the course of a real-world 40km time trial with the same rider power output, compared to the previous bike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Right from the get-go you can sense that the Plasma RC TT is optimized for riders to give their best during time trials. It is not just the stiffness, riding stability, and aerodynamics of the frame that is great, but most definitely also the adjustability of the new cockpit: Due to the improved ergonomics that come with it, it makes a real difference, as it supports you to stay in the most aerodynamic position over time.</p>\n<cite><em>– Romain Bardet, Team DSM</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scott Plasma RC TT – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit.jpg\"><img width=\"1801\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Scott Plasma RC TT, 7th generation carbon aerodynamic time-trial bike road race bike, frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit.jpg 1801w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Scott-Plasma-RC-TT-next-gen-carbon-time-trial-bike-race-bike_frameset_frame-kit-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>2023 Scott Plasma RC TT  frameset</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 2023 Scott Plasma RC TT is offered now exclusively as a top-tier HMX carbon frameset/kit in three stock sizes (S 49, M 54 &amp; L 58cm).
