Some capabilities came in iOS 18.1, iOS 18.2, and iOS 18.3, but not the ‌Siri‌ features that Apple has been demonstrating.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple tied the new ‌Siri‌ features to the ‌iPhone 16‌ models, leading to disappointment when it became clear the updated ‌Siri‌ will not be available in the near future. Earlier this week, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-pulls-iphone-16-ad-more-personal-siri/\">removed an iPhone 16 ad</a> showing off a \"more personal ‌Siri‌,\" so it is no surprise that the website wording is being updated as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, Apple said that the more personalized ‌Siri‌ that is able to do more in and across apps is \"taking us longer than we thought to deliver,\" with the capabilities set to start rolling out \"in the coming year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple planned to release ‌Siri‌ features that include personalized context, onscreen awareness, and deeper app integration with iOS 18.4, but when the first couple of iOS 18.4 betas came out with no new ‌Siri‌ functionality, it became clear that ‌Siri‌ was not ready. There was some speculation that Apple could bring the abilities to iOS 18.5, but it's now sounding like the smarter, more capable ‌Siri‌ that's been promised won't be introduced until <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-removes-siri-personal-context-reference/\">Apple Continues Removing iOS 18 Siri Personal Context References After Delay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-removing-ios-18-siri-personal-context-references-after-delay.2452824/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1be704e0ed10ebfcdc2f59c73f3bf9a3e240ceab2b39a383beff90b14e88550e","category":"Apple"}
