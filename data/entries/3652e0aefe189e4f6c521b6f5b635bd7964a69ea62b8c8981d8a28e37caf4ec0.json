{"title":"The Talk Show Live From WWDC 2025: Tuesday June 10","link":"https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025","date":1748573400000,"content":"\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> The California Theatre, San Jose <br />\n<strong>Showtime:</strong> Tuesday, 10 June 2024, 7pm PT (Doors open 6pm) <br />\n<strong>Special Guest(s):</strong> <em>See below</em> <br />\n<strong>Price:</strong> $50</p>\n\n<p>Ever since I started doing these live shows from WWDC, I’ve kept the guest(s) secret, until showtime. I’m still doing that this year. But in recent years the guests have seemed a bit predictable: senior executives from Apple. This year I again extended my usual invitation to Apple, but, for the first time <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/06/09/ep-123\">since 2015</a>, they declined.</p>\n\n<p>I think this will make for a fascinating show, but I want to set everyone’s expectations accordingly. I’m invigorated by this. See you at the show, I hope.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/29/the-talk-show-live-tickets-2025\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3652e0aefe189e4f6c521b6f5b635bd7964a69ea62b8c8981d8a28e37caf4ec0","category":"Tech"}
