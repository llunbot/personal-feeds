Most of the exterior of the device will continue to be aluminum, except with a \"Midnight\" bluish-black finish. Today's Vision Pro is only available in silver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest images of the power cable show an anodized aluminum connector finished in Apple's distinctive Midnight color. Initial pictures of the Lightning-style connector in Midnight purportedly for the next-generation Vision device were first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/\">shared yesterday</a>:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Our next Vision <a href=\"https://t.co/VGAK9rNsrU\">pic.twitter.com/VGAK9rNsrU</a></p>— Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1911069453170999702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 12, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro uses a similar connector, except with 12 pins instead of eight, suggesting that the new cable is part of a more significant redesign, at least of the external battery. The audio strap connector appears to be the same design as that of the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Not the same size with OG lightning plug.

The latter could be the \"Vision Air\" device Kosutami has referred to.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami has a mixed track record for Apple rumors, but they were the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/\">first to say</a> that Apple would replace its leather Modern Buckle band with a FineWoven version in 2023.
