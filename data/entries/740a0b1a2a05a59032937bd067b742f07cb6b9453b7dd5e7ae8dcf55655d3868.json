The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cafc.21094/gov.uscourts.cafc.21094.19.0_1.pdf\">today accepted</a> an interim stay while the court reviews Apple's request for a full stay for the length of the appeal, effectively pausing the ban on Apple Watch imports for a brief period. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe International Trade Commission (ITC) now has until January 10 to file its response to Apple's request for a full stay while the appeal plays out.
