But for most people, the Apple Watch SE is all they need and today’s early Black Friday sale brings to a price we’ve never seen: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHXCXKPD/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 40mm Apple Watch SE in Midnight for $166.24</a> after a 20 percent coupon applied at checkout. We’ve never seen the Apple Watch SE this cheap and don’t know how long it will last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE has the same design and display as the Series 6 from 2020 but without a few key features, namely an always-on display, blood-oxygen sensor, and ECG sensor. It also has last year’s S8 chip but everything else you need is there: An optical heart-rate sensor, irregular heart rhythm notifications, fall detection, noise monitoring, always-on altimeter, sleep monitoring, 18-hour battery life, and 50M water resistance. It just got watchOS 10 as well and is sure to get several years of updates</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple won’t be updating the SE until at least next year, so go grab it at its best price ever. </p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9e09eaa37984dbe89428e5a2b982c0eb94ebfa7843baf939cf758e3ba4da62f8","category":"Apple"}
