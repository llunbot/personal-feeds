Although you do ‘clip in’ to clipless pedals, they get their name from the absence of that traditional toe-clip.</p>\n<p>While toe-clips rely on a clip and strap to hold the foot on the pedal, clipless pedals use a cleat that’s fastened to the sole of the shoe and engages with the pedal mechanically, similar to a ski binding.</p>\n<p>To clip into pedals, you step on the pedal’s face and push your foot forwards or downwards to engage the cleat. To release your foot, simply rotate it outwards.</p>\n<p>We have a guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-use-clipless-pedals/\">cycling with cleats</a> that goes into more detail on the specifics of using clipless pedals.</p>\n<p>Although most clipless pedals use similar technology, there are plenty of variations in design, construction and price.</p>\n<p>Many riders quickly come round to the benefits of clipless pedals – making the switch is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/6-road-cycling-rites-of-passage/\">rite of passage for road cyclists</a> –  but there are advantages and disadvantages to using <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/flat-or-clipless-pedals-which-is-right-for-you/\">clipless pedals vs flat pedals</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a flat pedal, we have plenty of options in our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-pedals-13-of-our-favourites/\">best mountain bike pedals</a>, which also includes our pick of the best double-sided SPD-style MTB and gravel pedals.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here you’ll find our pick of the top road pedals currently available, as well as a guide outlining what to look for when choosing clipless.</p>\n<p>This is a selection of our favourite road pedals from those we’ve reviewed on BikeRadar, but there are many more available – read about them in our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/\">pedal reviews</a> archive.</p>\n<p>We also have a list of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-bike-pedals/\">cheap bike pedals</a> if you are on a tight budget.</p>\n\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Best road bike pedals in 2021</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Look Keo Classic 3 Plus:</strong> £59 / $75 / AU$102</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano M520 SPD:</strong> £35 / $48 / AU$61</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano 105 R7000:</strong> £120 / $150 / AU$189</li>\n<li><strong>Time Xpresso 2:</strong> £50 / $65</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano PD-5800 105 SPD-SL / PD-R7000:</strong> £110 / $150 / AU$189</li>\n<li><strong>Time XPro 10:</strong> £150 / $195 / AU$199.95</li>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Speedplay Zero:</strong> £199.99 / $229.99 / €229.99</li>\n<li><strong>Look Keo 2 Max:</strong> £79.99 / $114.99 / AU$153.99</li>\n<li><strong>Look Keo 2 Max Carbon:</strong> £95 / $125 / AU$187</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano Tiagra R550:</strong> £75 / $100 / AU$99</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano Ultegra R8000:</strong> £157 / $200 / AU$249</li>\n<li><strong>Speedplay Zero Stainless:</strong> £199.99 / $214 / AU$384.99</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Look Keo Classic 3 Plus pedal</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Look Keo Classic 3 Plus is a good entry-level pedal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£59 / $75 / AU$102 as tested</li>\n<li>Easy to use and reliable</li>\n<li>Stainless steel plates for stable pedalling</li>\n<li>Reasonable weight for money</li>\n</ul><p>The Look Keo Classic 3 Plus pedals make for an ideal first clipless pedal for a cyclist, or anyone looking for an affordable pedal that has high-end tech.</p>\n<p>The pedals have a wide 60mm body that makes for stable and secure pedalling, while the stainless steel plates introduce some welcome durability.</p>\n<p>Clipping in and out of the pedals is really straightforward thanks to Look’s classic clipless pedal system.

They are reliable and a solid performer, as you would expect from a Shimano product carrying the 105 name.</p>\n<p>At this level, all Shimano SPD-SL share the same body design, so you get many of the benefits of Shimano’s higher-tier Ultegra and Dura-Ace designs.</p>\n<p>One of these benefits is the wide-body with stainless steel metal inserts. Together, these deliver a very secure and solid base for pedalling and excellent power transfer.</p>\n<p>The pedals use Shimano’s three-bolt cleat. They are available in three versions offering different levels of float, but these pedals are supplied with Shimano’s yellow cleats with 6 degrees of float.</p>\n<p>The release tension can be adjusted with an Allen key and pedals hang at a nice angle for easy clipping in.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-105-r7000-pedals-review/\">Read the full Shimano 105 R7000 pedals review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Time Xpresso 2 pedal</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Time Xpresso 2 pedals are an affordable option and feature the company’s unique composite blade technology.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£50 / $65 as tested</li>\n<li>Easy to use</li>\n<li>Large stable platform with smooth float</li>\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n</ul><p>The Xpresso 2 pedals bring Time’s unique blade design to a more affordable price point.</p>\n<p>At 315g (with cleats), the lightweight design and ease of use mean these pedals will appeal to a wide range of cyclists – especially as a first set of clipless pedals.</p>\n<p>The pedals are constructed from a steel axle with a composite body.

Otherwise, the two pedals are very similar when it comes to their clean looks, and their power functionality too.</p>\n<p>The readings from the power meters are accurate, but testing found the pedals can take a few seconds to start transmitting data. This will make little difference to the majority of cyclists but might be a concern for racers who take part in short distance races (e.g. on the track or hill climbs).</p>\n<p>The premium price tag might also be off-putting when other more affordable power meter pedals are available, but it is reflective of how the pedals are class-leaders in many ways.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/garmin-rally-rs200-power-meter-pedals-review/\">Read the full Garmin Rally RS200 power meter pedals review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2><strong>What to look for when buying clipless pedals</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Cleats</strong></h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most road cleats use a three-bolt pattern and come in a variety of different floats.</span></figcaption><span> <i>ProBikeKit</i></span></div>\n<p>Road cleats vary in design depending on the pedal, but the majority fasten to the soles of your shoes with three bolts.</p>\n<p>Look first came up with this three-point fastening and it’s become pretty much the standard for road pedals, with Shimano, Time, Mavic and others all using the same arrangement.</p>\n<p>Some brands, like Shimano, use smaller cleats that fasten with two bolts.

You can find out which would be best for you in our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">Shimano SPD and SPD-SL explainer</a></p>\n<p>Speedplay is the notable exception, with its four-bolt pattern (but then the US company effectively reverses the entire system by mounting the clip mechanism onto your shoes, leaving the pedals to act as the cleats).</p>\n<p>To use these, you’ll need four-bolt shoes or the adaptor, which is included with every set of Speedplay pedals.</p>\n<p>We have a guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-install-and-adjust-cycling-cleats/\">how to fit and adjust cycling cleats</a> if you are new to riding with clipless pedals or just need a refresh.</p>\n<h3><strong>Float</strong></h3>\n<p>Float is measured in degrees and refers to the amount your foot can move before it’s released from the pedal.</p>\n<p>It’s there to allow your feet to fall into the most natural, comfortable position while pedalling and to reduce the stress on your knees if your cleats aren’t perfectly positioned.</p>\n<p>Some cleats are ‘zero-float’, or fixed, which means they release your foot with only the slightest of movements. They need to be very carefully set up for the sake of your knees. Most cleats, however, offer something in the range of 3 to 9 degrees of float.</p>\n<p>The thing to bear in mind is the more float you have, the further you have to twist your foot in order to release it.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure about how much float you need, don’t worry, your pedal choice won’t lock you into one particular setting and you can experiment by running different cleats and adjusting the settings on your pedals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Release tension</strong></h3>\n<p>Most pedals allow you to adjust the pedals’ release tension – the amount of force required to disengage your foot from the mechanism. If you’re a beginner, start off with a low tension for easier release.</p>\n<p>This will also make it easier to clip into the pedal. As you become more confident riding with clipless pedals you can increase the tension for a more secure connection between you and your bike.</p>\n<h3><strong>Stack height</strong></h3>\n<p>This is measured from the middle of the pedal axle to the sole of the shoe. The lower the stack height the better because it places your foot closer to the axle for the best possible efficiency.</p>\n<p>You may need to adjust your saddle height if you change pedals because every model has a slightly different stack height.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ad772a0ffd153b69de45ee56e7e5341c3d0e703a93990ebd64bbc0a2708ffd0d","category":"Cycling"}
