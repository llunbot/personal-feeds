I’ve lobbied hard to get him to take me here, having read that Fóia is <i>the</i> scalp of the area, and hence it is I who planned this route, and hence this is why we elect to start in Portimão, because I read on some internet forum that this is a good place to start a ride.

It has shiny shops, little parks and a fire station that, given other scorched areas we’ve seen already, must be in constant use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the town square we find our people: cyclists. Racks of bikes sit outside the Velochique cycling cafe, dozens of Lyrca-clads in various states of repair sipping coffee, some having been up and come down, some meeting to begin their ascent.

Again this is due to more remote research, but according to a chap called Jeff Jones of Flyingeese cycle-tours, along with the climb to Alferce that we’ve just done, and the road we’ll take to Fóia, another must-do here is a trip through Death Valley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not quite sure if Death Valley is merely the M501 or perhaps the unnamed road it joins up to, and neither is Marcus. But I can at least safely surmise as our bikes hurtle downhill that we must be heading to a valley of sorts. Then, if any residual doubt remains, the road plateaus, then begins to rise steeply, which at least fits with descriptions I’ve read – one end of Death Valley is a short, steep set of hairpins.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The road plateaus after the descent from Alferce towards Monchique</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>What I’d heard less about is the off-grid mini-villages and dwellings in this area, which Marcus explains are wholly illegal but ultimately tolerated by the state. These are dilapidated campers and semi-permanent campsites in which all manner of nationalities, save for actual Portuguese, live. T</p>\n\n\n\n<p>hese are the kinds of travelling hippies Portugal is famous for, says Marcus, only a bit older and more old-school. Less the trust-fund types who’ve come to live out of a van and surf; more the part-time communists once trying to change the world. And in their own way they have, because here they are managing to live with little more than a borehole and a barbeque. Good on ’em.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A cork tree has been shaved of its cork bark.

Any sounds are muted by the foliage, our progress a wonderful mixture of tranquillity and toil. Then without any ceremony we reach the crest of the climb and the forest ejects us onto a busy road.

As we climb past the town of Marmelette, however, I am suddenly bitten by a need to be at least <i>slightly</i> efficient in our progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home at my laptop, there was a lovely left turn to be had that would neatly cut across to join the last third of the main climb to Fóia. How cunning I was to find this road; how I would wow the local riders when they saw this incredible gambit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus and I stop pedalling and sit on our top tubes and look at this secret turning, and it is immediately obvious why Garmin Connect tried to resist me using it. It is muddy, narrow and boulder-strewn, good only for tanks and donkeys. In simultaneous defeat, out come our phones to find an alternative route.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-11.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I try to hide how deflated I am, especially when we realise the only thing to do is to loop all the way back around to pretty much where we took up the start of this road in the first place. As my partner will tell you, I couldn’t Google Map my way out of a paper bag, and so it has come to pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, as it turns out the extra kilometres are really quite good and I resolve to double-down on my position that getting lost is a good thing. You discover more, and it’s why I do it. This is a shinier, newer road that weaves satisfyingly, and not un-punishingly, around what feels like one of two bands of contours. Like a warped record on a turntable we are neither truly losing or gaining height, just bobbing between these two states, spiralling round this mountain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-12.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>After getting lost, <em>Cyclist</em> finally arrives at the top of Alto do Foia, the highest peak in the Algarve</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This feeling that <i>things have turned out quite well actually</i> lasts until we are very much retracing our steps on a road previously ridden in a manner I can’t deny is somewhat soul-destroying, and one fast becoming incredibly tough on my legs.

By 1981 the country had stabilised and Quinta do Lago was returned to Jordan; it then changed hands again in the late 1980s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in 1998, Irish billionaire Denis O’Brien bought the resort, which might explain why, along with the young tennis prodigies, football teams and octogenarian padel players that can be seen around the resort’s Campus sports area, Stephen Roche, son Nico and nephew Dan Martin all come to ride here from time to time.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/big-ride-algarve-16.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>In case you didn’t realise the Velochique cafe in Monchique was for people like us</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at the Quinta do Lago Resort (<a href=\"https://www.quintadolago.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">quintadolago.com</a>), which is about a 30-minute drive from the nearest airport, Faro, and home to a wide range of accommodation, from hotels to rental villas. Quinta do Lago is also home to The Campus, which is a truly incredible sports complex comprising everything from Olympic pools to 3G pitches to The Bike Shed, where you can rent bikes, buy kit or get a service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Restaurants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Quinta do Lago is a sprawling resort that contains various restaurants, but without a shadow of a doubt Bovino Steakhouse is among the very best. It’s expensive, and yes this is a very meaty place, but food and wine was superb and the service absolutely impeccable in the non-stuffy way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Marcus Ornellas of The Bike Shed, who was a superb guide and a very patient rider – he is fast, we were slow. Thanks also to Joana Oliveira from Quinta do Lago, who hosted us at the resort, and Isabelle Thomas from Grifco PR for facilitating the trip.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/portugal-algarve-big-ride-cycling\">Lost in the Algarve: Portugal Big Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cc4267d2c4d371cbd917b28a5ccf9ee8b2c1babfdfaea73c7317a028224a3428","category":"Cycling"}
