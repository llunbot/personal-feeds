{"title":"Apple Files Emergency Motion to Pause ‘Extraordinary’ App Store Ruling on Anti-Steering Injunction","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/08/apple-appeals-app-store-ruling-epic-games/","date":1746810102000,"content":"\n<p>Tim Hardwick, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple has filed an emergency motion asking the Ninth Circuit Court\nof Appeals to pause key parts of a recent ruling that dramatically\nchanges how the App Store operates, following a contempt finding\nin its long-running legal battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgvojeggwpd/Apple%20motion%20Epic%20Games%20-%2020250507.pdf\">In court documents filed Wednesday</a>, Apple called the district\ncourt’s order “extraordinary” and argued it unlawfully forces the\ncompany to permanently give up control over “core aspects of its\nbusiness operations.”</p>\n\n<p>“A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free\naccess to its products and services, including intellectual\nproperty,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the motion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple’s argument here might go along the lines of Ben Thompson’s theory (<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-held-in-contempt-the-crux-of-the-case-the-takings-clause/\">in a subscriber-only post last Friday</a>) on <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-v/clauses/634\">the “Takings Clause” of the 5th Amendment</a>. Thompson wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My use of the word “took” is deliberate, because I am referring to\nthe Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment (the clause is\nemphasized):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise\ninfamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand\nJury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in\nthe Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public\ndanger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to\nbe twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled\nin any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\nlaw; <em>nor shall private property be taken for public use, without\njust compensation</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems to me that Judge Gonzales Rogers just did exactly that:\nher latest ruling basically says that companies like Spotify are\nentitled to iOS APIs and App Store distribution without having to\npay Apple anything.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds like a new addition to the case, it is! The Takings\nClause has not come up in any previous litigation precisely\nbecause Judge Gonzales Rogers’ original opinion acknowledged that\nApple had the right to charge a commission; the issue under the\nCalifornia Unfair Competition Law was that Apple’s commission was\nmuch higher than was justified precisely because Apple foreclosed\ncompetition. To that end, what would have made much more sense\nwould have been if Judge Gonzales Rogers lowered Apple’s proposed\n27% commission to something significantly lower; to simply wipe it\nout completely is what prompts this discussion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/09/apple-antisteering-emergency-motion\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"173575ed98e9da9055ae06462a0b2a0bfaf5caba62dd2e14ad884fb1fcb8873a","category":"Tech"}
