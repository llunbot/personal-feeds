In the app, go to Settings -&gt; Integrations -&gt; Matter, and then follow the steps to get new Matter codes for individual devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWiZ products that are updated to support Matter will also work with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings over a Wi-Fi network, rather than relying on a cloud connection, as was previously the case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUp until now, the only way to get WiZ lights to work with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> devices was by using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Shortcuts or non-officially using a workaround like HomeBridge. WiZ is owned by Signify, which also owns Philips Hue, but the latter, more expensive brand has had its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/philips-hue-delays-matter-support-update/\">Matter compatibility update delayed</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMatter is an internet of things standard that is designed to improve interoperability of smart devices between brands, so ‌‌HomeKit‌‌ devices can work with other smart home devices from Google, Amazon, and others. Matter works over Wi-Fi and Thread, with Wi-Fi allowing smart home devices to communicate with the cloud and Thread offering an energy efficient and reliable mesh network in the home.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/\">Matter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wiz/\">Wiz</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/wiz-smart-lights-apple-home-support/\">WiZ Smart Lights Now Compatible With Apple Home via Matter Update</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wiz-smart-lights-now-compatible-with-apple-home-via-matter-update.2387862/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fda401934cb1bf2d16d9f582a08642136cacbbdcb594e1c4b88b461e389374b","category":"Apple"}
