I’ve seen a little bit of Albania, and I’ve been training in Montenegro as well as Greece. I didn’t know these countries before last year and they are very beautiful places.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"christoph strasser cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_015_c_Lex_Karelly-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Karelly / lexkarelly.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultracycling might conjure up ideas of training for 12 hours a day but according to Strasser this shouldn’t be the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I train for about four to six hours a day, so it’s not as extraordinary as most people might think. The most important thing is to build up fitness over many years, and then getting used to being in the saddle for a long time, learning how to deal with sleep deprivation, managing your nutrition and hydration. A lot of these things come with experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘To increase your level of fitness, it’s not necessary to train more than six or seven hours per day. It’s about getting to know your body and your mind on long distances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I also don’t do anything else other than cycling. I’m not good at other sports like running and swimming, I just train on the bike. Sometimes I go kayaking but that’s not for training.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

sleep each night is a good way to start the race. It might seem like a lot of sleep if you want to aim for a podium finish, but you have to stay clear, focussed and not take any risks. It’s better to be fit and strong in the last days of the race so you can reduce your sleep then, rather than have very little sleep in the first half of the race.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"christoph strasser cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Mr_Unsupported_037_c_Lex_Karelly-2.jpg 1333w\" /><figcaption>Karelly / lexkarelly.com</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Strasser will be riding a Specialized Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s very durable and gives you a bit more comfort, which is important in the TCR because of the gravel sections. You need a strong bike.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You can’t plan when you will ride specific sections of the route, maybe you can for the first two days, so it’s important to have a bike which can take on gravel at any time of day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m hoping to finish the race sub-9 days. That sounds quick but the route is about 1000km shorter than last year. But then again it’s really hard to make a prediction, I know about 20% of the route and the rest will be a surprise.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Managing the heat</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"christoph strasser leaning bike against food shop\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Christoph-Strasser-tadek-ciechanowski-2-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Tadek Ciechanowski / ciechanowskiphoto.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Southern Europe is currently experiencing an intense heatwave, with temperatures hitting over 40 degrees and if it continues this is likely to massively affect the riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think it could be really big challenge not just for riding but also surviving,’ says Strasser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I really do not like the heat very much. When I did RAAM, you have to cross the desert in Southern California in the first few days and it was always super-tough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In the TCR, the really hot weather conditions will be at the end of the race, which should be better as your body will have adapted. I will carry four bottles with me this year, instead of the two I had last year.

He was road racing for 20 years and now he has changed to ultracycling. He won the Trans Pyrenees race last year, he beat me in B-Hard [another ultracycling race], he also won the Race Across the Alps and Ultracycling Dolomitica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Robin Gemperle from Switzerland was leading the race last year for the first three or four days with some others, and then he had some issues but he still came seventh. He won the Atlas Mountain Race this year and a few 24 hour races recently too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Marin de Saint-Exupéry from France was also in the top ten last year, I think it’s his fifth TCR already and he has a lot of experience. He’s still quite young so has a lot of potential to keep improving.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about Strasser himself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I need to enjoy the race, have fun, take care, and have a good ride and hopefully the result will be a good one. But above all the TCR is about the journey and the enjoyment of the challenge, not about the result.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/christoph-strasser-tcr-cyclist\">Ultracyclist Christoph Strasser talks tactics and training ahead of the Transcontinental Race</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"865aa7171c3acdcc24b3ca9036ac927411b3afc5b41fe6b8f563a12405e8237e","category":"Cycling"}
