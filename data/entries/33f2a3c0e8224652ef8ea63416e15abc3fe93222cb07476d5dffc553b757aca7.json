And there's more good news: <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830557\">A second study</a> published today in the journal offered <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm\">more data</a> that the now-annual shots are not linked to sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in young athletes—a claim that gained traction on social media and among anti-vaccine groups during the acute phase of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Together, the studies bolster current recommendations that children and teens should stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, which are estimated to have prevented <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations\">more than 3 million deaths and more than 18 million hospitalizations</a> in the first two years of their use.  So far, the recommendations for kids have largely gone unheeded; only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/child-coverage-vaccination.html\">14 percent</a> of children aged 5 to 17 are up to date on their 2024–2025 COVID shot. Surveys suggest that parents largely think the vaccines are unnecessary, given that most children only have mild COVID infections.</p>\n<p>Still, not all infections are mild, and even mild cases can lead to long COVID, according to the authors of the first study. An estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long COVID, defined as having symptoms that continue or develop four or more weeks after the initial phase of infection. With tens of millions of kids getting infected with the pandemic virus, a large number of them are at risk of developing the condition.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/covid-shots-protect-kids-from-long-covid-and-dont-cause-sudden-death/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/covid-shots-protect-kids-from-long-covid-and-dont-cause-sudden-death/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"33f2a3c0e8224652ef8ea63416e15abc3fe93222cb07476d5dffc553b757aca7","category":"Tech"}
