The Elemnt Roam 3 now includes a touchscreen, as well as updated navigation and route management functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bolt 3, meanwhile, continues its button interface. It focusses on ease of use, low weight and aerodynamics for performance riders and entry-level pricing for riders looking for their first cycling computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elemnt Roam 3 is priced at £399.99 and the Bolt 3 at £299.99 in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Wahoo is launching its first rearview radar. The Trackr Radar also includes a taillight and offers a claimed battery life of up to 20 hours. It’s priced at £179.99.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Elemnt Roam 3 has a touchscreen</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-ROAM-_-WFCC8-_3Qtr_Right-01-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roam 3 has a slightly larger display than its predecessor, up from 2.7 inches to 2.8 inches diagonal and it’s now touchscreen, rather than only button operated. Wahoo points out that the resolution is higher than the Bolt and says that the screen can be operated when wearing gloves, with pinch-to-zoom and swipe functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It inherits much of its navigation functionality from the flagship <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wahoo-elemnt-ace\">Elemnt Ace</a>, launched late in 2024, including voice prompts and detailed maps, which incorporate road types, elevation and points of interest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s the same ‘Ready to Ride’ home screen that Wahoo introduced as an update to the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-elemnt-roam-review\"> version 2 Roam</a>. Wahoo says that it has completely updated the Roam’s user interface for a modern look and added more third party app integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery life is claimed at up to 25 hours, also an upgrade from the 17 hours claimed for the Roam V2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wahoo Elemnt Roam 3 is priced at £399.99 / $449.99 / €449.99 and will be available on 6th May.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elemnt Bolt 3 gets a larger screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/ELEMNT-BOLT-_-WFCC9-_-3Qtr_Right-01-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elemnt Bolt version 3 also gets a minor screen size increase, up from 2.2 inches to 2.3 inches, although operation is still button-only. Wahoo says it’s designed for optimal readability, particularly in bright sunlight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s the same Ready to Ride home screen and enhanced connectivity to third party apps as in the Roam 3. Claimed battery life is now 20 hours, up from 15 hours for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-colour-screen-bigger-memory-better-gps-computer\">version 2

also launched its first rearview radar unit (as well as its first light), the Trackr Radar. Originally a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-varia-rtl515-rear-light-review\">Garmin invention</a>, rearview radars are now available from a few different brands, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/trek-carback-radar-tail-light\">Trek</a>, Magene and Bryton, so it’s a logical extension to Wahoo’s range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with other rearview radars, the Trackr Radar links up with a computer head unit via ANT+ or BLE to provide an alert when it detects an approaching vehicle. It’s compatible with other brands’ <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\">cycling computers</a>, not just Wahoo’s, as well as some <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-watch\">cycling watches</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to alerting the rider, the light flashes more rapidly to gain the approaching driver’s attention. A built-in accelerometer increases the brightness when the cyclist slows down, acting as a brake light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo claims battery life of up to 20 hours, thanks to a battery extender mode, which reduces light output when there are no vehicles sensed. There’s a rubber ladder-style mount to attach the unit to the bike’s seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wahoo Trackr Radar is priced at £179.99  / $199.99 / € 199.99, with the availability date to be announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-roam-3\">Wahoo updates Bolt and Roam computers and adds a rearview radar to its range</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9e496aed0867d48352ed210a041d4f819810012da1af700358c84f40eeeef228","category":"Cycling"}
