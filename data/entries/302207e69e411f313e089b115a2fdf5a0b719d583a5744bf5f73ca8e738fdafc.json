NoRain Vest has been my go-to gilet for the past decade or so and is one of the few pieces of kit in my drawer that sees almost year-round use.</span></p>\n<p>Constructed from windproof and water-repellent fabrics, it offers admirable protection from the elements.</p>\n<p>Yet, magically, the Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest fits like a glove and is packable enough to be stuffed into a jersey pocket.</p>\n<p>So unless the weather on any given ride is guaranteed to be perfect, or so cold it warrants a proper <a

Fiandre Light NoRain Vest might be the perfect gilet for road cycling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-gilets/\">cycling gilets</a> are low-tech pieces of kit.</p>\n<p>Usually made of crunchy fabrics thrown hastily together, the fit is invariably poor and they offer little protection from the elements beyond keeping the wind off your chest.</p>\n<p>They typically make up for this by being more packable than a wind- or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-jackets-for-cyclists/\">waterproof jacket</a>, but compared to sleek, aerodynamically cut <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-jerseys/\">cycling jerseys</a>, gilets often disappoint.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley wearing a Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest\" title=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The fit is excellent.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In contrast, Sportful’s Fiandre Light NoRain Vest is made from fabrics with loads of stretch and is cut slim.</p>\n<p>At 183cm tall and around 64kg, the size small fits me perfectly, with little excess fabric to flap in the wind and cause drag.</p>\n<p>As a result, it doesn’t feel you’re compromising performance for warmth when wearing it.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest front panel inside\" title=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The front panel is made from a lightweight windproof fabric.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On the Fiandre Light NoRain Vest, the front panels are made up of a slightly thicker, windproof material.</p>\n<p>Usefully, this extends up over the shoulders, so when you’re riding low in the drops your core still gets protection from the wind.</p>\n<p>The large back panel, meanwhile, is a thinner, water-resistant (or NoRain, as Sportful calls it) fabric. This is essentially a stretchy fabric with a Durable Water Resistant (DWR) coating that helps keep you dry in showery conditions.</p>\n<p>As with Sportful’s other NoRain kit (such as arm, knee and leg warmers), this treatment doesn’t mean you’ll stay bone dry in a thunderstorm. However, it can shrug off a shower and effectively has no drawbacks in terms of breathability.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest rear pockets\" title=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Sportful helpfully includes three pockets on the rear, something overlooked on many gilets.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The back also features three standard jersey pockets, which – if you’re also wearing a jersey underneath with another three – doubles your carrying capacity (I could run a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-handlebar-bags/\">handlebar bag</a>, of course, but given I care about the aerodynamics of gilets, it should come as little surprise I choose not to).</p>\n<p>This is incredibly useful for big days in the saddle, because you can stuff the extra pockets full of food or a proper waterproof jacket, if the forecast isn’t favourable.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it has a slightly dropped tail to help protect your lower back from road spray, which is very welcome when you’re not riding a bike with <a

better than a rain jersey</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest on scales\" title=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest on scales\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Despite the increased protection it affords, Sportful’s Fiandre gilet is still very lightweight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For fast road riding, I think this Sportful Fiandre gilet is the best compromise between performance and protection from the elements.</p>\n<p>Prior to getting one, I had a first-generation <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jerseys/castelli-gabba-rain-jersey-review/\">Castelli Gabba jersey</a>.</p>\n<p>Made from thicker fabrics and with half sleeves, it provides a lot more warmth and protection from the elements than a gilet, but is also cut like a racing jersey and is far more breathable than a jacket.</p>\n<p>On paper, it seems a better choice than a gilet (hence why I originally bought one), but in practice, it stays in my kit drawer except for specific circumstances.</p>\n<p>The main issue with the Gabba jersey is the extra bulk means it’s just slightly too big to stow away in a jersey pocket (my 2013 size-small Gabba jersey weighs 254g, compared to 117g for the Sportful Fiandre gilet – and, yes, I got it and a set of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/castelli-nanoflex-gear-just-in/\">Castelli Nanoflex arm warmers</a> the same year half the WorldTour peloton wore unbranded Gabbas for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Milan%E2%80%93San_Remo\">infamously snowy Milan-San Remo</a>).</p>\n<p>If the weather unexpectedly warms up mid-ride, or you need to dump more heat temporarily for whatever reason (perhaps you’re doing a long climb, for example), the only thing you can do is unzip it. You’re then left with something much less aerodynamic than you wanted.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Castelli Gabba jersey on scales\" title=\"Castelli Gabba jersey on scales\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An original Castelli Gabba jersey weighs more than double the Sportful Fiandre gilet and is considerably bulkier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Castelli has since started making a lighter Gabba jersey, called the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/2023-castelli-perfetto-gabba-ros-2/\">Perfetto RoS 2 Wind Jersey</a>, which would possibly address this issue, but at a claimed weight of 251g (for an unspecified size) it’s almost certainly still much bulkier than my Sportful Fiandre gilet.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Sportful also makes a jersey version of the Fiandre Light NoRain Vest, called the Fiandre Light NoRain Jacket Short Sleeve. With a claimed weight of 161g (again, size unspecified), this might be a better compromise.</p>\n<p>However, it almost certainly gives up some breathability by having half sleeves, likely making it less versatile on hotter days. And if it’s still too bulky to stuff in a jersey pocket, it would still have the same packability issue as the Gabba.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR Advanced Pro Disc\" title=\"SB-TCR-long-term_IMG_9898-fa4f63b\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> On changeable days, a gilet paired with arm warmers is hard to beat.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For fast days on the bike when the weather is truly foul, a rain jersey such as the Gabba can be brilliant. That 2013 Milan-San Remo was, quite literally, a perfect storm for it.</p>\n<p>However, unless I’m racing or doing a fast group ride (admittedly rare these days) – where aerodynamics and breathability are at a premium – then I’ll simply opt for a proper waterproof jacket more often than not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jackets-and-vests/jackets/rapha-pro-team-lightweight-shadow-jacket-review/\">Rapha’s Pro Team Lightweight Shadow jacket</a>, for example, provides even more protection from the elements but is still significantly lighter and more packable than a Gabba jersey.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR Advanced Pro Disc\" title=\"SB-TCR-long-term_IMG_0872-a0d5f2f\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I’ll often stuff it in my back pocket, even on days when there’s barely a cloud in the sky.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Faced with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycling-in-the-rain/\">riding in bad weather</a>, then, I typically make one of two choices.</p>\n<p>If it’s changeable or mild, I opt for the Sportful Fiandre gilet with a set of Sportful NoRain or Castelli Nanoflex arm warmers (and probably a set of knee or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/arm-and-leg-warmers/\">leg warmers</a>, too). I might also stuff a waterproof jacket in my back pocket, if the weather forecast isn’t good.</p>\n<p>If it’s pouring, I’ll wear a proper waterproof jacket from the start (or just stay in and use a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a>).</p>\n<h2>An almost decade-long love affair</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley wearing a Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest\" title=\"Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It isn’t cheap, but I definitely get my money’s worth out of the Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I purchased my first Sportful Fiandre Light NoRain Vest when it launched back in 2015.</p>\n<p>When that one eventually wore out, I simply replaced it with a new version in 2020. Nearly four years later, it’s still going strong.</p>\n<p>I could probably use a re-waterproofer to replenish the DWR coating on the rear, but I haven’t bothered yet.</p>\n<p>With an RRP of £120 / €99.90, it’s not a cheap piece of kit, but it makes up for that by providing excellent value. It makes itself useful in all but the hottest or coldest conditions, and is something I rarely head out on a road bike without.</p>\n<p>I love it so much I even bought one for my dear mum a couple of years ago, and when my current one wears out, I’ll likely just buy another.</p>\n<p>If Sportful ever stops making it, I suppose that will be when I finally give up cycling in inclement weather for good.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"302207e69e411f313e089b115a2fdf5a0b719d583a5744bf5f73ca8e738fdafc","category":"Cycling"}
