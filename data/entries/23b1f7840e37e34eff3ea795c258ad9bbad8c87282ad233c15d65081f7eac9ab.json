Only the models with 1TB and 2TB of storage have an M4 with all four high-performance CPU cores enabled.</p>\n\n<p>The 256GB and 512GB models also ship with 8GB of RAM, where the 1TB and 2TB models come with 16GB of memory installed. Though these changes are clearly spelled out on the Tech Specs page, the actual configuration page for the iPad Pros in Apple's online store doesn't give any indication that upgrading storage also upgrades your CPU and RAM.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022820#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022820&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"23b1f7840e37e34eff3ea795c258ad9bbad8c87282ad233c15d65081f7eac9ab","category":"Tech"}
