The survey only includes top sites not out of elitism, but as one part of its effort to avoid data-skewing returns from domain-parking services and spammers, which would otherwise dominate legitimate websites through sheer volume.</p>\n<p>Within that dataset, the story told is clear. Apart from PHP—which held a 72.5 percent share in 2010 and holds a 78.9 percent share as of today—only one other server-side language ever broke a 10 percent share. That one competitor is ASP.NET, which held an impressive 24.4 percent share in 2010 but was down to 9.3 percent in January and 8.3 percent this month.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794182#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794182&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9984adbb796cd2a9300007bdbb8a62ad3c098675fce07a4e40cfb031446bc65c","category":"Tech"}
