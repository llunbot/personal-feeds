For some time, racist slurs and bigoted references have been winning this fight, but a leaked interface update suggests that Twitch might finally take legitimate steps to squash its toxic chat feeds.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, streaming-industry reporter Zach Bussey shared <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1442223309198925824\">a series of screenshots</a>, including an interface as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1442223919923019780\">apparently captured from Twitch's German site</a>, that point to a new type of user verification system coming to the chat-heavy service.
