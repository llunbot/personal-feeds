Of course, if he was dead, the cabal of elites running the Biden administration, in true <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_at_Bernie%27s\"><em>Weekend at Bernie's</em></a> fashion, certainly couldn't <em>admit</em> that he was dead. Fortunately, they could use AI to make it look like Biden was still alive!</p>\n<p>That sort of thinking led to one influencer's \"just asking questions\" post on July 24, 2024, which was viewed 78,000 times: “What If [sic] during this supposed live broadcast to the nation the holographic AI glitches and Joe Biden dissappears [sic] for a few seconds now that we know the software they have been using in Azure has been compromised?”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041714#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041714&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"99370e7f3cc74415a05d26cc70edd22bfb3eee594a1b36a483454f099d7a1adb","category":"Tech"}
