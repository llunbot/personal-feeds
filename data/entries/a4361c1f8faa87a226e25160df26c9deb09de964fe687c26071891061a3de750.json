Smart HDR 4 makes photos look \"even more detailed and vivid.\"</li>\r<br />\n<li>The iPad 11 supports Bluetooth 5.3, up from Bluetooth 5.2 for the previous model.</li>\r<br />\n<li>While cellular iPad 10 models have a SIM card slot in all countries, the iPad 11 relies entirely on eSIM technology worldwide.</li>\r<br />\n<li>The iPad 11 is still compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple says the iPad 11 has an 11-inch display, while the iPad 10 is listed as having a 10.9-inch display. However, Apple is simply rounding up more with the iPad 11, as both devices actually have a 10.86-inch display.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>Apple makes no mention of the iPad 11 having its custom C1 modem, so cellular models might still have a Qualcomm modem. We await teardowns.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also unclear how much RAM is in the iPad 11, but we are working to confirm this detail as soon as possible. iPhones with the A16 Bionic chip have 6GB of RAM, but the iPad 11 has a regular A16 chip with reduced CPU and GPU specifications, so it is unclear if the iPad 11 has 6GB of RAM. The iPad 10 has 4GB of RAM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPad can be pre-ordered now, and it will launch on Friday, March 12. In the U.S., the Wi-Fi model starts at $349.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/a16-ipad-tidbits/\">Here Are 8 Things to Know About Apple's New iPad With the A16 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-8-things-to-know-about-apples-new-ipad-with-the-a16-chip.2451346/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4361c1f8faa87a226e25160df26c9deb09de964fe687c26071891061a3de750","category":"Apple"}
