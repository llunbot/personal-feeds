There are still some Macs in need of a second-generation Apple silicon update, though. Here’s what we’re still expecting to arrive: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope that a new iMac is coming soon. The iMac is still running an M1 chip while the rest of the lineup is now on the second generation of Apple’s Mac chips, and it’s well overdue an update. But will Apple skip the M2 and move straight to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">M3 for the iMac</a>? That’s the rumor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also hope to get a Pro version of the iMac, a return of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a> perhaps. It sounds like an M3 Pro iMac might happen, but we could be waiting a little longer for that one.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023</em> or spring 2024</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPads</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4315300_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one iPad that wasn’t updated in 2022, so that looks the most likely for an update. But there’s also a rumor that a larger iPad Pro could be coming. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new iPad mini – seventh generation – could be coming in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7 rumors</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bigger iPad Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro</a> coming from Apple before the end of 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhones </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival of a new set of iPhones in September 2023 is highly likely. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 camera\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 15 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 (and Plus, Pro and Pro Max) is likely to arrive, like clockwork, in September 2023. In fact the iPhone 15 Pro Max may be renamed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2023</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a long shot, but a few years ago now there were rumors that Apple could launch a bigger version of the iPhone SE Plus – which would mean that those who want a big iPhone and a Home button would still have an option. It’s a nice idea but we aren’t convinced this is in Apple’s sights now. Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674037/iphone-se-plus-postponed-until-2021.html\">iPhone SE Plus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, we can’t be sure there is a future for the iPhone SE. Apparently, an update is “unlikely” to come before 2025. If it arrives in a larger screen size and has no home button the people who are drawn to this iPhone will no doubt be disappointed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE rumors</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max are desperately in need of an update – being unable to play lossless audio right now, will they get an update in 2023? Perhaps at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple event in September</a>, although there aren’t any noisy rumors about them right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rumors about AirPods Lite, which are said to be $99 AirPods. Will these launch in 2023? Again, it’s uncertain. We may be waiting until 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023 or spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like Apple is set to launch an Apple Watch Series 9 and a second-generation Apple Watch Ultra in September 2023. Both will feature a new S9 chip, however, it doesn’t look like there will be any really big new features in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2023, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vision Pro headset </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know it’s a real thing because Apple showed off the Vision Pro mixed reality headset at WWDC in June 2023, but we are less sure when it will launch. Apple said “Early 2024”, but Apple doesn’t always meet its self-imposed deadlines.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Apple’s Vision Pro</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod with screen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?
