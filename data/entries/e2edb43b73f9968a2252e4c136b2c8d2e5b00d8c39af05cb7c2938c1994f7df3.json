Ask to Buy is not a supported feature, and universal purchase, a feature that allows apps to work across all of a user's devices, is not offered. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will not be able to offer these features because it will not be facilitating purchases of apps distributed through alternative app stores. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nScreen Time, parental controls, and Spotlight will continue to function, according to Apple, but parents will need to adjust to not having access to purchasing restrictions for apps installed outside of the ‌App Store‌. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also warns that it will not be able to assist users with refunds, purchase history, subscription management and cancelation, violations of user data privacy, abuse, or fraud and manipulations. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopers or the alternative app marketplace an app was downloaded from will need to handle issues like refunds and subscription cancelations. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> users will be able to choose not to install apps outside of the ‌App Store‌, of course, and these changes are limited to users in the European Union. \r<br />\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/features-unavailable-with-alternative-app-stores/\">Apple Warns That Some Screen Time and Sharing Features Won't Work With Alternative App Distribution in the EU</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-warns-that-some-screen-time-and-sharing-features-wont-work-with-alternative-app-distribution-in-the-eu.2417433/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e2edb43b73f9968a2252e4c136b2c8d2e5b00d8c39af05cb7c2938c1994f7df3","category":"Apple"}
