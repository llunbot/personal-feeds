Apple is said to be actively seeking new suppliers and major business partners that will help launch its autonomous vehicle.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/313622.html?gosh\">separate report</a> by <em>The Korea Times</em> cites a senior executive who said that Apple officials were in South Korea to seek \"business partners in Korea for its EV business\" and that \"without partnerships with Korean vendors, Apple won't be able to complete its EV business plan.\" The executive said talks are \"still in the early stages.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe report continues noting that Apple held \"advanced\" meetings with subsidiaries of SK Group and LG Electronics. Apple is possibly eyeing partners in South Korea thanks to its alleged plan to use lithium iron phosphate batteries in the ‌Apple Car‌, which South Korean suppliers are currently mass-producing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Apple is seeking suppliers outside of the United States, the company is also reportedly committed to ensuring that the battery used in the ‌Apple Car‌ will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-car-battery-united-states/\">produced in the United States</a>. Speculation may lead some to believe that part of Apple's goal in South Korea was an attempt to convince suppliers to build factories in the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been working on its autonomous vehicle for the past few years, but it's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/27/kuo-apple-car-2025-2027-at-earliest/\">not expected to be official until at least 2025</a>, according to Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/south-korea/\">South Korea</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-car-team-secretly-visit-south-korea/\">Apple Reportedly Sent Team of Employees to South Korea to Discuss Apple Car Development</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-sent-team-of-employees-to-south-korea-to-discuss-apple-car-development.2306964/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tiQXXtiJVag:kiZu_s_m_Q0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tiQXXtiJVag:kiZu_s_m_Q0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/tiQXXtiJVag\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a5cec5f74ee149f038acc654c25c194d7cd7acca7b71032cc91e55b0b5c03857","category":"Apple"}
