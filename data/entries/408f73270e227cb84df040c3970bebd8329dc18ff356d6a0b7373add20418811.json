White wines also contain the <a href=\"https://winefolly.com/deep-dive/sulfites-in-wine/\">same amount of sulfites as red wines</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/researchers-hone-in-on-headache-causing-compounds-in-red-wine/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/researchers-hone-in-on-headache-causing-compounds-in-red-wine/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Waterhouse and Apramita Devi, The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"408f73270e227cb84df040c3970bebd8329dc18ff356d6a0b7373add20418811","category":"Tech"}
