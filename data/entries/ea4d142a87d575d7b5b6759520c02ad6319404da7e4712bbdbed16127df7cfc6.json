Support for ‌iCloud‌ backups on devices that run iOS 8 or older has ended, and Apple has deleted all existing ‌iCloud‌ backups of those devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApps and data stored on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> running iOS 8 or earlier are not affected, and these devices can still be manually backed up to a Mac or a Windows PC. If you have a device on iOS 8 or older, if you can update, you can restore ‌iCloud‌ backup capabilities. Otherwise, all backups will need to be done manually.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that it discontinued ‌iCloud‌ backups for older devices to \"more closely align\" with its minimum software requirements. With the iOS 9 update that came out years ago, Apple adopted CloudKit for ‌iCloud‌ backups and stopped using an older system, and it looks like this older system is what's being sunset.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/icloud-backups-disabled-ios-8-or-earlier/\">iCloud Backups No Longer Available for iPhones and iPads Running iOS 8 or Earlier</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-backups-no-longer-available-for-iphones-and-ipads-running-ios-8-or-earlier.2445802/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ea4d142a87d575d7b5b6759520c02ad6319404da7e4712bbdbed16127df7cfc6","category":"Apple"}
