You can choose from GPT-3.5 or Claude Instant\nv1.1 for the model that powers your bot. We’ve found that\nsometimes a particular model is much better for a character, so\nit’s worth trying both and comparing results. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Make a fun bot? You can share it with others using a link, or make\nit public so that anyone can discover it. Make a fun character, a\ntext-based adventure game, or anything else!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve been testing this feature for a few weeks (in my previously disclosed role as an advisor to Wavelength), and it’s a lot of fun. For characters, I’ve found the Claude model, from Anthropic, to be better. Or at least more “in character”. Two fun bots I’ve made: <a href=\"https://wavelength.app/bot/FGlF1KSBEYj\">Don Rickles</a> and <a href=\"https://wavelength.app/bot/2GOIR9h4ZWs\">Triumph the Insult Comic Dog</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/rickles-gpt35-vs-claude.png\">Here’s a screenshot showing the difference</a> — same prompt/bot definition, just switching from GPT 3.5 to Claude. It’s fun to get trivia question answers <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/rickles-question-larry-brown.jpeg\">with a bit of personality</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/04/wavelength-bot-designer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"84f2d8bc7cb59d3b770d23c2d974fbd43ad6e610d1de67ee25adf26c2fbd5cb1","category":"Tech"}
