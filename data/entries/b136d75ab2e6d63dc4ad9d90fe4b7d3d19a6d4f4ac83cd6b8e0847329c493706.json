The problem is almost entirely down to our smartphones—while we know they're distracting, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/put-the-phone-down-new-studies-show-were-still-bad-at-distracted-driving/\">too many drivers</a> just can't help checking that email when they shouldn't. Now <a href=\"https://distracted-driving-simulator.quanata.com/#home\">a new online tool</a> provides an easy way to grasp just how much of the road we can miss while playing with that phone.</p>\n<p>The distracted driving tool was developed by Quanta, a \"context-based insurance provider,\" which wants to raise awareness of the problem. \"Quanata’s technology aims to create a future where risk-informed choices enable safer drivers and better lives. We recognize that a lot of the danger on our roads is caused by distracted driving and we want to help minimize that,\" said Jim Ryan, SVP of business development at Quanta.</p>\n<p>The tests include preparing a text message while your car drives at 70 mph and then a comparison of reaction times at 70 mph when concentrating on the task of driving versus trying to assemble an order in a fast food app.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/distracted-driving-simulator-shows-why-you-shouldnt-text-on-the-highway/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/distracted-driving-simulator-shows-why-you-shouldnt-text-on-the-highway/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
