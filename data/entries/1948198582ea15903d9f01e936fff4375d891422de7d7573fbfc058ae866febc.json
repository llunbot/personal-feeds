These exploits are able to override an industry-standard defense known as Secure Boot and execute malicious firmware early in the boot process. Until now, there were no public indications that LogoFAIL exploits were circulating in the wild.</p>\n<p>The discovery of code downloaded from an Internet-connected web server changes all that. While there are no indications the public exploit is actively being used, it is reliable and polished enough to be production-ready and could pose a threat in the real world in the coming weeks or months. Both the LogoFAIL vulnerabilities and the exploit found on-line were discovered by Binarly, a firm that helps customers identify and secure vulnerable firmware.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/code-found-online-exploits-logofail-to-install-bootkitty-linux-backdoor/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/code-found-online-exploits-logofail-to-install-bootkitty-linux-backdoor/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1948198582ea15903d9f01e936fff4375d891422de7d7573fbfc058ae866febc","category":"Tech"}
