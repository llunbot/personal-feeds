Apple last updated the machine at WWDC last June with the M2 chip and support for high-impedance headphones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA previous report indicated that the next 13-inch MacBook Pro will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/new-macbook-airs-with-m3-chip-report/\">powered by Apple's M3 chip</a>, which the company has yet to announce. It's unclear when the laptop would launch, but a release later this year is likely at this point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/14/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-like-chip-logs/\">working on a larger 15-inch MacBook Air</a> with a processor equivalent to the M2 chip, an updated 13-inch MacBook Air, a new 24-inch iMac, and a Mac Pro tower powered by Apple silicon. Last, he expects updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips to be released in the first half of 2024.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/14/updated-13-inch-macbook-pro-gurman/\">13-Inch MacBook Pro Said to Remain in Apple's Lineup With New Model Planned</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/13-inch-macbook-pro-said-to-remain-in-apples-lineup-with-new-model-planned.2386837/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ae63a287a4009209dbd793c0446894e7c9c502e9c07163eec64709bda8b8413","category":"Apple"}
