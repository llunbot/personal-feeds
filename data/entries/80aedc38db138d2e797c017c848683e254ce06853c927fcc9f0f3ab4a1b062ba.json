{"title":"Steep Discounts on M3 MacBook Air Models at Amazon","link":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHQGGN5?tag=df-amzn-20","date":1733162599000,"content":"\n<p>Amazon is running a holiday discount on M3 MacBook Airs, but it’s tricky — you need to click around through various color choices and watch the prices and ship dates. My main link on this post goes to the config that looks like their best deal for price-conscious gift buyers: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHQGGN5?tag=df-amzn-20\">the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air in space gray, with 24 GB RAM and 512 GB of storage for $1,299</a>, a $200 discount from the list price, with delivery in a few days. They’ve also got the same configuration, at the same price, with the same delivery window in silver. Starlight only has “5 remaining in stock” (and that was at 8 just a few minutes ago, so they’ll likely be gone by the time you read this), and midnight is already out of stock.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX246FNZ?tag=df-amzn-20\">13-inch configuration with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB storage is just $1,099</a>, but delivery dates are in early January. They’ve got <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3?tag=df-amzn-20\">the configuration with 16 GB RAM and 256 GB storage for just $899</a>, but only in midnight and starlight, and with delivery windows of “1 to 2 months”.</p>\n\n<p>The best option for 15-inch M3 MacBook Airs is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHN9WYG?tag=df-amzn-20\">the configuration with 24 GB RAM and 512 GB storage for $1,424</a> — a $275 discount from the regular price of $1,699. That’s available at that price, with next-week delivery, in all four colors. They’ve also got $200 discounts on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLJ4J78G?tag=df-amzn-20\">various</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX24BN3L?tag=df-amzn-20\">configurations</a> with 16 GB RAM, but delivery on those models is out in January.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, all of these links are using my make-me-rich affiliate code. And Amazon <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4fRPvJR\">still has USB-C AirPods Pro 2 for just $154</a>, almost $100 off the regular price.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/02/steep-discounts-on-m3-macbook-air-models-at-amazon\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"80aedc38db138d2e797c017c848683e254ce06853c927fcc9f0f3ab4a1b062ba","category":"Tech"}
