In response, Zuckerberg said that the Quest \"is better\" than the Vision Pro now, and that if the Meta Quest has the \"motion blur,\" weight, or \"lack of precision inputs\" as the Vision Pro in the future, then Meta will have \"regressed significantly.\"\r<br />\n<blockquote>I don't think we're saying the devices are the same. We're saying Quest is better. If our devices weigh as much as theirs in 3-5 years, or have the motion blur theirs has, or the lack of precision inputs, etc, then that means we'll have regressed significantly. Yes, their resolution is higher, but they paid for that with many other product tradeoffs that make their device worse in most ways. That's not what we aspire to.</blockquote>\r<br />\nZuckerberg also took offense to the Meta Quest being called \"a games device,\" and clarified that some of the top apps on the Quest are social, browser, and video player apps.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Actually, 3 of the top 7 Quest apps are already social apps - Horizon, VR Chat, and Rec Room. Browser and video player are top apps too. Fitness isn't as high up there, but has a passionate community as well. So I think the narrative that these headsets are only for games is out of date. And yes, more resolution is better - but trading off ergonomics and motion blur isn't a clear win when Quest's resolution is also quite good.</blockquote>\r<br />\nDevice weight and \"motion blur\" have been two points that Zuckerberg has focused on in his criticism of the Vision Pro, and he has dismissed the higher resolution of Apple's headset as unnecessary given the \"tradeoffs\" that he sees.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nZuckerberg in February said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/\">the Quest 3 is superior</a> because it is 7x less expensive than the Vision Pro, it's more comfortable, the Quest is \"crisper,\" there are \"precision controllers,\" and there's a \"deeper\" immersive content library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>'s 4K microLED displays, the Quest 3 has two 2K LCD panels. It also weighs in at 515 grams, while the Vision Pro weighs 600 to 650 grams depending on the Light Seal combination used, and the Quest does not have a separate battery pack.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg-comments/\">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Again Disparages Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-again-disparages-apple-vision-pro.2421672/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5ee5c2036d432920a1ac9efd6f35f02c5d10723e6ec76cf9acc7fbedbbc1c62c","category":"Apple"}
