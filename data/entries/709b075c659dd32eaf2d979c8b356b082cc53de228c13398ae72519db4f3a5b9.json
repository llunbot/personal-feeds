The Spectator has published the entire transcript, and I read it so you don’t have to, to get the part about Apple and the UK’s encryption backdoor demand:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>BD: But the problem is he runs, your vice president obviously\neloquently pointed this out in Munich, he runs a nation now\nthat is removing the security helmets on Apple phones so that\nthey can —</p>\n\n<p>DJT: We told them you can’t do this.</p>\n\n<p>BD: Yeah, Tulsi, I saw —</p>\n\n<p>DJT: We actually told him… that’s incredible. That’s something,\nyou know, that you hear about with China.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It feels quite odd to strongly agree with Trump on something, but he’s not wrong about everything.</p>\n\n<p>(Most of the interview is just bananas stuff, ping-ponging all over the place.
