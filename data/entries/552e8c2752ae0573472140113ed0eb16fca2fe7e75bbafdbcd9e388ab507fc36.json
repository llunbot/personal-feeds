{"title":"Jim Acosta, Reporter and Anchor Despised by Trump, Leaves CNN","link":"https://www.threads.net/@oliverdarcy/post/DFYAusVCnzL","date":1738090336000,"content":"\n<p>Jim Acosta, signing off from CNN for the final time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant. I believe it is\nthe job of the press to hold power to account — I’ve always tried\nto do that here at CNN, and I plan on doing all of that again in\nthe future.</p>\n\n<p>One final message: Don’t give in to the lies. Don’t give in to the\nfear. Hold on to the truth, and hope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>President Trump, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113906705175756002\">gloating</a> on his very popular social network, Truth Social (current ranking the App Store: not in the top 200 free downloads, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/truth-social-app-store-2025-01-28.png\">#20 in Social Networking</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wow, really good news! Jim Acosta, one of the worst and most\ndishonest reporters in journalistic history, a major sleazebag,\nhas been relegated by CNN Fake News to the Midnight hour, “Death\nValley,” because of extraordinarily BAD RATINGS (and no talent!).\nWord is that he wants to QUIT, and that would be even better. Jim\nis a major loser who will fail no matter where he ends up. Good\nluck Jim!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@aaron.rupar/post/DFIpGsKgXdb\">Here’s a recent example of Acosta’s exemplary work on CNN</a>, interviewing Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ACOSTA: Do you agree with Trump’s decision to pardon violent\npeople?</p>\n\n<p>REP. BURCHETT: If they were truly violent, no. But I don’t\nknow that?</p>\n\n<p>ACOSTA: What do you mean you don’t know? We’re showing the footage\nright now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oliver Darcy, the former CNN media reporter now at under his own umbrella at Status, has been all over the abject cowardice of CNN’s current chief executive, Mark Thompson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The anchor, I’m told, signaled to associates in private\nconversations over the weekend that he intends to depart the\nnetwork after its chief executive, Mark Thompson, booted him from\nthe morning programming lineup — a move that conspicuously\ncoincided with Donald Trump’s return to power.</p>\n\n<p>CNN brass, <a href=\"https://www.status.news/p/jim-acosta-cnn-mark-thompson-midnight-offer\">as we first reported earlier this month</a>, decided\nto strip Acosta of his 10am show, which he has anchored to great\nratings success over the last 11 months, at times even seeing\nhigher viewership than programs in the channel’s prime time bloc.</p>\n\n<p>Acosta was instead offered the less-than-desirable option of\nanchoring a show from midnight until 2am ET.</p>\n\n<p>CNN pitched the gig to Acosta as anchoring during prime time on\nthe West Coast and said he could move to Los Angeles to host the\nprogram. But the reality is the program would have aired at a time\nin which cable news viewership is at its lowest levels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Acosta’s morning ratings were high, not low. There’s no explanation for CNN forcing him to midnight other than appeasement of a president who spends his days obsessing over cable news.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/acosta-out-at-cnn\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"552e8c2752ae0573472140113ed0eb16fca2fe7e75bbafdbcd9e388ab507fc36","category":"Tech"}
