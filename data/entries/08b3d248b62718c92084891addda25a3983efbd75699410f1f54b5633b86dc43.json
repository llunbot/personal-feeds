Its platform offers user-friendly design tools aimed at non-professionals and has a user base of over 175 million people worldwide. The acquisition of the Affinity apps marks a change of strategy for Canva, targeting professional designers and creatives who have traditionally relied on Adobe's suite of products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAffinity's software, encompassing photo editing, vector illustration, and desktop publishing tools, has been been lauded for its performance, affordability, and one-time purchase model â€“ a stark contrast to Adobe's subscription services. The apps have garnered a strong following among Mac users in particular.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe acquisition includes the transition of Serif's 90-person team to Canva, ensuring continuity in the development and support of Affinity apps. Cliff Obrecht, Canva's co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, emphasized that Affinity's portfolio is the \"final piece in our jigsaw,\" indicating how the apps are expected to complement Canva's existing array of AI-powered design solutions and collaborative online workspaces.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-photo/\">Affinity Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-designer/\">Affinity Designer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-publisher/\">Affinity Publisher</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/canva-acquires-affinity-apps/\">Canva Acquires Serif's Affinity Apps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/canva-acquires-serifs-affinity-apps.2422854/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"08b3d248b62718c92084891addda25a3983efbd75699410f1f54b5633b86dc43","category":"Apple"}
