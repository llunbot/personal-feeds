The core Brompton folder concept is still there – this thing still does origami magic to pack down barely bigger than its wheels. But scaled up to a more standard 20″ wheelsize and up to 2.1″ wide tires, the Brompton G Line is a much bigger bike than every 16″-wheeled Brommie before it. And it promises to ride much more like a full-sized bike than any past folding bike…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brompton G Line: folding adventure gravel bike on 20″ wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Brompton is calling their G Line folding gravel bike the “most versatile bike in the world”. That obviously sounds a bit extreme, but there’s something to be said for the G Line. Brommie folders are already quite versatile in that they are simple to take with you places a normal bike just can’t easily reach – like in trains, buses, the trunk of a taxi or friend’s car, under your desk at work, or any other tight spaces. And gravel bikes are also so hot these days because of their versatility. Ride them on smooth tarmac, underdeveloped dirt &amp; gravel roads, or often even on stretches of trail that we’d only have thought to ride on a mountain bike just a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, combine a folder and a gravel bike, and this is unquestionably the most versatile Brompton ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Now, as more and more people look to escape the city, exploring roads and trails less traveled, it was the right time to take everything that makes the Brompton so special, and make it capable of going beyond the urban environment and into tougher terrain.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Will Butler-Adams, Brompton CEO</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brompton G Line folding adventure gravel bike riding with 20&quot; wheels and 2.1&quot; tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Brompton)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the G Line suitable for gravel riding, Brompton had to bump up the wheel diameter from their traditional (but obscure) 16” to a bigger and more common 20”. With that you also get much wider tubeless-ready 2.1” Schwalbe G-One gravel tires to take on rough terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do you get improved rollover (think going from 26” to 29” wheels) and larger tire volume (54mm vs. the 35mm of the standard C or T Lines), you also get a longer wheelbase too. The signature Brompton folding mechanism – 1st in the middle of the toptube and 2nd just behind the bottom bracket – means the wheel size pretty much determines wheelbase length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And combining the longer wheelbase and larger wheels, that means that the Brompton G Line folding gravel bike is said to simply ride much more like a full-sized bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also happens to be the first Brompton folding bike to get disc brakes. Bigger wheels, bigger adventures, and better hydraulic stopping power to keep you in control over any riding surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_folded-in-the-mountains-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_folded-in-the-mountains-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brompton G Line folding adventure gravel bike 20&quot; wheels, folded in nature\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_folded-in-the-mountains-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_folded-in-the-mountains-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_folded-in-the-mountains-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_folded-in-the-mountains-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_folded-in-the-mountains-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Brompton G Line gravel bike still executes that signature Brompton fold in just 20 seconds. It packs down to just 69(h) x 73(l) x 40cm (w) when folded to fit into tight spaces (<em>size Small</em>). The lightest regular G Line build has a claimed weight of just 13.9kg/30.6lb (<em>Small</em>) or 14.8kg/32.6lb with rack &amp; fenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ebike version Brompton Electric G Line with complete rack and fenders weighs a claimed 19.5kg/43.0lb, including the 3.4kg/7.5lb battery with its quick-release bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Brommie in 3 sizes, too!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to big wheels, this G Line Brompton gravel bike also comes in 3 different sizes. Essentially due to the fact that this is more of a performance-oriented bike where fit is more crucial than a classic commuter, the new G Line introduces 3 folding bike sizes – S, M &amp; L. We are still talking just contact points, though – they all share the same folding frame. So the three sizes dictate the rise and offset of the extended stem and seatpost length range, effectively varying handlebar Stack and saddle-to-bar Reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brompton G Line gravel folder – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brompton G Line folding adventure gravel bike 20&quot; wheels, in the subway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_commuter-folded-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This all-new 20″ gravel Brompton <a href=\"https://www.brompton.com/g-line\" target=\"_blank\">G Line</a> folding gravel bike is officially available two weeks from now in October 2024.
