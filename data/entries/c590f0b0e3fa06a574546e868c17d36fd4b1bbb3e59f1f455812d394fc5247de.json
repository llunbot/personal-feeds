Stop riding, or cruise along a smooth section of trail, and the light dims slowly so your eyes can adjust.</p>\n<p>Wiggle the bar or hit a bump and it switches to full power instantly. This works so well it renders manual modes pointless, so you can have an entirely hands-off experience.</p>\n<p>There’s more than enough power to light up the most technical trails and it’s evenly spread with a gradual fade that provides incredible context. Plenty of light is projected downwards which also has beautiful hue.</p>\n<p>In 2,700-lumen Reflex++ mode, run time is a generous three hours. The aluminium unit is IP65-rated and has a two-year warranty; the LEDs are guaranteed for life.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/lights/front-light/exposure-maxx-d-mk15-front-light-review/\">Read our full Exposure MaXx-D MK15 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Magicshine Monteer 8000S Galaxy V2.0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy direct</strong> from <a href=\"https://magicshine.com/collections/best-mountain-bike-lights/products/monteer-8000-mountain-bike-lights\" target=\"_blank\">Magicshine</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Magicshine Monteer 8000S Galaxy V2.0 Remote mountain bike front light\" title=\"Magicshine Monteer 8000S Galaxy V2.0 Remote - 08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Magicshine’s Monteer 8000S Galaxy V2.0 Remote mountain bike front light scores full marks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £340 / $410 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Claimed max output:</strong> 8,000 lumens</li>\n<li><strong>Run time (max power):</strong> 1 hour 38 minutes</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Immense power for technical trail riding</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Run time; battery and mode indicators would be a great bonus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Boasting a brain-bending 8,000 lumens, the Galaxy’s immense brightness is second to none.

The remote makes changing modes simple, although its two buttons aren’t illuminated.</p>\n<p>With the optics swapped out, there was a good spread of light to help pick out turns and a good throw of light down the trail with plenty of illumination, so you shouldn’t need a second light source.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/lights/front-light/gloworm-xs-adventure-lightset-2-0-review/\">Read our full Gloworm XS Adventure Lightset (2.0) review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Lupine Alpha</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lupine Alpha mountain bike front light\" title=\"Lupine Alpha - 07\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Alpha is seriously powerful.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Price:</b> €1,080 as tested</li>\n<li><b>Claimed max output:</b> 7,200 lumens</li>\n<li><b>Run time (max power): </b>1 hour 20 mins</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> High power output</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Mount stability; cost</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although its power comes at a price, the Lupine Alpha seriously impressed.

The optics create a fantastic mix of flood and spot lighting, and side-to-side lighting is also great. The only drawback from its lack of pure horsepower is that the range isn’t amazing, but this is only a real problem when you’re going at top speed on fast fireroad descents.</p>\n<p>Battery life is impressive and although the mode and battery indicators are a bit vague it’s an easy-to-use unit overall.

This makes it suitable for riding pretty much all trail centre-type routes and gentler singletrack too.</p>\n<p>The beam pattern gives a bright and fairly round focal point, and some side and front flood tapering that helps generate context on the trail. However, the reach of the light is lacking a little.</p>\n<p>Included in the box is a helmet mount, and we think the X-Power works best as a lid light. It has four steady and two flashing modes, plus an SOS mode.</p>\n<p>The 5,200mAh battery pack is quite long at 17cm, so can be tricky to mount on bikes with curvy tubes.

You can get away with less, but if you ride fast or on technical trails more lumens is better than less.</p>\n<p>Run time can vary a great deal between lights and it is minimised the more power the LEDs are pumping out. We’ve listed the run time for each of the lights in this list at max power.</p>\n<p>Beam pattern refers to how the lights disperse light across the trail, and it can be just as important as lumens when it comes to how well you can see.</p>\n<p>Lights will often have either a spot or flood pattern. Spot patterns highlight details in front of you in great detail. Flood patterns disperse the light over a wider area and can give you a better sense of what’s around you. Some lights use a mixture of both.</p>\n<p>Do you need an extra-long cable for a battery pack? Are you looking to mount a light on multiple bikes It’s worth paying attention to the extras that come with a light to make sure it is suitable for your specific needs.</p>\n<p>We’ve made sure to refer to these four points in the reviews of all the lights listed here.</p>\n<h3>Lumens</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"MTB Batteries Lumenator 20 mountain bike front light beam shot\" title=\"MTB Batteries Lumenator 20\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lumens aren’t the only measure that makes for a good mountain bike light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton</i></span></div>\n<p>We set a lower limit of 1,500 claimed lumens when testing mountain bike lights, which is more than ample to provide safe and well-lit shredding. You could get away with less, but how suitable that is will depend entirely on how fast you want to go and how technical the trails are.</p>\n<p>In the same way that claimed battery life, weight and a host of other things vary from their real-life measures, the number of lumens a manufacturer claims their light has, compared to how many it actually has, can vary significantly.</p>\n<p>Don’t fret, though. While claimed lumens is relatively important, what really matters is how that light is projected, not necessarily how bright it is.</p>\n<h3>Run times</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Exposure Diablo MK14 mountain bike front light\" title=\"Exposure Diablo MK14 mountain bike front light-5\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s good to remember your battery life so you don’t get caught in the spook-zone.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The same goes for run times. In our tests, we timed each of the lights on their max setting to find out just how long the juice will last.</p>\n<p>Obviously, if the LEDs push out lots of light, more battery power is required. All of our lights have at least one-hour of run time at the 1,500-lumen minimum requirement, but most offer considerably more burn time at their max output, so it’s unlikely you’ll get caught short.</p>\n<p>Battery and LED tech is improving all the time, and although lights with dedicated, separate battery packs will last longer than combined all-in-one units, the gap between the two is narrowing.</p>\n<h3>Beam pattern</h3>\n<p>Light output isn’t the only factor to consider, beam patterns are just as important. Some lights project their output into one specific area, illuminating everything within that space with exceptional detail, but that’s frequently at the expense of broader coverage.</p>\n<p>Lights that flood their output illuminate more of the trail’s surroundings, giving a better sense of where you are and highlight details easily missed with a more focused beam. This wider beam spread means it’s easier to see around turns, too – something that needs to be considered if you’re not running a dual-bar and lid-mounted setup.</p>\n<p>Lights with multiple lenses or beam reflectors can combine spot and flood outputs, with the further option to toggle between them.

Although it’s possible to spend even more or a bit less, with a 1,500-lumen lower limit this is the sort of price bracket you’re looking at unless you’re considering buying an eBay special.</p>\n<h3>Battery pack</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lupine SL MiniMax AF front light for mountain bikers\" title=\"Lupine SL MiniMax AF - 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Battery packs are usually strapped to frames.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On more powerful or longer-lasting lights, the battery pack is frequently separate from the LED section. They’re connected using a cable and the battery can be mounted to your frame or stem with Velcro straps or similar.</p>\n<h3>Bar mount</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lumicycle Explorer 2 Enduro Pack front light for mountain bikers\" title=\"Lumicycle Explorer 2 Enduro Pack - 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mounts vary, with some being separate and others being apart of the light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>All of our lights on test are bar-mounted. Usually, the mount is tightened to the bars using an Allen key because head units can be quite heavy. Some lighter options use a rubber O-ring, while other systems have a bespoke ratchet strap system.</p>\n<h3>Lens</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lupine SL MiniMax AF front light for mountain bikers\" title=\"Lupine SL MiniMax AF - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The beam pattern is affected by lens type.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As the light from the LED and reflector shines through the lens it’s either focused or spread depending on the characteristics of the lens. Lights with multiple lenses will give a greater range of beam patterns, illuminating the trail more.</p>\n<h3>Waterproof rating</h3>\n<p>It’s a fact, electronics and water aren’t best friends. While most light manufacturers have worked hard to avoid short circuits by waterproofing their lights, some have gone the extra mile and have been awarded an official IPXX (International Protection) rating.</p>\n<p>The first number ranges from 0 to 6 (0 lowest, 6 highest) and denotes how dust-proof it is, the second is the waterproof rating ranging from 0 to 9 (0 lowest, 9 highest). If you’re being picky and are worried about the sorts of conditions you’re going to be riding in, pick a light with the highest rating. It is possible to have a dust rating and no waterproof rating and vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<p>With great power comes more weight. Generally speaking, if your light is putting out enough lumens to cast shadows during the day then it’s going to require more power to generate that brightness and last for any significant amount of time. Bigger lithium-ion batteries are heavier and if the light is bar-mounted then this is something you’ll need to consider.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c590f0b0e3fa06a574546e868c17d36fd4b1bbb3e59f1f455812d394fc5247de","category":"Cycling"}
