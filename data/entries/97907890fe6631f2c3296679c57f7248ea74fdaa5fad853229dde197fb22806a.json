Now many communities are attempting to dig out from the catastrophic damage throughout western North Carolina and the Appalachian Mountains. There has been mass destruction. Entire towns have vanished. Homes and lives have been lost and people are getting by without electricity, food, and water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surrounding mountains of Western North Carolina are one of the main reasons so many iconic bike brands have made it their home. To save that home, the entire community is banding together to rebuild – but they could use all the help they can get. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, most of everyone that we’ve reached out to have reported that their teams are safe, and some, like Industry Nine, even have power. As a result, those brands have put their bike business aside to focus on aiding the community, and some are offering products where the proceeds will go towards relief efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a

Given that I9’s headquarters now have power, instead of building and shipping hubs and wheels, they have been using their building as a donation collection and distribution center. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry Nine Vice President, Jacob Mcgahey, tells us that “we have power back and we are organizing members of our staff for food deliveries to those in need as well as sending out a big chainsaw crew to help clear some of the roads in areas where folks are still trapped and cut off from resources.  We are also clearing and organizing our loading dock area to serve as a drop-off and redistribution center for a relief effort put together by another local company that is providing food and supplies to send out to the community. We have also been purchasing and collecting donations for food, water, diapers, generators etc., and delivering them to areas that need them. I’m really proud of how our crew is handling this, but all of the collective actions by the community, utilities, etc. are a drop in the bucket for what will be needed to address the impacts of Helene.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From Industry Nine:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friends, Customers, Bike Community,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, thank you to everyone who has reached out since Helene devastated Western North Carolina. As of today, all Industry Nine employees have been accounted for but we are still waiting to hear from a few of our Turnamics staff (Industry Nine’s Machine Shop). Needless to say, our efforts have been focused on the safety our of families, team and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our leadership team has finally been able to connect and recovery/rep efforts are only beginning to shape. At minimum, we will be closed for the rest of this week, as we are still without water and other basic needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you waiting on your order or repair status, we ask and value your patience while we work though this disaster in our community. While our team is currently focused on helping each other and our community, we can’t wait to get back to work and catch up on communication and order fulfillment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On behalf of our entire crew, we appreciate and value all of you. Thanks again to everyone who has reached out. We feel your love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CaneCreekCyclingComponents\" target=\"_blank\">Cane Creek</a> Cycling Components</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although their offices are temporarily closed, and systems are down, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CaneCreekCyclingComponents\" target=\"_blank\">Cane Creek’s Facebook page</a> has some info on it as well. They point out that local officials are still urging people not to self-deploy into affected areas, and to call 2-1-1 if you’re local to connect with local resources, reunification services, food banks, and other support centers. They have also put together a list of what to donate and where to donate or find assistance <a href=\"https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/news/how-to-help-those-affected-by-hurricane-helene/?amp&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawFrlR9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHZlU1wgyGYxwUmd0wsrXKQc4-yWOogSJThSLjGRZj3JwFevV6de7caXnmQ_aem_e2qlFn--GKBUmIUNRrWliw\" target=\"_blank\">hit right here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pisgah Area SORBA</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1104\" height=\"737\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-jpeg.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-jpeg.webp 1104w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pisgah-Area-SORBA-Revel-bike-giveaway-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, all of the USFS trails are closed, and all Pisgah Area SORBA events are canceled until further notice. Obviously, the priority is on the recovery efforts of the surrounding communities, while the trails will have to wait. Unfortunately, when that time comes, it’s almost guaranteed that a huge amount of work will be required to reopen the MTB mecca that is the greater Asheville area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the hurricane was even expected, Pisgah Area SORBA had teamed up with Earth Mountain Bicycle, Fox Factory, SRAM, Industry Nine, Cane Creek, WTB, Race Face, Crankbrothers, Bivo, and the MTB Skills Factory to offer this incredible custom Revel Rail 29 (large frame only) along with two hours of tailored lessons from the MTB Skills Factory to one lucky winner – worth around $13,000! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are assuming the giveaway is still going to end on Oct. 14th as scheduled with the drawing on the 18th, and have reached out to confirm. Many people are still struggling just to communicate with loved ones, so be patient here. Entries start at 10 for $10, with increasing numbers as the dollar amount increases (200 for $100, etc.). You can also make a general donation. Pisgah Area SORBA set a $30k goal for the fundraiser which initially was set to benefit trails in the Pisgah Ranger District. It’s currently not even halfway there, so<a href=\"https://pisgah.rallyup.com/revelyourride/Campaign/Details?utm_campaign=win_a_custom_mountain_bike_support_pisgah_trails_enter_now&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=2024-09-01/\"> let’s help them get over the top</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Seth’s Take (2 days ago)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we’ll leave you with one of the latest videos from Berm Peak where Seth is hosting a fundraiser of his own, with proceeds going to the American Red Cross. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Know of other ways to help?
