The brand has also announced three new wheelsets, two for road use and one for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/bikes/gravel-adventure-and-cyclocross\" target=\"_blank\">gravel</a>, which use its two-speed Powershift hub to eliminate the need for a double crankset and front derailleur, while still providing a similar gear range. The always-engaged planetary gearing in the Powershift hub also avoids the risk that a front derailleur system has of dropping a chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand says that the new wheels are as much as 12 percent lighter than its previous wheels, as well as offering a 14 percent improvement in aerodynamics and a 10 percent increase in stiffness. The road wheels are available in 36mm and 50mm depth, the gravel wheels are 42mm deep. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hunt-classified-powershift-wheels\">Hub gears for gravel?

The team will ride on the gravel race circuit, including the UCI Gravel World Series and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gravel-world-championships-2023-gallery-tech\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel World Championships</a>, which this year will take place in October in Leuven in Belgium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classified has a star-studded list of ex-pro investors led by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/i-suffered-less-at-roubaix-than-flanders-tom-boonen-in-retirement\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Boonen</a> and including Philippe Gilbert, Andre Greipel, Marcel Kittel and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no14-anna-van-der-breggen\" target=\"_blank\">Anna van der Breggen</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its hubs have garnered plenty of attention and are available on wheels from a number of third party wheel vendors, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hunt-classified-powershift-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">Hunt </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/parcours-classified-powershift-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">Parcours </a>in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, along with the new Classified wheelsets, helps address one of our few criticisms of the Classified Powershift hub when we reviewed it in June 2022, namely the small number of compatible wheels then available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New R36 wheelset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-970x644.jpg\" alt=\"Classified R35 wheelset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-970x644.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-1140x757.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/20240115-Classified-Webres-MatsPalinckx-38.jpg 1612w\" /><figcaption>Classified</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is the R36 wheelset, with a claimed weight of 1,315g, excluding the rear hub.

Classified claims a 1,350g wheelset weight, again without the Powershift rear hub. A 410g rim with asymmetric profile is designed to increase stiffness and Classified claims that the G42 is one of the most aero gravel wheelsets available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The G42 rim’s internal width is 25mm and recommended tyre width is between 30mm and 55mm, with tyre pressure up to 80psi/5.5 bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/classified-powershift-hub-review\" target=\"_blank\"> Classified Powershift hub review</a> for more on Classified’s front mech killer.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/classified-sponsors-gravel-team-and-launches-three-new-wheelsets\">Classified sponsors gravel team and launches three new wheelsets</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a32942e9ad2f53165fcf711612b2cf06d6dac0225f55557aa8183d2030a46fbb","category":"Cycling"}
