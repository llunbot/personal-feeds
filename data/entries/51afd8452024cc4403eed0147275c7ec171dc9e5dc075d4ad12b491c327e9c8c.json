These MacBooks can now run two external displays, but the laptop must be closed. It’s a handy feature for production environments or for presentations. This feature is also coming to the M3 MacBook Pro in a future macOS update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two external displays must support a video connection over USB-C or Thunderbolt 3. Also, the two displays can each be 5K at 60Hz, for example, two <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Apple Studio Displays</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to use dual external displays on M3 MacBooks. This demonstration involves a 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, an Apple Studio Display, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2195286/dough-spectrum-one-review.html\">Dough Spectrum One</a>, which is a 4K display with a variable refresh rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  3 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: M3 MacBook, two external Thunderbolt/USB-C displays, external input devices</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Get your Bluetooth input devices ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/magic-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-lightning.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Orange Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, Magic Keyboard\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A closed laptop means you can’t use the MacBook’s keyboard and trackpad. You must use an external keyboard, mouse, and/or trackpad. Set this up first.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Connect the displays to the MacBook</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/displays-connected-to-MacBook-Air.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MacBook Air display connectors\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The displays you are using should be able to do video over Thunderbolt or USB-C. Plug the cables from the displays into the two <a>MacBook Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the M3 MacBooks have only two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, all of the ports on the laptop will be occupied. The Studio Display has three USB-C ports, so if you need to connect USB-C devices, you need to plug them into the Studio Display. If you are using non-Apple displays, they may have hub support built in. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Close the MacBook</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-external-displays-laptop-closed.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"m3 macbook external displays laptop closed\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The M3 MacBooks can run only two displays at a time–that includes the laptop display. When the laptop is open, only one external display will work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To turn on the second display, simply close the laptop. After about five seconds, the second display will kick in.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>4.</span>\n<h3>What happens when the laptop is opened?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-external-displays-laptop-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MacBook Air open displays\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If you open the laptop, an external display goes dark, and the laptop display turns on.
