Calling it the largest community racing competition in cycling, last year’s event included over 80,000 participants. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Games 2025\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes1.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>New for the 2025 Zwift games, you’ll find five completely new routes across different Zwift worlds. These races will start short, but increase in duration with the final Stage 5 being “the ultimate racing challenge.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also new, the Zwift Games this year will feature 11 categories based on the new Zwift Racing Score which should make racing more fair, but also more competitive. Additional features include startline powerups, race results, global and stage leaderboards, and new official partners including Oakley, Nimbl, and Shimano. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, competitors will have the opportunity to unlock Oakley Velo Kato eyewar after completing 1 stage, Nimbl Ultimate shoes after 2 stages, and the Oakley Velo Mach Helmet after 3 stages. Finish all five stages and you’ll unlock the Zwift Games 2025 kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, the Zwift Games Elite consists of 5 stages across 3 consecutive Saturdays: March 8, March 15 and March 22. Two Sprint stages, two Climb stages and an Epic stage. The Zwift Games will crown men’s and women’s Champions across the Sprint, Climb and Epic disciplines as well as Overall Zwift Games Champions. Each of the 8 champions will also unlock the iconic golden Concept Z1 bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you want to test out the new routes, the Zwift Games Route Chaser Challenge is live now which gives you a chance to ride them, earn a new badge, and an extra 1000xp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/zwift-games\">Zwift Games 25</a> start March 3rd, and will run until the 30th.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zwift Big Spin is Back!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Zwift big spin 2025 decades clothing kit unlock prizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-big-spin-2025-decades-clothing-kit-unlock-prizes3.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-Big-Spin-BMX-Bandit-bike-1.png\"><img width=\"1222\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-Big-Spin-BMX-Bandit-bike-1.png\" alt=\"Zwift Big Spin BMX Bandit bike 1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-Big-Spin-BMX-Bandit-bike-1.png 1222w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-Big-Spin-BMX-Bandit-bike-1-297x98.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-Big-Spin-BMX-Bandit-bike-1-120x39.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zwift-Big-Spin-BMX-Bandit-bike-1-768x253.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have no intention of racing, you’ll want to log into Zwift from March 3 – April 7 to take advantage of the return of <a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/the-zwift-big-spin\" target=\"_blank\">the Big Spin</a>.
