Actor Hugh Grant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackedOffHugh/status/1788183871504204257\">referred to the ad</a> as the \"destruction of the human experience,\" director Reed Morano told Apple to \"read the room\" and called it \"actually psychotic,\" and Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/hating-apple-goes-mainstream-fe740007\">said it</a> \"symbolizes everything everyone has ever hated about digitization.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-crush-ad.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe upset over the Crush ad led Apple to issue an apology. In a <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/apple-apologizes-ipad-pro-crushed-ad-it-missed-mark/2559321\">statement to <em>Ad Age</em></a>, Apple marketing vice president Tor Myhren said that the video ultimately \"missed the mark.\"<blockquote>Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world. Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.</blockquote>Apple left the Crush video on its YouTube channel, but the ad won't be running on television.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/apple-crush-ad-apology/\">Apple Apologizes for 'Crush' iPad Pro Ad, Won't Put It on TV</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-apologizes-for-crush-ipad-pro-ad-wont-put-it-on-tv.2425951/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c084a48a4b6a0b704b8ef57a273263780c166d0a46731d565e825f1d1b964159","category":"Apple"}
