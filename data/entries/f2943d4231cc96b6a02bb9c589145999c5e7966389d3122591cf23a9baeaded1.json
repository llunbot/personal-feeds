This does not correlate with any existing Apple device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>91Mobiles</em> and several other sites have erroneously suggested that A2387 is also a new ‌iPad‌ model, but it actually relates to the battery for the current- and previous-generation 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>. A2386, on the other hand, is a new listing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not clear whether this device is a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> or ‌iPad Pro‌, but both product lines are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/\">expected to be refreshed in May</a>. New ‌iPad‌ models have been thought to be on the brink of launch for several weeks, and the latest regulatory filing seems to cement expectations that they will appear relatively soon.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/\">91Mobiles</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/new-ipad-models-spotted-in-regulatory-database/\">New iPad Model Spotted in Regulatory Database Ahead of Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-model-spotted-in-regulatory-database-ahead-of-launch.2423508/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f2943d4231cc96b6a02bb9c589145999c5e7966389d3122591cf23a9baeaded1","category":"Apple"}
