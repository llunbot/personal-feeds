Then you may be interested to learn that Google today launched its annual <a href=\"https://santatracker.google.com/\">Santa tracking feature</a>, allowing Santa to be tracked in real time on his journey to the North Pole as he prepares to deliver presents to kids around the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/santa-tracker-1.jpg\" width=\"2096\" height=\"1066\" />\r<br />\nGoogle's Santa Tracker continues a two-decade tradition for the company, allowing excited children (and grown-ups!) to keep up with the jolly gift-giver's travels throughout December 24. On this day, Santa's Village transforms into a tracking experience where children can follow Santa and his reindeer as they merrily go about their important work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSanta can be tracked using a web browser on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac by visiting Google's <a href=\"https://santatracker.google.com/\">official Santa Tracking website</a>. The site features a live map of Santa's current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his journey, and the estimated time that he will arrive in each specific location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Santa site provides pictures of locations that Santa has already visited, a live count of gifts that have been delivered, and Santa's current distance from your location. There are also a selection of games to play, creative things to do, and videos to watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther Santa tracking services are also available, such as the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/norad-tracks-santa-claus/id1181633163\">NORAD Tracks Santa Claus app</a> and website, but Google's site is often the most interactive and detailed. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/24/track-santas-journey-from-north-pole-2/\">Track Santa's Journey From the North Pole Using Google's Santa Tracker</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/track-santas-journey-from-the-north-pole-using-googles-santa-tracker.2414541/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f6e61af4b1e52a4951d80672bb607f210eb98a0e62bc1628722100e503dbc50","category":"Apple"}
