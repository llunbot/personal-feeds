A record-setting ride around the world in 2024. <strong>Clocking in at 108 days, 12 hours, and 12 minutes,</strong> for the entire ride. Lael didn’t just break the circumnavigation-by-bike world record; she reshaped what we thought was possible on two wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lael Rides Around the World | Full Film</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div><figcaption>The entire movie is available for free on YouTube. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Directed and documented by photojournalist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rugilekaladyte/?hl=en\">Rugile Kaladyte</a>, the feature-length film captures the raw, authentic moments behind the record. From euphoric stretches of endless tarmac to gritty emotional lows. The movie offers a front-row seat to an 18,000-mile odyssey driven by grit, community, and an unrelenting love for the bike. Along the way, Lael is joined by friends, fans, and fellow riders, transforming what could have been a solo mission into a rolling celebration of human connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lael-Rides-Around-the-World-cover-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1324\" height=\"1192\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lael-Rides-Around-the-World-cover-.png\" alt=\"Lael Rides Around the World cover\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lael-Rides-Around-the-World-cover-.png 1324w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lael-Rides-Around-the-World-cover--297x267.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lael-Rides-Around-the-World-cover--120x108.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lael-Rides-Around-the-World-cover--768x691.png 768w\" /></a><figcaption>For those who want to delve deeper and genuinely appreciate the visuals, there’s more to the experience than just the film.
