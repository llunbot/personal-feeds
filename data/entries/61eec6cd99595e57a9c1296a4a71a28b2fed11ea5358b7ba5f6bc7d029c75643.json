I bring this up because of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevin_degood/status/1431229853790085124\">an interesting—if infuriating—thread I read this morning</a> about Texas' plan to widen I-35 as it cuts through the heart of Austin.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the state wants to build more lanes, which it thinks will ease congestion. At some points, this could leave I-35 as much as <a href=\"https://austin.towers.net/widening-i-35-to-20-lanes-in-downtown-austin-is-the-anti-project-connect/\">20 lanes wide</a>; this will require bulldozing dozens of businesses along the way. An alternative that would have buried 12 lanes of the highway in two levels of underground tunnels was apparently considered too costly.</p>\n<p>But it would be wrong to single out this 8-mile proposal as an outlier. In Houston, the state plans to widen I-45 despite plenty of opposition, <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/transportation/2021/06/23/401359/txdot-kept-moving-forward-on-i-45-project-despite-federal-warning-documents-say/\">including from the Federal Highway Administration</a>. And you don't have to look far to see other state governments wanting to build new roads to reduce congestion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790231#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790231&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
