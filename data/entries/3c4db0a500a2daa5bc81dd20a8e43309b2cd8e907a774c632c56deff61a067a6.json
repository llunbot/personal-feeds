{"title":"Yamaha Bicycles Announces 30th Anniversary Special Edition eMTB","link":"https://bikerumor.com/yamaha-bicycles-special-edition-dx-moro-07/","date":1685023200000,"content":"<p>For many of us, our thirtieth birthday is an occasion to grasp our suddenly apparent mortality while wrestling with an inexplicably diminished alcohol metabolism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Yamaha Bicycles, it’s a chance to release a special edition YDX-MORO 07 eBike. And why not? Yamaha Bicycles first dropped a <a href=\"https://www.yamahabicycles.com/the-yamaha-evolution/\" target=\"_blank\">power-assist bike back in the grungy days of 1993</a>, and celebrating thirty years of eBikes is as good a reason as any to launch another. Of course, that also means Nirvana’s swan song album <em>In Utero</em> is 30 years old as well. Try not to think about it too much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, Yamaha hailed the launch with a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yamaha-bicycles-ydx-moro-e-mtb-with-pw-x3-drive/#:~:text=Yamaha%E2%80%99s%20passion%20for%20performance%20is%20driven%20by%20our%20racing%20heritage%2C%20and%20the%20YDX%2DMORO%2007%20and%20YDX%2DMORO%2005%20are%20true%20thoroughbreds%20for%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20e%2DMTB%20riders.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">vaguely familiar racehorse metaphor</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yamaha’s passion for performance is driven by our racing heritage, and the YDX-MORO 07 Special Edition is a true thoroughbred for the next generation of e-MTB riders,” Rob Trester, manager of Yamaha’s Smart Power Vehicle Division, said in a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s this…uh…stallion packing? Well, it’s Yamaha’s standard YDX-MORO 07 with a polished aluminum finish coat, a 30th Anniversary 3D badge on the top tube, and a commemorative decal on the seat tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"The YDX-MORO 07 Special Edition on a white background\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A little bit of a retro-futuristic thing going on here. It’s diggable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BikeRumor! covered Yamaha’s launch of the YDX-MORO 07 back in November 2022. As a refresh: Yamaha leans heavily on the PW-X3 drive unit when promoting the bike. The brand claims the PW-X3 is its “lightest, smallest, most powerful drive unit to date.” The unit sports torque up to 85Nm while delivering 250 watts of nominal assist and 500 watts of maximum assist (claimed). The assist modes are: ECO, Standard, High, MTB, Extra-Power, Automatic-Mode, and Walk Assist.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"The fork tube of the YDX-MORO 07 Special Edition\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-4-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the primary component specs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>RockShox Lyrik Select front fork with 160mm of travel, 35mm stanchions, Charger RC damper with Low-speed Compression and Rebound adjust.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RockShox Super Deluxe Select+ rear shocks custom tuned for the Yamaha YDX-MORO 07 with 150mm travel, 210 x 55mm DebonAir+ air spring with 15 clicks of rebound adjustment, and 2-position compression adjustment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>TranzX 30.9 diameter dropper post with 125mm travel (small), 150mm (medium), and 170mm (large).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shimano XT SL-M8100-R shifters, Shimano XT RD-M8100-SGS rear derailleur, and Shimano XT CS-M8100-12 12-spd (10-51T) cassette.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Magura MT5 4-piston brakes, with 203mm center lock rotor and single-finger lever.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maxxis 27.5×2.6 tubeless Minion DHF (front) and REKON (rear).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"A badge reading &quot;Power Assist System 30th Anniversary \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yamaha-5-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check out the rest of specs/geometry at <a href=\"http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.yamahabicycles.com/globalassets/2023-march-product-launch/all-bikes/ydx-moro-07-30th-anniversary/geometry/23_0331-onesheet_ydx-moro-07_se.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Yamaha Bicycles’ website</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The YDX MORO 07 Special edition comes with Yamaha Bicycles’ standard three-year warranty on the frame, battery, and motor.
