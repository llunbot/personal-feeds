Instead riders would stuff their <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pack-your-cycling-jersey-pockets-like-a-pro\">jersey pockets</a> to the brim with tools, tubes and food to sustain them on their exploits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\">gravel riding</a> rolled along and, as it has done to many facets of cycling, threw common thinking and ‘the done way’ completely out of the window. Tubes became larger, a wider range of tools became a necessity and riders were no longer wearing the traditional jersey with pockets. And so the bar bag exploded in popularity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re in the market for a bar bag, you’ll notice that there’s quite the range on offer, from those that are perfect for just the essentials to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\">bikepacking</a> behemoths that are designed for the gnarliest of adventures. There’s a host of materials, styles, and volumes on offer so it should be reasonably straightforward to find one that fits your requirements. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best bar bags 2023 </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/altura-vortex-handlebar-bag-review\">Altura Vortex</a></strong>: £65</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/evoc-boa-handlebar-bag-review\">Evoc Boa</a></strong>: £140</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wizard-works-lil-presto-handlebar-bag-review\">Wizard Works Lil Presto</a></strong>: £65</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/apidura-expedition-handlebar-bag-review\">Apidura Expedition</a></strong>: £100</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pro-discover-handlebar-bag-8l-review\">Pro Discover</a></strong>: £70</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/aravis-handlebar-bag-review\">Aravis Echappe</a></strong>: £60</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/restrap-canister-handlebar-bag-review\">Restrap Canister</a></strong>: £49</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/camelchops-blimp-2-handlebar-bag-review\">CamelChops Blimp</a></strong>: £46</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/dyed-in-the-wool-bar-roll-review\">Dyed in the Wool Bar Roll</a></strong>: £89</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/jango-rolls-bar-roll-review\">Jango Rolls</a></strong>: £40</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/brooks-scape-handlebar-pouch-review\">Brooks Scape</a></strong>: £59</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/chrome-industries-helix-handlebar-bag-review\">Chrome Industries Helix</a></strong>: £58</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test and why you should take our word for it</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/07094819/bikepacking-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"bikepacking\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re in the very lucky position here at <em>Cyclist </em>to be testing new bikes and kit year round, often with multiple bikes on the go at once.

For those looking to carry larger loads as part of their bikepacking setup capacity is obviously an important spec, but waterproofness and ease of access are also important too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to carry your ride essentials on the bike instead of jersey pockets, there are plenty of options with smaller capacity too with similar weatherproofing attributes to the larger bags. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these bags are handmade so offer colour customisation and a few will go even further and make an entirely custom bag for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day there are plenty of options in terms of size, colour and features, so with a bit of digging (or reading this guide!) you’ll find something out there for you.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

bikepacking end of the spectrum, with its generous 5l, fully waterproof capacity. Using a pair of roll closures, it’s easy to secure smaller loads but equally thanks to the front stash area it’s possible to carry items externally too. On the front of the bag is a small waterproof pocket that would be ideal for carrying a battery pack or other loose items. This pocket using a closure akin to a ziplock bag which is something we haven’t seen before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our gripe with roll closures, especially on drop bar bikes, is that it can be a bit of a faff to get things out of the bag without removing it from the bars as the hoods often get in the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mounting system has a number of options with spacing to make sure there’s no interference with bar mounted accessories and Altura includes a pack of foam spacers to keep the bag free from cables.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/altura-vortex-handlebar-bag-review\"><strong>Altura Vortex handlebar bag review</strong></a></li><li><strong>Buy the Altura Vortex now from <a href=\"https://www.altura.co.uk/luggage-c4/styles-c76/bar-bags-c82/vortex-waterproof-cycling-front-roll-p119#attribute%5B4%5D=44\" target=\"_blank\">Altura (£39)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Evoc Boa</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Evoc3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£120</li><li>2.5-litre capacity</li><li>BOA Closure</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name might suggest, this handlebar bag from German luggage experts Evoc uses a Boa system to attach the bag to the bars. At first, we were sceptical; what’s wrong with tried and tested Velcro? A lot, as it turns out. After a bit of practice, we had the Boa Handlebar Pack on and off the bars in a flash. Simply loop the rubberised tags around the bar, slot them into place and turn the dial until everything is locked in. It’s a very sturdy method of attachment and one that we could see becoming more widespread if it weren’t for the additional cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the bag uses roll closures to keep the contents inside dry and the centre of the bag is formed into a tube to provide a little structure. A bungee criss-crosses the exterior for more storage potential.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d wager it’s too small for longer bikepacking trips but if you only need to carry a few spares or a jacket, it’s an ideal size. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/evoc-boa-handlebar-bag-review\"><strong>Evoc Boa handlebar bag review</strong></a></li><li><strong>Buy the Evoc Boa now from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Evoc-Waterproof-2-5L-Boa-Handlebar-Pack_261521.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (£99.99)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wizard Works Lil Presto</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/WizardWorks1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£65</li><li>2.15-litre capacity</li><li>Fully custom designs available </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lil Presto Barrel Bag from Wizard Works attaches to your handlebars using a pair of Voile Nano rubber straps which we’ve found to be very secure even over surfaces that are barely worthy of the gravel moniker. The slight stretch in the straps meant we achieve good tension with minimal effort. A nylon drawcord then wraps around the headtube to prevent any vertical bouncing and swaying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body of the Lil Presto is semi-rigid thanks to a sheet of HPDE, which keeps its shape regardless of how much stuff you try and cram in. The rigid body also means it’s much easier to open and close the bag with one hand while on the move. Cordura fabric and a YKK Aquaguard zip help to protect the contents from the elements but the Lil Presto does not claim to be waterproof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found the Lil Presto to be deceptively roomy and smaller tools and keys would often get lost at the bottom, so it’s probably one to keep larger items in.  Two elasticated side pockets were an ideal place to stash empty wrappers and the daisy chain on the front opens up a world of possibilities to attach lights and mugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the name of coordination and aesthetics, Wizard Works can make a custom bag to match your pride and joy if you so wish. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wizard-works-lil-presto-handlebar-bag-review\" target=\"_blank\"> Wizard Works Lil Presto handlebar bag review</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buy the Wizard Works Lil Presto handlebar bag from<a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/shop/bags/bar-stem-bags/lil-presto-barrel-bag/\" target=\"_blank\"> Wizard Works (£65)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apidura Expedition </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Apidura4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£100</li><li>9-litre capacity</li><li>Three layer laminated fabric</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Expedition handlebar pack from Apidura is pitched towards the bikepacking/adventure crowd just because of its capacity. The model we’ve got on test is the 9-litre but there’s also a 14L if you find yourself needing even more room.  Constructed from a three-layer laminated fabric developed exclusively for Apidura, it’s claimed to be lightweight, abrasion resistant and completely waterproof thanks to the use of welded seams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubberised nylon straps and plastic Woojin buckles are used to attach the bag to the bars; it’s a bit of a fiddly process so it’s not a bag that we’d be regularly taking on and off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the other larger bags, it uses a roll closure and a web of bungee cord on the top that allows jackets etc to be secure but easily accessible. The bag is shapeless when empty so it requires some careful packing to make sure loads won’t shift around when riding but it does mean you could probably cram more in than the more structured bags. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apidura offers a range of small expansion packs that would keep small items such as a phone or wallet within reach. Reflective details and a light attachment point are also present for enhanced safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/apidura-expedition-handlebar-bag-review\">Apidura Expedition handlebar bag review</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buy the Apidura Expedition now from <a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/item/Apidura/Expedition-Handlebar-Pack-9L/FND0\" target=\"_blank\">Sigma Sports (£96)</a> </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pro Discover </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/ProDiscover3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£69</li><li>8-litre capacity</li><li>Modular design</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro Discover handlebar bag is one of the more unique bags we’ve seen; adopting a two-part system that adds enormous flexibility with what you can carry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system comprises of an 8-litre stuff sack with roll closures, which isn’t dissimilar to the Apidura, Evoc and Altura packs, but the way it attaches to the bars is. After packing the stuff sack, it’s then strapped to the harness, which uses a pair of straps and buckles to attach the bag to the bars. When we first tried it, we weren’t 100% convinced as it seemed to add another step in an already fiddly process but as we became more familiar with the system It made a load of sense. Firstly, it means that there’s no faffing about looping straps over handlebars while avoiding cables and computers every time you want something from the bag; the harness remains fixed to the bars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The harness can be used on its own as well to carry a tent or sleeping pad, so there’s plenty of flexibility should you need it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both elements are made from highly durable, anti-abrasion fabric so will keep going on even the most epic adventures. A headtube strap keeps everything sturdy and the ubiquitous bungee cords are present on the top for extra load capacity. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pro-discover-handlebar-bag-8l-review\"><strong>Pro Discover handlebar bag review</strong></a></li><li><strong>Buy the Pro Discover now from <a href=\"https://www.freewheel.co.uk/pro-discover-handlebar-bag-8l-prsba0052\" target=\"_blank\">Freewheel (£69.99)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aravis Echappe</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Aravis-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£60</li><li>3-litre capacity</li><li>Made with Ecopak composite fabric</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a few other bags on this list, the Aravis Handlebar Bag is handmade and there’s an option to have a completely custom bag if the six standard colours clash with your kit. Aravis has used Ecopak throughout here, which is the world’s first compostable fabric, made from 100% recycled fibre and film. This doesn’t mean they’ve scrimped on waterproofing though as it’s fully waterproof and the YKK Aquaguard zipper won’t let any water through the zip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bag attaches to the bars using a pair of FixLock buckles and nylon straps; there’s a bungee cord too that wraps around the headtube for extra stability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As standard the bag has a sheet of plastic in the lining to add some rigidity, but if you’d prefer a more freeform bag it can be removed. Deep, elasticated pockets can be found on either end and for an extra £10, the bag comes with a shoulder strap so you can detach the bag and sling it over your shoulder at the café stop. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/aravis-handlebar-bag-review\">Aravis Echappe handlebar bag review</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wizard-works-lil-presto-handlebar-bag-review\"></a>Aravis Echappe handlebar bag from <a href=\"https://aravisbagworks.com/collections/handlebar-bags\" target=\"_blank\">Aravis (£60)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Restrap Canister</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Restrap3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£49</li><li>1.5-litre capacity</li><li>Lifetime warranty</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the smallest bags in this guide, the Restrap Canister Bag only has a capacity of 1.5 litres, but we’ve found that to be the sweet spot for longer day rides where we need to carry food, tools and an extra layer.

Being so small, it’s very unobtrusive on the bars and we barely noticed it was there. It’s designed to sit <em>under</em> the bars rather than in front like some of the other bags, so accessing the contents on the move is a bit more of a challenge just because you need to reach down and under the bars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a chunky zip pull, which made life a little easier when wearing thick gloves, and the YKK Aquaguard zip will keep out the worst of the weather. A pair of Velcro straps secure the bag to the bars and the distance between the straps is adjustable to get the perfect fitment. The pockets on either end of the bag are pretty small but they’ll have a use for someone, somewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the bag is custom made, Jango Rolls can make it in any colour and custom sizes too if there isn’t anything available off the shelf that fits your needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/jango-rolls-bar-roll-review\">Jango Rolls handlebar bag review</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wizard-works-lil-presto-handlebar-bag-review\"></a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/apidura-expedition-handlebar-bag-review\"></a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/aravis-handlebar-bag-review\"></a>Jango Rolls handlebar bag from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/apidura-expedition-handlebar-bag-review\"></a></strong><a href=\"https://www.jangorolls.com/shop\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jango Rolls (£40)</strong></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brooks Scape Handlebar Pouch</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-970x645.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Brooks-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£59</li><li>3-litre capacity</li><li>Aluminium hardware</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Brooks has gained a reputation for exceptionally well-made products and the Scape Handlebar Pouch is no exception; using a welded construction and waterproof materials, the Scape is ready for the soggiest of adventures, furthered by a YKK Aquaguard zip that is protected from the elements by an extended flap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, there’s metal hardware on the fixing buckles and a slew of different sized foam spacers to get the perfect fit on the bars, although there’s no width adjustability so your handlebar furniture might need to be rearranged to get everything to fit. A headtube strap is included to prevent undue swaying over bumpy terrain and a web of loops across the front is ideal for attaching a light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a very understated bag and one that wouldn’t look out of place on most bikes. We’d say it’s right in the sweet spot in terms of volume for carrying the essentials and an extra layer during changeable conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/brooks-scape-handlebar-pouch-review\"><strong>Brooks Scape handlebar pouch review</strong></a></li><li><strong>By the Brooks Scape now from <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/p/brooks-england-scape-handlebar-pouch\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles (£59.99)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Chrome Industries Helix</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"helix_on_bike_2\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/07093509/helix_on_bike_2-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>£58</li><li>3-litre capacity</li><li>Well-made and stylish</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chrome Industries Helix bag is a neat rectangle with a pair of net side pockets to keep essentials to hand. Despite its large 3-litre capacity, it doesn’t feel as if it swamps the handlebars and it doesn’t impact the performance of control cables. It attaches to the bike quickly with two Velcro straps on the bars and a head tube strap. It also comes with a shoulder strap that tucks into a pouch at the bag’s rear, so it’s equally adept at off-bike duties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Helix bag isn’t designed to be fully waterproof, although it will see off the odd shower. In a heatwave, we weren’t too worried, but this might be a show-stopper if you’re planning a serious bikepacking trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/chrome-industries-helix-handlebar-bag-review\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome Industries Helix handlebar bag review</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wizard-works-lil-presto-handlebar-bag-review\"></a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/apidura-expedition-handlebar-bag-review\"></a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/aravis-handlebar-bag-review\"></a>Chrome Industries Helix now from <a href=\"https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/chrome-helix-handlebar-bag-handlebar-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">Alpinetrek (£44.16)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Planning a big trip?
