That story runs below this update.</p>\n<p>The patent seemingly confirms the new lever shape, the presence of a new auxiliary button – which it is suggested could be customisable – plus some internal redesigns.</p>\n<p>Primarily, the hydraulic reservoir is shown to be larger, and oriented horizontally. It’s indicated that this could be used to increase the reservoir volume.</p>\n<p>The brake-lever pivot points are higher than in previous SRAM designs, while the master cylinder piston looks to push in to move the fluid, rather than a pull-rod system as used previously.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"New SRAM Red AXS lever patent image\" title=\"New SRAM Red AXS lever patent image\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The external shape resembles the one we spotted in December 2022.

The Japanese brand claims a higher pivot point improves leverage, while it also uses a push-rod style.</p>\n<p>The patent also reveals SRAM’s intention to move to a tool-free bite point adjustment.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"New SRAM Red AXS lever patent image\" title=\"New SRAM Red AXS lever patent image\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new lever design sees a substantial internal rework.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM / USPTO</i></span></div>\n<p>Where this is currently achievable using a hex key, the new levers feature a cam adjustor under the hoods (positioned towards the rear).

This may have been to satisfy the demands for ever-lighter components from professional riders.</p>\n<p>While it looked like a finished product, it’s also conceivable this was something of a stop-gap.</p>\n<p>Van Anrooij may simply have preferred the slimmer and shorter shape of the Rival eTap AXS shifters, prompting SRAM to make custom models with carbon levers to save weight and oversized branding to maintain their prominence in photographs.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Prototype SRAM road shifter on Shirin van Anrooij's bike during the women's race of the Superprestige Boom cyclocross race\" title=\"16th UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup Antwerpen 2022 - Women's Elite\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Van Anrooij’s bike is otherwise built up with current-generation components.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Luc Claessen/Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The shifters spotted on Movistar Team bikes, however, looked completely new.</p>\n<p>The shifter bodies appeared to have been slimmed down compared to the current versions, with a smaller bump on the top.</p>\n<p>The DoubleTap shifter paddles have also grown in size significantly, now reaching much further up the brake lever than before.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Prototype SRAM road shifter on a Movistar Team bike\" title=\"New SRAM shifter_Movistar_01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The unbranded levers suggest these are still in prototype form.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Movistar Team</i></span></div>\n<p>We don’t expect SRAM to change from its DoubleTap shifting logic (right button for a harder gear, left for easier, both to shift at the front).</p>\n<p>Instead, we expect this to simply be a refinement of the system, making it easier to reach the shift paddles with different hand positions.</p>\n<p>The brake lever also appeared slightly elongated, curving out a little more towards the top of the blade, before swooping back in and then out again to create finger hooks when riding in the drops.</p>\n<p>One blurry image also suggested the existence of an auxiliary button on the inside of the shifter hood.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Prototype SRAM road shifter on a Movistar Team bike\" title=\"New SRAM shifter_Movistar_02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It looks as if SRAM has added an extra button to the hoods of its prototype shifters.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Movistar Team</i></span></div>\n<p>We suggested that these could be intended to function similarly to the buttons on the top of Shimano Di2 shifters, which are generally used to control <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computers</a> without moving your hands from the brake levers.</p>\n<p>In fact, this shifter design shares a striking overall similarity to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-grx-di2-review/\">Shimano GRX Di2</a> shifters.
