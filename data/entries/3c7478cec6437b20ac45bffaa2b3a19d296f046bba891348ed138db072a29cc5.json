Palm and feet numbness are high on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike-fitter Lee Endres works at Bicycle in Richmond (which you may have heard of thanks to its excellent reputation and link with YouTuber Francis Cade) and is happy to give me a better understanding on the topic.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He worked at Giant for five years before moving into bike-fitting and is keen to share how bike-fitting has progressed over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Bike-fit used to be more about looking at numbers, computers and technology rather than actually looking at the individuals,’ says Endres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It used to be a case of applying exactly what you see on the computer rather than actually looking at the rider and seeing it from that side too. There was also a case of fitting the rider to the bike and telling them to go home and stretch. At the end of the day If you don’t stretch now, you are probably never going to.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Long distance vs everyday riding</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m keen to understand whether there is any difference between a bike-fitter’s approach for a long-distance rider compared to an everyday distance one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our usual process before the bike-fit starts with understanding what the individual wants from the appointment, which will in some ways affect the way I do the fit, but not the outcome,’ explains Endres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For example, if someone is embarking on a 1,000-mile trip and another is just milling around town but both have the same problem of numb feet, it’s going to be slightly harder to figure out why the long distance rider is getting numb feet. This is due to the training loads, the fact that they are used to riding, I would assume, for many years. So the fit would start out a little slower and I would take longer to work with the feet.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">Best of the best gravel bikes 2023: Cyclist’s top-rated gravel and adventure bikes</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-stem-length-do-i-need\">What stem length do I need?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/man-vs-machine-inside-contemporary-bike-fitting\">Man vs machine: Inside contemporary bike fitting</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-guide-to-bike-fitting\">Cyclist guide to bike fitting</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Does having bags on the bike make a difference?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Bags will affect you,’ says Endres. ‘This depends on the bag system, but you may have to sit down more. It is important to evenly distribute the weight but you will be most impacted when climbing, and more likely to dorsiflex – drop the heel – so it is advisable to take time climbing when heavy bags are on.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Women, women, women</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/ezgif.com-optimize.gif\" alt width=\"510\" height=\"287\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no secret that women have different needs to men when it comes to bikes, and that the bike industry typically takes a more male-biased view on its creations, so how does this materialise in a bike fit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The most fundamental changes we make for women are narrower bars, shorter cranks and lots of testing of different saddles,’ explains Endres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Stock bikes will always come with incorrect bars that are too wide, cranks that are too long and the saddle will usually not be optimal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Unfortunately smaller bikes and larger bikes tend to be overlooked in the design and manufacturing process and will never ride as well as say a size medium or 54cm frame size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Toe overlap is something that is a common issue for women – and there are various ways to overcome this such as crank length, 650b wheels and correct-sized shoes. Plus taller women generally have smaller feet than men of the same height so looking into different length cranks is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They also generally have narrower shoulders so matching that with narrower bars tends to improve hand comfort and also being able to reach brake levers which is also a massive issue as women generally have smaller hands.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would all these issues be fixed with a women-specific bike? It’s a huge topic for which Endres has a simple answer: ‘Women’s bikes are simply not there yet.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The bike-fit</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>First impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as I’m on the jig, which Endres has adapted to replicate my exact current setup, it’s suddenly overwhelmingly clear that my Fizik Luce R5 saddle is not comfortable, to the point where I deeply consider what I have been putting my backside through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiftly swapped out for another, and another, and another, the saddle saga finally settles with an Ergon Women’s SR, a saddle I have used before and know I like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endres also drops my saddle height down from 78.2 to 77.5, and changes my saddle angle from -3.7 to -2 degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hunched up</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-5.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Palm numbness is something I really struggle with after a few days on the bike which Endres explains can be a repetitive strain due to bar width, reach and palms rolling out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s abundantly clear that I am overreaching, and my shoulder are rather hunched up, so Endres brings in my reach by 24mm, and I notice a drastic improvement. He recommends I swap my current 100mm stem out for an 80mm one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endres also swaps my bars for a narrower set but this doesn’t make an overwhelming difference, so we stick with the original 42.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best foot forward</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/bike-fit-emma-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also suffer with numb feet and I have Morton’s neuroma in my right foot, which can often lead to a lot of jumping off the bike and flapping around. It’s not the most enjoyable experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endres shows me that while my Quoc shoes are the right size and width, my feet are not stabilised within them. He focusses on stabilising my feet in my shoes, adding orthotics, with arch support and 3mm heel raisers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back on the bike, my feet feel different, but good different, and comparing my pedalling and feet drop before and after the fit everything looks much more stable.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endres also recentres my cleat to the back and the change in efficiency of pedal stroke is marked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For a longer foot, we move the cleat backwards, which helps riders be less toey and can help with numbness,’ says Endres. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever moved a cleat forwards.

I try out three different options, my original at 172.5mm, 170mm and 176.5mm but delighted for me (and my bank balance) my crank length remains as the original.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Key takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The video shows my fit before I saw Lee on the left, and the result of the process on the right. The whole bike fit process took about three hours, during which we chatted, tested, and Endres tinkered and explained as he went along. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most was done as a blind test, I didn’t know which cranks I was trying, what size axle pedals I was using or much else. I simply explained how I was feeling and where I was feeling it, and Endres dabbled where necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The differences weren’t drastic in terms of reducing the reach, adding orthotics, changing saddle and saddle height, and changing pedals, but they were improvements nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the bike-fit, I haven’t had palm or feet numbness anywhere near as severely as before. I feel more comfortable on the bike and I’ve definitely noticed my feet are much more stabilised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time will tell when I cycle for two weeks on the trot to Tunisia as to whether these issues have really gone, but I am hopeful.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-bike-fit\">Tunisia Diaries: I’m cycling 2,311km so it’s time for a bike-fit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3c7478cec6437b20ac45bffaa2b3a19d296f046bba891348ed138db072a29cc5","category":"Cycling"}
