A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7247a1.htm?s_cid=mm7247a1_w\">report of the cluster and what it might mean</a> is published today by Michigan health officials in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>\n<p>Eye syphilis, aka ocular syphilis, is not new. Syphilis bacteria, <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (formerly <em>Spirochaeta pallida</em>) are known to be able to spread to the eye, as well as the inner ear, and central nervous system when the sexually transmitted infection is left untreated.
