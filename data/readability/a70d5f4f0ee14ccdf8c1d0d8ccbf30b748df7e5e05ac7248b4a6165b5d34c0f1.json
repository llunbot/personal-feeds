Using the Benno Boost e-cargo bike as the base, they’ve outfitted it with an overlanding setup that’s equal parts camping, trailbuilding, and bug-outting capable.</p><p>Designed to work as a cargo bike but with handling and ride quality similar to a regular bike, the Boost is Benno’s biggest bike so far. It’s running 24″ wheels front and rear, with a slightly elongated trunk to give it a longer rack and more cargo space.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15105943/benno-boost-cargo-e-bike-with-overlanding-camping-trailbuilder-setup-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15105943/benno-boost-cargo-e-bike-with-overlanding-camping-trailbuilder-setup-01.jpg\" alt=\"benno boost e-cargo bike with studded mountain bike tires and overlanding setup with stove and axe\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15105943/benno-boost-cargo-e-bike-with-overlanding-camping-trailbuilder-setup-01.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15105943/benno-boost-cargo-e-bike-with-overlanding-camping-trailbuilder-setup-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15105943/benno-boost-cargo-e-bike-with-overlanding-camping-trailbuilder-setup-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15105943/benno-boost-cargo-e-bike-with-overlanding-camping-trailbuilder-setup-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15105943/benno-boost-cargo-e-bike-with-overlanding-camping-trailbuilder-setup-01-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>They call it an “Etility” bike, and with the vast array of racks, mounts, and accessories available, it’s easy to make it find the type of utility you need.</p><p>Not only do they have an extensive catalog of add ons (it comes with the rear rack as standard), you can also choose between one of four Bosch Performance Line drive systems – Speed, CX, Sport, and base model – giving you both Class 1 and 3 options based on where you live (or how much you want to spend).

It’s rolling on 20″ wheels with fat 4.5″ tires for mega grip and a smoother ride.
