The more capable version of ‌Siri‌ allows the voice assistant to control actions within Apps, allowing it to understand what is currently on-screen and determine what to do based on context.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence launches in the fall. While the entire new version of ‌Siri‌ will not be available at this time, other ‌Siri‌ features, such as a new design and ChatGPT integration, should be present upon the debut of Apple Intelligence this year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier today, Gurman explained that both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/\">feature a new processor</a> that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could \"lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road,\" it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring \"the full initiative\" to the Apple Watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/\">previously reported</a> that Apple Intelligence will come to the Vision Pro headset next year.
