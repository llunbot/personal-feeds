We thought we'd test out the spatial Persona feature to see how it works and whether it's an improvement over the regular Persona option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nSpatial Personas have a translucent background and include the head, hands, and top part of the torso to provide a more natural feel so that it seems like the people in the conversation are in the same physical room with one another. With spatial Personas, people can move about in their real world space, and that's reflected in the virtual setting. Persona location is the same for all people on a call, so if there are five participants, each one has a different location just as they would sitting together in a room.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you look at or point to someone on the call, the other participants can see where you are looking or pointing. Voices are also directional relative to where each person is at.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStandard Personas show only a person's face and are limited to a small tile, but spatial Personas have a much more immersive feel. Apple has been improving Personas since the Vision Pro headset launched, and while there's still an uncanny valley feel to them, the visuals are much improved and overall less creepy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpatial Personas can be used for watching movies and TV shows together, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> and other video calls, using apps like Freeform, playing games, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of right now, spatial Personas are live in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> in a beta capacity, with the ‌visionOS‌ 1.1 update required. Spatial Personas work with up to five participants.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/testing-vision-pro-spatial-persona/\">Testing the New Apple Vision Pro Spatial Persona</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-the-new-apple-vision-pro-spatial-persona.2423452/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"31215cd0170fc9e480580c7cf36d3eddecf1eadcb73d239ed9bfde6a7b85bb01","category":"Apple"}
