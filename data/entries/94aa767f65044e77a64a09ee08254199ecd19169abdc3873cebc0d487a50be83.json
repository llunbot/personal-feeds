2006 (when it sponsored AG2R Prévoyance), Decathlon is back as a bike supplier, again to the AG2R setup, with a five-year deal that will see riders being consulted on future bike designs.</p>\n<p>The RCR Pro frameset is an all-rounder that has drawn many comparisons to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl7-review/\">Specialized Tarmac

expect many of the Decathlon AG2R riders to use this bike for the majority of the 2024 season.</p>\n<p>However, Van Rysel has already revealed a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bike</a>, called the FCR, is on its way. AG2R’s new sprinter, the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-jersey-colours/\">Tour de France green jersey</a> winner, Sam Bennett, may therefore switch between the two depending on a race’s terrain.</p>\n<p>During the design phase of the RCR, Decathlon has leaned on the expertise of Onera, a French aerospace company that has its offices a short walk from Decathlon’s Lille HQ.</p>\n<p>The front of the bike is fully integrated and features a subtle hourglass head tube with a truncated trailing edge.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n
