{"title":"CNet Deletes Thousands of Old Articles in Futile, Wrong-Headed Attempt to Game Google Search","link":"https://gizmodo.com/cnet-deletes-thousands-old-articles-google-search-seo-1850721475","date":1691706557000,"content":"\n<p>Thomas Germain, reporting for Gizmodo:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Archived copies of CNET’s author pages show the company deleted\nsmall batches of articles prior to the second half of July, but\nthen the pace increased. Thousands of articles disappeared in\nrecent weeks. A CNET representative confirmed that the company was\nculling stories but declined to share exactly how many it has\ntaken down. The move adds to recent controversies over CNET’s\neditorial strategy, which has included layoffs and experiments\nwith error-riddled articles <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/cnet-ai-chatgpt-tech-news-1850017739\">written by AI chatbots</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“Removing content from our site is not a decision we take lightly.\nOur teams analyze many data points to determine whether there are\npages on CNET that are not currently serving a meaningful\naudience. This is an industry-wide best practice for large sites\nlike ours that are primarily driven by SEO traffic,” said Taylor\nCanada, CNET’s senior director of marketing and communications.\n“In an ideal world, we would leave all of our content on our site\nin perpetuity. Unfortunately, we are penalized by the modern\ninternet for leaving all previously published content live on our\nsite.” A representative for the CNET Media Workers Union declined\nto comment. (Disclosure: Gizmodo’s Editor in Chief Dan Ackerman is\na former CNET employee.)</p>\n\n<p>CNET shared an <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23903730-faq-on-cnet-content-pruning-aug-2023\">internal memo</a> about the practice. Removing,\nredirecting, or refreshing irrelevant or unhelpful URLs “sends a\nsignal to Google that says CNET is fresh, relevant and worthy of\nbeing placed higher than our competitors in search results,” the\ndocument reads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you think it sounds really stupid that Google would penalize websites in search rankings for new content because they’re hosting an archive of older content, you’re right, that is stupid. And Google isn’t stupid. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1689018769782476800\">From Google’s Search Liaison Twitter account yesterday</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are you deleting content from your site because you somehow\nbelieve Google doesn’t like “old” content? That’s not a thing! Our\nguidance doesn’t encourage this. Older content can still be\nhelpful, too. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content\">Learn more about creating helpful\ncontent</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Countering this clear message from Google <em>not</em> to do this, Gizmodo cites the other side:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, SEO experts told Gizmodo content pruning can be a useful\nstrategy in some cases, but it’s an “advanced” practice that\nrequires high levels of expertise, according to Chris Rodgers,\nfounder and CEO of CSP, an SEO agency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Expertise you can only obtain by hiring a firm like CSP, of course. And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Just because Google says that deleting content in isolation\ndoesn’t provide any SEO benefit, this isn’t always true,” said\nLily Ray, Senior Director of SEO and Head of Organic Research at\nAmsive Digital.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is like quoting voodoo witch doctors arguing that voodoo sometimes works.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/10/cnet-dummies\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9e48db83c97757774d6a8f18d164d03de48b8a9d9d8268d9dd1d5498682461a9","category":"Tech"}
