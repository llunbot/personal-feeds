The motor will get its power from a rechargeable battery mounted on the bike.</p>\n<p>To classify as an ebike, the motor has to help you rather than propel you on its own. As a result, you need to pedal to get that assistance. How much power the motor delivers is regulated based on how hard you are pedalling and the level of support you have selected.</p>\n<p>Electric bike systems offer a number of modes to choose from, allowing you to balance the amount of power supplied through the pedals with range and battery life.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Momentum Transend E+ eBike\" title=\"Momentum Transend E+ - 14\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Electric bike assistance is restricted to 15.5mph in the UK, EU and Australia.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-laws/\">Electric bike laws</a> on how much help the motor can provide, and the speed at which assistance cuts out, vary around the world. But in general the motor is limited to 250 watts output and must cut out when your speed reaches 25kph/15.5mph, except in the USA where it can continue to work up to 20mph.</p>\n<p>You can go faster than that, of course, but only under your own effort – the bike’s motor will no longer provide assistance.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h4>Electric bike laws in the UK</h4>\n<p>According to the Department for Transport (in the UK), for a bike to be classified as an electrically assisted pedal cycle (EAPC), it must have pedals used to propel it, and meet the following requirements.</p>\n<p>It must show either: </p>\n<ul><li>the power output </li>\n<li>the manufacturer of the motor </li>\n</ul><p>It must also show either: </p>\n<ul><li>the battery’s voltage </li>\n<li>the maximum speed of the bike </li>\n</ul><p>Its electric motor: </p>\n<ul><li>must have a maximum power output of 250 watts </li>\n<li>should not be able to propel the bike when it’s travelling more than 15.5mph</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>How does an electric bike work?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Volt London commuter eBike\" title=\"Volt London - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An electric bike offers motorised help when you turn the cranks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>An electric bike will typically have a motor housed either centrally on the bike (often referred to as a mid-drive motor, powered through the cranks) or on the front or rear hub.</p>\n<p>Whereas a hub-based motor will push the wheel around directly, an axle-mounted motor will work through the ebike’s chain and gears.</p>\n<p>When you pedal, a torque sensor will measure how much effort you are putting in and match that to the motor’s power output.</p>\n<p>The idea is that the motor won’t completely take over; instead, you should get consistent power delivery that won’t send the bike lurching forward.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bosch Performance Line CX Race electric mountain bike motor\" title=\"Bosch Performance Line CX Race electric mountain bike motor-12\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Electric bikes can help riders tackle difficult terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Marc Marshall / Bosch</i></span></div>\n<p>Therefore, one of many <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ebike-benefits/\">benefits of riding an electric bike</a> is you still have to press on the pedals and get exercise. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/electric-bike-fitness/\">Riding an electric bike for fitness</a> is eminently possible.</p>\n<p>Power comes from the battery, which might be mounted on the outside of the frame or hidden within it.</p>\n<p>Many batteries can be removed for charging, although others need to be charged on the bike. If that’s the case, you need to have somewhere to park the bike near a power socket.</p>\n<p>There will be a controller for the motor, usually mounted on the handlebar or integrated within the frame, that lets you decide how much assistance you want, and to keep an eye on the battery level. Some will include a screen with navigation and other functions too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano EP8 85Nm on the Giant Revolt E+ adventure eBike\" title=\"Giant Revolt E+ - 04\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Electric bike motors are held either in the middle of the bike, as shown here, or in one of the wheel hubs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bosch, Shimano, Yamaha, Specialized, Mahle, FSA and Fazua all make popular ebike motors. Specifications can vary significantly and the type of motor found on a bike will depend on its price and the type of riding intended.</p>\n<p>For example, an electric road bike is more likely to favour a lightweight system with smooth power delivery, whereas a motor on a high-spec electric mountain bike is likely to offer more torque for off-road capability.</p>\n<h2>How do you regulate motor power?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Controller on the Giant Revolt E+ adventure eBike\" title=\"Giant Revolt E+ - 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can usually alter the level of assistance with a frame-mounted button, as pictured here, or a controller on the handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>An electric bike will usually have between three and five levels of assistance, selected via its controller.</p>\n<p>These can give you anything from a gentle push to lots of power for tackling steep off-road climbs, depending on the specifications of the bike’s motor.</p>\n<p>Some will also have a ‘boost’ button, which you can use to increase the power output for short bursts of additional power.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Man and woman stopped on ebikes\" title=\"Cycle to Work Day 20224\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many electric bikes have a walk-assist mode to help you push the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many bikes also offer a walk-assist mode, to make it easier to push when you’re off the bike.</p>\n<p>You can change between assistance levels as you ride and there’s usually the option to switch the motor off completely and ride under pedal power alone.</p>\n<p>Many ebike motors are designed to be drag-free when switched off, but there is still the additional weight to overcome.</p>\n<h2>How much weight does an ebike motor and battery add?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the LeMond Prolog electric road bike\" title=\"LeMond Prolog - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is an ebike?

The motor will make initial acceleration much easier and then help you keep up to speed, particularly when you need to climb a hill.</p>\n<p>However, because of the extra weight from the motor and battery, an electric bike may handle a bit more sluggishly than a non-assisted bike.</p>\n<p>It may also have wider tyres to carry the extra weight and provide more grip, and it will usually have disc brakes because there’s more mass to slow down and stop.</p>\n<h2>What range will an electric bike have?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Trek Powerfly FS9 Equipped eBike for commuting with the off-road fun of a mountain bike\" title=\"Trek Powerfly FS9 Equipped - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The motor type and battery capacity, plus your riding style and the terrain, all influence the range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Batteries on electric bikes can give you a range of anything from 20 to 100 miles or more on a full charge, depending on their capacity (measured in watt-hours and abbreviated to Wh). Batteries are expensive, so an ebike with a longer range will, in general, cost more.</p>\n<p>You’ll usually get a battery-level indicator, while some control systems will give you an estimated range as you ride or regulate the power output to let you achieve your planned ride distance.</p>\n<p>Some ebikes let you plug in a second battery, which might fit in a bottle cage, to up range. You can also lower the assistance level during a ride to help conserve the battery and extend the bike’s range.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BMC Roadmachine AMP eBike\" title=\"BMC AMP launch and first ride - 16\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some batteries can be taken off the bike to charge.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While many brands will offer an estimated range for a particular model of bike, and it is possible to gauge a bike’s theoretical range based on its motor power and battery capacity, ultimately it depends on the level of assistance you’re using and the terrain.</p>\n<p>Fully recharging the battery from the mains can take anything from around three hours up to nine hours, or more depending on the model, charger and battery capacity.</p>\n<h2>What types of electric bike are there?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Electric hybrid bike\" title=\"Electric hybrid bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some hybrid bikes have a slanted top tube to make it easier to step on and off.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’ve got a separate guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike types</a>, but you can find almost any kind of bike with a motor.</p>\n<p>The most common types of electric bikes are hybrids and mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-hybrid-bikes/\">best electric hybrid bikes</a> have flat bars and chunky, puncture-resistant tyres, useful for biking to work, shopping and more leisurely rides.</p>\n<p>They may also have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> (or the eyelets to add full-length mudguards), a rack and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">lights</a>, and sometimes have a step-through frame design to make it easier to hop on and off the bike.</p>\n<p>Electric mountain bikes normally have a beefy motor with a high torque output to help you get up loose off-road climbs and over obstacles. Once you get to the top, the motor can be turned off to enjoy the downhill ride.</p>\n<p>There’s also a growing number of electric road bikes. With drop handlebars, they’re designed to ride fast and are usually relatively lightweight (as far as electric bikes go), to help with handling and hill climbing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Cairn Brave 1.0 gravel eBike\" title=\"Cairn Brave - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Electric gravel bikes are designed to be capable off-road and fast on tarmac.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s an increasing number of electric gravel bikes, too.
