Facebook was on the rise and Google was convinced the social network would soon swallow everything. To fight this blue scourge, then-Google CEO Larry Page <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-just-tied-employee-bonuses-to-the-success-of-the-googles-social-strategy-2011-4\">issued a decree</a> to his many employees: Your bonuses are now tied to Google's success in social! Build social features into everything! That memo resulted in a lot of ham-fisted social integrations across Google that were widely hated by the user base. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/google-officially-ends-forced-google-integration-first-up-youtube/\">YouTube comments</a> were tied to Google+, and the site was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/youtube-tries-to-stem-the-flow-of-a-new-kind-of-terrible-comments/\">flooded with spam</a>. Making a new Gmail address also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/google-nixes-g-requirement-for-gmail-accounts/\">required making</a> a Google+ account. Google Search got little \"+1\" buttons, and generally anonymous usage of Google products was impossible due to the \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/google-stops-forcing-all-users-to-use-their-real-names/\">real name</a>\" policy. And that's just the Google+ stuff—earlier this memo resulted in a social network being built into Gmail called \"Google Buzz\" that all users were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/3/#h3\">initially forced to join</a>.</p>\n<p>That forced integration strategy was an abject failure, and after a few years of Google's social panic, all of Google+'s integrations <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/google-officially-ends-forced-google-integration-first-up-youtube/\">were removed</a>, and the service was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-shuts-down-april-2-all-data-will-be-deleted/\">eventually shut down</a>. That past failure isn't stopping Google from pulling out that losing playbook for its next great panic: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-08/chatgpt-success-drives-google-to-put-ai-in-all-its-products\">Bloomberg's</a> Julia Love and Davey Alba are reporting that Google wants to build ChatGPT-style features into everything. According to the article, Google has issued \"a directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months.\"</p>\n<p>We wrote last month that Google's ChatGPT panic <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/it-sounds-like-google-will-unveil-its-chatgpt-clone-february-8/\">seemed a lot</a> like its response to Google+, and several employees relayed that same sentiment to Bloomberg. Just like with G+, the report added that \"current and former employees say at least some Googlers’ ratings and reviews will likely be influenced by their ability to integrate generative AI into their work.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922808#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922808&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed9d9f6133ee86a3fdc1736c054e205fb2293ef8df944ffe73f4b1","category":"Tech"}
