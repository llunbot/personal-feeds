It features 3D-printed gyroid-shaped infill padding that provides what Cadex touts as superior pressure distribution, smooth-riding compliance while reducing the weight to a vanishing 147g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1238\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gyroid-Structure-1.png\" alt=\"A rendering of the Cadex Amp 3Ds Gyroid padding structure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gyroid-Structure-1.png 1238w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gyroid-Structure-1-297x192.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gyroid-Structure-1-120x78.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gyroid-Structure-1-768x496.png 768w\" /><figcaption>Behold, the intelligently squishy and ultralight Gyroid!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Cadex, 3D-printed gyroid infill padding allows precise variation in density across the center of the saddle, optimizing support and comfort in key pressure zones while keeping weight to a minimum. Unlike traditional foam padding, the G3D padding actively adapts to rider movement for targeted support. Of course, the padding is only one part of what makes a saddle work. The base construction and of course, the shaping are equally key, and Cadex has focused intensely on these areas as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cadex claims that the Amp 3D’s pedaling efficiency is enhanced with a low-seated, Advanced Forged Composite base that minimizes flex. The rails are integrated with the base to eliminate traditional contact points, which helps relieve pressure and improves compliance. The combination of the G3D padding and integrated base also helps absorb vibrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"6878\" height=\"4386\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Maximum-Efficiency-1-jpg-e1744225875557.webp\" alt=\"A studio 3/4 shot of the Cadex Amp 3D\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Maximum-Efficiency-1-jpg-e1744225875557.webp 6878w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Maximum-Efficiency-1-jpg-e1744225875557-297x189.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Maximum-Efficiency-1-jpg-e1744225875557-1536x979.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Maximum-Efficiency-1-jpg-e1744225875557-120x77.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Maximum-Efficiency-1-jpg-e1744225875557-768x490.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Maximum-Efficiency-1-jpg-e1744225875557-2048x1306.webp 2048w\" /><figcaption>The shape and base construction of the AMP 3D also provide heaps of comfort and efficiency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Amp 3D represents the next evolution in saddle technology,” said Jeff Schneider, Global Head of Product for CADEX. “By integrating a high-resilience, 3D-printed gyroid structure with a precision-engineered carbon shell, we’ve created a saddle that dynamically adapts to the rider, minimizes weight, and maximizes power transfer without compromising comfort.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking beyond the padding material, the Amp is an effective short-nose cut-out saddle, featuring a crowned profile that drops away at the wings, resulting in increased pedaling space and a wider range of fit options. The truncated nose has smooth edges to minimize inner thigh interference and allow unrestricted movement for aggressive riding positions. The combination of these shaping elements ensures seamless power transfer without sacrificing stability. Compared to the existing Amp, the AMP 3D gains just 18g – a small penalty to pay for what should be a noticeable boost in compliance. For comparison, the S-Works Mirror 3D-printed saddle weighs in about 50g heavier than the Amp 3D. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1.webp\" alt=\"Ben O'Conner races through farmland on the Cadex Amp 3D saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pro-Tested-1-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>Ben O’Conner and other Jayco-Alula racers were involved in developing the Cadex Amp 3D saddle.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Be advised the Amp 3D is only available in 145mm width, and while this is going to work for much of the bell curve, saddle width can track with tire width, in that regardless of stature, many who experiment with wider saddles benefit from the added support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope to acquire a Cadex Amp 3D soon for some long-term testing, so stay tuned for more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.cadex-cycling.com/global\" target=\"_blank\">cadex-cycling.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cadex-amp-3d-saddle-gyroid-padding/\">Cadex unveils 147g Amp 3D saddle with Gyroid padding</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d5b386fe219adadb0b649b54bb8d65749b7ee6141d1254863a95d5bfa102c836","category":"Cycling"}
