Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke about how the Vision Pro ushers in “the beginning of a new era for computing”. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Vision Pro headset release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has said that the Vision Pro headset will be available “early next year” so a spring 2024 release date looks likely. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Vision Pro headset price </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has confirmed that the Vision Pro will start at $3,499. There will be an additional cost associated with any prescription lenses that are required, but we don’t yet know what that will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Vision Pro design </h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-design.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Vision Pro design\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-design.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-design.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-design.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-design.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has picked the materials that the Apple Vision Pro is made from to make it as “wearable” as possible. A custom aluminum alloy frame curves around the user’s face and a modular design means if can be tailored to fit the user “perfectly”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Light Seal is made of a soft textile that comes in a variety of sizes and shapes to suit the user’s face for a precise fit. There are flexible straps that can be adjusted to fit the head and ensure that the Audio Pods are positioned near the ears. The cushioned Head Band is available in multiple sizes and can be changed for another size or style. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about those who wear glasses? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who need glasses will be able to get custom optical inserts to correct their vision. These ZEISS Optical Inserts are sold separately, so if you require this upgrade expect to pay more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Vision Pro specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro will, according to Apple, “deliver phenomenal compute performance.” It is built on the M2 chip and the R1 chip. The R1 chip is used to process input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones, it also eliminates lag to avoid latency. Apple says it can update images at eight times faster than the blink of an eye. The headset “runs virtually silent”, according to Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ultra-high-resolution displays that combine to produce 23 million pixels and create a 4K display for each that could generate a display that appears to be 100 feet wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video can be rendered at 4K resolution and text appears sharp from any angle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod that can deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user’s own head and ear geometry. As a result, sound feels like it is coming from the space around you. Vision Pro also matches the sound to the room using audio raytracing. There’s also an advance sensor array. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the lenses a high-performance eye tracking system uses cameras and a ring of LEDs to project invisible light patterns on t the users eyes, as a result the Apple headset is able to tell what way the user is looking and use high performance eye tracking control the interface. Apple claims this is: “So precise it frees up your hands.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro also recognises the user’s iris as a method to unlock the device. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Vision Pro battery life </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple claims that the Apple Vision Pro can achieve all-day use when plugged in. You can expect up to two hours of use via its external, high-performance battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>visionOS software and apps</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Vision-Pro-apps-interface.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Vision Pro Apps interface\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Vision-Pro-apps-interface.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Vision-Pro-apps-interface.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Vision-Pro-apps-interface.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Vision-Pro-apps-interface.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Vision Pro headset users will be able to watch a movie, listen to music, browse photos, look at 3D objects, and even collaborate on a presentation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro headset will run visionOS, an operating system that Apple has designed from the ground up for vision computing. Developers will be able to use use familiar tools to create apps for this platform, according to Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be an App Store via which users will be able to download familiar iPhone and iPad apps as well as new apps designed for Vision Pro. Apple says that there will be lots of apps available at launch, including: Microsoft Office Apps, third party video conferencing apps, and Adobe Lightroom. Apple also previewed a SkyGuide app that can “transfer” you to space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple says that Vision Pro “Makes new types of games possible”. Apparently users will be able to play over 100 Apple Arcade games on a screen as large as they want with support for popular game controllers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will also be a number of well known Apple apps available at launch, such as Safari, Messages, and FaceTime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the apps you can expect to see: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Video Conferencing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>FaceTime will be available for the Vision Pro and will be able to take advantage of the room around you so that you can see everyone you are talking to in life size tiles. The participant’s voice will also comes from the direction of their tile thanks to Spatial Audio. Users wearing Vision Pro during a FaceTime call are reflected as a Persona — a digital representation of themselves created using Apple’s most advanced machine learning techniques. reflects face and hand movements in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has created a novel solution to the fact that you have a mask on and don’t have a camera in front of you. It can show a “persona”–a digital representation of you–that is based on your appearance. It can even show your hand movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Vision Pro features </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the new features are unique to this brand new device, such as:  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spacial Videos and Photos </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most impressive features is the ability to take photos and videos with the Vision Pro and them  later look back at them as part of an immersive, 3D experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is thanks to Apple’s first three-dimensional camera. Apple Immersive Video offers 180-degree high-resolution recordings with Spatial Audio. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Eye Sight </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This nifty features projects the correct perspective of your eyes to the people looking at you. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eye-Sight-Apple-Reality-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Reality Pro Eye Sight\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eye-Sight-Apple-Reality-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eye-Sight-Apple-Reality-Pro.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eye-Sight-Apple-Reality-Pro.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eye-Sight-Apple-Reality-Pro.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spacial Cinema </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the ultimate cinema experience, the screen can be adjusted to the perfect size and you can be surrounded with spacial audio. This way you can focus fully on the movie. Apple says users will be able to watch 3D movies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disney’s Bob Iger CEO of Disney joined Apple on stage to demonstrate his excitement about the new technology. Iger said: “Apple Vision Pro can make our vision a reality” and explained that it will “Bring Disney to our fans in ways we previously didn’t think possible”. Apple and Disney are partnering to make Disney Plus available for Vision Pro on day one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple says there will be an “exciting lineup of immersive videos” at launch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What the Vision Pro is like to use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now we can only repeat what Apple has said about the experience of using a Vision Pro, but as soon as we get our hands on one we will update this section!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple says that the Vision Pro input system is controlled by a person’s eyes, hands, and voice. But it  seems that the real control happens with your eyes. The Vision Pro being able to detect exactly where you are looking. As a result, users can browse through apps by simply looking at them, tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using voice to dictate. You can just look at a text input and begin dictating, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first put on Vision Pro you see your surroundings. You can freely move apps to fill the space around you and they can expend into your space. Apple says you can control how immersed you are Vision Pro with twist of the Digital Crown. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple described one design goal of Vision Pro as being to be “Never isolated from the people around you”. It achieves this in various ways, one is by displaying your eyes when there is someone near you. This is called EyeSight and it is designed to send a clear signal to people that you can’t see them when that is the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, if someone is near by they will appear in your view. This way it should still be easy to interact with the world around you while wearing the headset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A user can bring Mac wirelessly into Apple Vision Pro just by looking at it. The contents of the Mac screen are then brought on to the 4K display you see through the Vision Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An advanced Spatial Audio system is core to the Apple Vision Pro experience, creating the feeling that sounds are coming from the environment around the user and matching the sound to the space, according to Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro will work seamlessly with familiar Bluetooth accessories, according to Apple.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When viewing Photos users can access their entire photo library on iCloud. Every Panorama shot on iPhone expands and wraps around the user, according to Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does AR/VR mean? </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>VR = Virtual Reality (completely replaces your view)</li><li>AR = Augmented Reality (overlays real world with graphics and information)</li><li>MR = Mixed Reality (combining AR and VR) </li><li>XR = Extended Reality (combining AR, VR and MR)</li></ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/apple-ar-glasses-patent-illo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple AR glasses patent illustration\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/apple-ar-glasses-patent-illo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/apple-ar-glasses-patent-illo.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/apple-ar-glasses-patent-illo.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/apple-ar-glasses-patent-illo.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption>An early Apple Patent</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apps and software can we expect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, every app that comes pre-installed on an iPhone/iPad is going to get a custom app for the Reality Pro, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Books</li><li>Calendars</li><li>Camera</li><li>Contacts</li><li>FaceTime – create a digital avatar and meet other users in a virtual meeting room.</li><li>Fitness – watch a fitness instructor in VR while you work out in a virtual location (might be difficult to work out wearing a headset).</li><li>Files</li><li>Freeform</li><li>GarageBand</li><li>Home</li><li>iMovie</li><li>Keynote</li><li>Mail</li><li>Maps</li><li>Messaging</li><li>Notes</li><li>Pages</li><li>Photos</li><li>Reminders</li><li>Music</li><li>News</li><li>Numbers</li><li>Safari</li><li>Stocks</li><li>TV – allowing users to view video content in a ‘virtual theater’ or other virtual settings like the desert or moon.</li><li>Weather</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple headset: Problems and prohibitions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any of the following conditions you may not be able to use an Apple headset. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>If you’re prone to inner ear infections, have ADHD/ADD, anxiety disorders, a pacemaker, epilepsy, blackouts/seizures or are pregnant, you may be warned against using the headset.
