And sure enough, iOS 15.2 began its beta test period just a day after iOS 15.1 was released on October 25, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is typical of these releases, it is first available only to registered developers. The public beta typically follows within a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 11/10/21:</strong> iOS 15.2 beta 2 brings Communication Safety in Messages feature for parental controls, Legacy Contact, new Find My features and more. The public beta typically follows within a day.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New features in iOS 15.2</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>App Privacy Report</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15_2-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s release notes</a>, iOS 15.2 brings the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">App Privacy Report</a>, which is basically a new interface for the <em>Record App Activity</em> feature.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ios-15-app-privacy-report.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>The App Privacy Report in iOS 15 offers a detailed view of how apps are using your data and sensors.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Communication Safety feature in Messages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the release of iOS 15, Apple announced a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/352875/ios-15-csam-scanning-icloud-photos-messages-siri-search-faq.html\">CSAM feature</a> to detect child sexual abuse and trafficking in iCloud photos. It also announced a new parental controls feature for Messages, whereby a parent can enable a feature for their child’s phone to warn them if adult content is shared in Messages. This is separate from the CSAM scanning and has to be enabled in parental controls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iOS 15.2 update, Apple is making the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/550998/ios-15-2-conversation-safety.html\">Messages child safety parental control</a> available, but it has not yet rolled out the iCloud Photos CSAM feature. Apple said it will delay the launch of that feature while it re-works it to address complaints from privacy advocates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Legacy Contact</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Legacy Contact feature appears first in iOS 15.2 beta 2. It allows you to designate someone who can access your iCloud data in the event that you pass away. You can access it by opening <em>Settings</em>, choosing your <em>Apple ID</em>, then <em>Password &amp; Security</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find My: Items That Can Track Me</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has added a new feature to the Find My app (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via Macrumors</a>) that lets people search for a nearby AirTag or other Find My item that may be surreptitiously being used to track your location. When the option in <em>Items</em> is tapped, it scans for unknown Find My items.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sidebar and Store for the TV app (iPad)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the iPad, iPadOS 15.2 replaces the tab bar at the bottom of the screen with a sidebar. The tab bar includes a new section, Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hide My Email in Mail app (iCloud+)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tap the From label in an outgoing mail in the Mail app to see a Hide My Email option.
