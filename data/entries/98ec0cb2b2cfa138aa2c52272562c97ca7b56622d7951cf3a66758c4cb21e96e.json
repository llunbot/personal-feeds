These models, while not yet perfect, can generate new videos from text descriptions called prompts, still images, or existing videos. After OpenAI made waves with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/\">Sora</a> in February, two major AI models emerged from China: Kuaishou Technology's <a href=\"https://kling.kuaishou.com/\">Kling</a> and Minimax's video-01.</p>\n<p>Both Chinese models have already powered numerous viral AI-generated video projects, accelerating meme culture in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/\">weird new ways</a>, including a recent shot-for-shot translation of the <a href=\"https://x.com/PJaccetturo/status/1843737222031519910\"><em>Princess Mononoke</em> trailer</a> using Kling that inspired death threats and a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GordonRamsay/comments/1fxazzs/gordon_ramsay_ai/\">series of videos</a> created with Minimax's platform. The videos show a synthesized version of TV chef Gordon Ramsay <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXh-tLmf7_M\">doing ridiculous things</a>.</p>\n<div><blockquote><p>After 22 million views and thousands of death threats, I felt like I needed to take this post down for my own mental health. <br />This trailer was an EXPERIMENT to show my 300 friends on X how far we've coming in 16 months.<br />I'm putting it back up to keep the conversation going. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9f5.png\" alt=\"ð§µ\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/tFpRPm9BMv\">pic.twitter.com/tFpRPm9BMv</a></p>— PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PJaccetturo/status/1843737222031519910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div>\n<p>Kling first emerged in June, and it can generate two minutes of 1080p HD video at 30 frames per second with a level of detail and coherency that some think surpasses Sora. It's currently only available to people with a Chinese telephone number, and we have not yet used it ourselves.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98ec0cb2b2cfa138aa2c52272562c97ca7b56622d7951cf3a66758c4cb21e96e","category":"Tech"}
