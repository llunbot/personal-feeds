And according to a new report, if you’re buying a new iPhone, you may be at an even higher risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/porch-pirates-att-iphone-fedex-279ff419\" target=\"_blank\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reports that thieves have begun targeting iPhone deliveries across the U.S. by gaining access to AT&amp;T tracking numbers. Since the carrier doesn’t generally require a signature for delivery, porch pirates can stake out homes and instantly grab the package before the homeowner is even aware it has been dropped off. The Journal says that some thieves are dressing up as delivery drivers themselves to allay any suspicion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For its part, AT&amp;T says it will “work as quickly as possible with the customer to make it right,” but has no plans to change its policy. It only requires a signature in high-theft markets, and if you don’t live in one, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. The company points out that in-store pickup is also an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple requires a signature for purchases through its store, but many other stores, including Amazon, don’t, even on large purchases like a MacBook. So if thieves are able to gain access to AT&amp;T tracking numbers, they can conceivably get other companies’ numbers as well. So if you don’t have a <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/2163274/yale-smart-delivery-box-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">drop box</a> or some other way to secure your deliveries, you’ll definitely want to be a little more vigilant when waiting for packages to arrive this season.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"674af2809f6e820e4f4247526393ff5a5d837e7e3232c13fc2d1fa7bdedc3125","category":"Apple"}
