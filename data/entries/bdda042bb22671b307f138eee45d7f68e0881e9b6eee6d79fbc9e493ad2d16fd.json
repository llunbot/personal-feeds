Starliner's flight software disabled the five control jets when they started overheating and losing thrust. Four of the thrusters were later recovered, although some couldn't reach their full power levels as Starliner came in for docking. In mid-June, the Starliner astronauts hot-fired the thrusters again, and their thrust levels were closer to normal.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036270#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036270&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bdda042bb22671b307f138eee45d7f68e0881e9b6eee6d79fbc9e493ad2d16fd","category":"Tech"}
