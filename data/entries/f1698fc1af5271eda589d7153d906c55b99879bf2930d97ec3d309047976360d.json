I’ll repeat myself here, there was too much for one guy to cover. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, let me share one bike maker that was displaying a bike that I could really see myself enjoying. I mean, I really liked this next bicycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bender Bicycles was displaying a bike that caught my eye while wandering the show. It had a simple, useful elegance to it that was very attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stopped and talked to William Bender, and he was kind enough to remove his bike from the fixed display in his booth at the MADE Show so I could take it outside to snap some shots of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bender Bicycles’ Master of None</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bender Bicycles' Master of None at the booth\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bender-Bicycles-Master-of-None-at-the-booth.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

He calls it the Master of None. Now, I didn’t confirm with William, but I’m sure it’s a lighthearted jab at the fact that the bike is adaptable and versatile, you know… like a “jack of all trades and a master of none.”
