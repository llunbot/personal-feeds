These have the same size colour screen as the older Edge 530 and 830 units and as with the outgoing models, the higher-end 840 adds a touchscreen to the Edge 540’s button-only control. Both have a solar charging option. Garmin has also added climb profile support when riding unmapped routes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Edge 540 Solar is priced at £449.99 and the Edge 840 Solar costs £519.99. Forego solar charging and the respective prices are £349.99 and £449.99, a substantial jump from the older mid-range Edge computers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Solar charging is now an option</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506-970x732.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin Edge 840 bike computer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506-970x732.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506-300x227.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506-768x580.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506-1536x1160.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506-750x566.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506-1140x861.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-5-e1681207466506.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Garmin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline addition over the older Edge 530 and 830 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\">cycling computers</a> is optional solar charging, which was introduced by Garmin in its range-topping <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-edge-1040-solar-gps-bike-computer-review\">Edge 1040 Solar</a> and is also a feature of several of its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/fitness-tracker-guide\">smartwatches</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin says that this can increase battery life up to 60 hours if used in battery saver mode or 32 hours with heavier use. It claims that solar charging can add up to 25 minutes of extra charge per hour of use in the sunniest conditions, effectively almost doubling the battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a non-solar option for both computers, with Garmin claiming a 42-hour battery life in power saver mode and 26 hours with intensive use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On-the-fly climb profiles</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699-970x730.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin Edge 540 bike computer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699-970x730.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699-300x226.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699-768x578.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699-1536x1156.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699-750x564.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699-1140x858.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-1-e1681207556699.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Garmin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>New for the Edge 540 and 840, Garmin has replicated a major feature of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-2-review\">Hammerhead Karoo 2</a> with a new version of ClimbPro which gives you ascent profiles on the fly rather than only on pre-planned routes, as on its previous cycling computers. You can also search for climbs on the Edge or in the Garmin Connect smartphone app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On-the-fly climb profiles are a useful addition, which means that you can still track your progress on a climb even if you don’t want to plot out a route beforehand or if you deviate from a planned route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin has also trickled down many of the features of its top-end <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-edge-1040-solar-gps-bike-computer-review\">Edge 1040</a> cycling computer to the new Edge 540 and Edge 840 devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes a real-time estimate of stamina as you ride, helping you to track whether you can keep up the current pace for the duration of a pre-planned ride. You can also set up a power guide which, if you’re riding with a power meter, recommends power targets for each section of your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin claims increased positional accuracy from the new multi-band GNSS support, which again was first introduced in the Edge 1040. Multi-band GNSS is also found in the updated <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-elemnt-roam-review\">Wahoo Elemnt Roam</a> cycling computer, which carries the same price as the base model, non-solar Edge 540.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with its other Edge computers, Garmin has updated its maps as well, with ride-type-specific mapping and popularity-based routing as well as Trailforks integration. If you’ve been pestered by off-course notifications, you’ll be pleased to note that these can be paused on the new devices, then reinstated once you truly are lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plenty of functionality carried over</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"718\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283-970x718.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin Edge 840 bike computer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283-970x718.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283-300x222.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283-768x568.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283-1536x1137.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283-750x555.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283-1140x844.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-2-e1681207531283.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Garmin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Edge 540 and the Edge 840 both have a 2.6-inch colour display, which is the same size as the previous-generation Edge 530 and 830. As with Garmin’s previous generation models, the 5-series Edge is controlled using buttons only, while the 8-series computer adds a touchscreen.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features inherited from the last generation Edge computers include LiveTrack, group messaging and incident detection. You can also link up a rearview radar and lights and Garmin InReach devices, which give you satellite communications when out of range of mobile coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"708\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153-970x708.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin Edge 840 bike computer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153-970x708.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153-300x219.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153-768x561.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153-1536x1121.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153-750x548.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153-1140x832.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-3-e1681207509153.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Garmin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect, there’s support for indoor riding as well as outdoor, with control for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/review/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\">smart trainers</a> via ANT+ and Bluetooth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features of the Garmin Edge 540 and 840 cycling computers include performance-based training metrics, to identify performance strengths and weaknesses. There are also in-built adaptive coaching and workout schedules for both indoor and outdoor training based on the user’s specific objectives and the demands of a planned event or ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can track your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vo2-max-what-is-it-what-does-it-mean-can-you-improve-it\">VO2 max</a> if you ride with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-an-aid-to-better-training\">power meter</a> and get readouts of training load and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/the-cyclist-guide-to-good-recovery\">recovery time</a> among other metrics. There’s close integration with Garmin smartwatches, giving you a combined on- and off-bike view of your fitness and performance in Garmin Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Edge 540 and 840 pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SRP for the Garmin Edge 540 Solar is £449.99, or £349.99 for the non-solar unit. The Edge 840 Solar is priced at £519.99 or £449.99 in non-solar guise. Garmin is also selling the new Edge computers bundled with the usual array of sensors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s quite a jump from the prices of the Edge 530 and 830 which the new units replace, which cost £229.99 and £319.99 respectively. It still comfortably undercuts the larger format Edge 1040 Solar, which retails at £629.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our previous coverage of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/accessories/gps-bike-computers\">cycling computer</a> news</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/garmin-extends-solar-charging-to-its-new-mid-range-edge-540-and-840-cycling-computers\">Garmin extends solar charging to its new mid-range Edge 540 and 840 cycling computers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2e058b9c1205a290c107b00b6ce8c6af1beee158e004a2efb17e0b0d45bbc19e","category":"Cycling"}
