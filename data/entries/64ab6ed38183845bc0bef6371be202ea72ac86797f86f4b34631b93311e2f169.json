While the iOS and Android store switched over from Twitter to X very quickly, over on the Mac, the Twitter app was still available for download and mostly worked–some features, including search, were wonky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears the end is near. As of this week, searching for the Twitter app returns Telegram and a bunch of third-party apps that don’t work anymore. There’s also no X app and it’s doubtful there ever will be since the X team seemingly wasn’t aware the Twitter Mac app existed until very recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is some good news: if you already have the Twitter app installed on your Mac, it still works, though for how long is the question. The X team can turn off access at any point, which would force Mac users to use X on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it to X  (or, as the media calls it, “X formerly Twitter”) in July 2023. However, despite changing most Twitter references and apps to the X brand, the Mac app still has the old logo and name. Now it’s just a matter of time before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"64ab6ed38183845bc0bef6371be202ea72ac86797f86f4b34631b93311e2f169","category":"Apple"}
