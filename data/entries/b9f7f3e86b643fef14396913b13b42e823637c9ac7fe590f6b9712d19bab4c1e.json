SpaceX denied the hiring discrimination claims and alleged that the DOJ's administrative process for handling the discrimination complaint is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department filed an administrative complaint <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring\">against SpaceX on August 24</a> alleging that from at least September 2018 to at least May 2022, Elon Musk's space company \"discriminated against asylees and refugees throughout its hiring process, including during recruiting, screening, and selection, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"</p>\n<p>The DOJ suit alleged that \"asylees and refugees had virtually no chance of being fairly considered for or hired for a job at SpaceX.\" The DOJ complaint was filed through its own <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/eoir/office-of-the-chief-administrative-hearing-officer\">administrative hearing office</a> in which cases are heard by administrative law judges. SpaceX is trying to stop that process by filing a lawsuit in US District Court for the Southern District of Texas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969341#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969341&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9f7f3e86b643fef14396913b13b42e823637c9ac7fe590f6b9712d19bab4c1e","category":"Tech"}
