Over 200 rainbow jerseys were awarded across 11 days that brought almost every cycling discipline to Scotland, with blood, sweat and tears shed. Some by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m feeling slightly lost without daily cycling on my screen. To make up for it, here are five of my highlights from the UCI Cycling World Championships, including an ode to stuffed cows. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. A protest, a broken shoe, gold medals for two</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-970x646.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230806_164033950_iOS.jpg 1890w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The elite road races for the men and women provided some of the most thrilling action, albeit in two entirely different ways. The men’s road race was neutralised for almost 50 minutes due to protesters on the road. They were revealed to be from eco-protester group This is Rigged and you can catch a more in-depth discussion about it from me <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@robyn.emz/video/7264288670071459105?_r=1&amp;_t=8erRfOQmTuz\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The race eventually restarted and made its way to the Glasgow city circuit, where a relentless pace left many breathless. The ferocity was unhinged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the number of laps of the city circuit notched up and many a glance to rivals was exchanged, Italy’s Alberto Bettiol attacked. Ironically as the clouds overhead dumped rain against the occasional sunshine, a rainbow appeared over the field. Not like they needed a reminder of what they were fighting for. Unfortunately for Bettiol, who looked incredibly strong, cycling’s Avengers of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/trek-madone-2023-mads-pedersen\" target=\"_blank\">Mads Pedersen</a> formed behind to chase him down. The winning move of the day came from Van der Poel, who launched his attack past Bettiol into the final 22km. No one could catch him. </p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But just to add some drama, Van der Poel crashed into a bend and broke the Boa dial on his shoe, ripping his skinsuit and bloodying his knee. No matter, as he would still cross the line to win the rainbow jersey and become the first Dutch winner in almost 40 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"589\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230813_161036820_iOS-970x589.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230813_161036820_iOS-970x589.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230813_161036820_iOS-300x182.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230813_161036820_iOS-768x467.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230813_161036820_iOS-750x456.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230813_161036820_iOS-1140x693.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/20230813_161036820_iOS.jpg 1417w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The final day of racing hosted the elite women’s road race. As always, the Dutch took to the start line with a strong team including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2023-tour-de-france-femmes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes </a>champion Demi Vollering and Annemiek van Vleuten, who would be participating in her final World Championships before retirement (please reconsider). After an extraordinary performance to finish second overall at the Tour de France Femmes and having already won two world titles on the track during the week, eyes were understandably on Lotte Kopecky, who distanced Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig with just under 7km remaining. Uttrup Ludwig was unable to keep up with the relentlessness of Kopecky over Montrose Street, who then soloed to victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky had sadly lost her brother just before winning Nokere Koerse in March this year. After becoming the road race world champion, she said: ‘It’s already been an amazing year but also a very hard year. I don’t know what keeps me pushing… I don’t know what I was thinking. It really means a lot to me. It’s a dream come true.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podium, her Belgian teammates lifted her up in celebration in a scene of so much love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Josh Tarling’s time-trial</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Josh-Tarling-wins-elite-mens-time-trial-bronze-at-wold-c-hampionships-by-DAVID-PINTENS-of-BELGA-MAG-AFP-via-Getty-Images-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Josh Tarling wins bronze for the elite men’s time-trial race </figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remaining on the road, I cannot overstate how impressed I was with Josh Tarling’s performance during the men’s individual time-trial. 19-year-old Tarling, who only turned pro with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> at the beginning of the year and recently became the youngest British men’s elite time-trial champion, turned down riding in the U23 men category as it felt ‘unfair’ due to the level of support received from trade team Ineos Grenadiers. It couldn’t have gone any better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A time of 56min 07.43sec meant Tarling sat in the hotseat as provisional leader. He watched while big names such as Wout van Aert tried and failed to best his time. Italy’s Filippo Ganna would finally bump Tarling off the top spot but Belgium’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> would then win the rainbow jersey with an even faster time of 55min 19.23sec, becoming the youngest ever winner. These youngsters.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finishing 48 seconds behind Evenepoel, Tarling’s bronze medal further cements his already-built status as not only a future star, but a rider to watch now. He said: ‘I just tried to do my ride and if I get a medal, I get a medal. I feel like if I think about the medals I’d get too stressed and mess it up so it’s just a good bonus.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Jenny Holl and Sophie Unwin: The dynamite duo</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Jenny-Holl-and-Sophie-Unwin-win-gold-in-the-womens-B-para-cycling-Sprint-Finals-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Sophie Unwin and pilot Jenny Holl win gold in the Women’s B Para-Cycling Sprint Finals</figcaption><figcaption>Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been itching to write something about Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl. Holl is the track pilot for para-cyclist Unwin, who is visually impaired. Starting strong on the very first day, the pair won the Women’s B 1km Time-Trial by 0.006sec over Australia, later victorious in the Women’s B Individual Pursuit and Women’s B Sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their medal haul didn’t end there, taking home a silver in the Time-Trial and bronze for the Women’s B Road Race. Legend has it that even with no races on, they’re still winning medals. That same sentiment applies to Frances Brown, the most decorated athlete of the World Championships with five golds and one silver medal for para-cycling track and road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be remiss of me to speak about track cycling and not mention Katie Archibald. To experience such tragic loss with the death of her partner Rab Wardell last year is devastating and seeing her on the track brought emotions to the fore. Archibald just missed out on an omnium medal but was part of the phenomenal women’s team pursuit squad that won gold against New Zealand. She’s an inspiration and I continue to wish her the absolute best.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. MTB Downhill is wild and I love it</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Charlie-Hatton-gold-MTB-Downhill-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlie Hatton is congratulated by friends after winning MTB Downhill gold.</figcaption><figcaption>Andy Buchanan/AFP via Getty Images </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hadn’t had the opportunity to fully immerse myself in MTB Downhill before. Let me just say this: I’m hooked. This daredevil adrenaline-filled discipline has riders plummeting down the 2.8km technical terrain at speeds up to 80kmh, navigating drops, rocks and other obstacles against the clock.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The action took place in Fort William. Great Britain’s Charlie Hatton became the World Champion to rapturous applause and was mobbed in celebration by riders thrilled at his achievement. He had finished just 0.6sec in front of Atherton teammate Andreas Kolb as fellow British rider, Laurie Greenland, won bronze. I absolutely loved the camaraderie between competitors and can’t wait to catch more downhill action.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycle-ball\">Where cycling meets football: Inside the world of Cycle-Ball</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-worlds-what-to-watch\">Glasgow World Champs: 9 weird and wonderful events you need to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>5.

The adorable highland cow fluffy toys were presented to medal winners on the podium and quickly gained attention online, flying off online shelves and into the arms of many at home as collector’s items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being sold out, a further 3,000 were available to purchase and yes, I can confirm one will be making its way to me in November. Just in time for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first UCI Cycling World Championships did not disappoint. It was a sensational 11 days of racing, and I appreciate all the effort that goes into pulling off such a feat. I’m already planning for the 2027 event in Haute-Savoie. The athletic feats on display were remarkable but I’m going to leave you with a touch of relatability from Tom Pidcock before winning MTB XCO gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>I guess that’s what happens for getting out the Yorkshire flag in Scotland <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png\" alt=\"🤷‍♂️\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png\" alt=\"😂\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GlasgowScotland2023?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#GlasgowScotland2023</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerOfTheBike?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#PowerOfTheBike</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NvBSjhfvVN\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/NvBSjhfvVN</a></p>— 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships (@CyclingWorlds) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CyclingWorlds/status/1690392601453613057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">August 12, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-world-championships-2023-highlights\">Pro Log: 5 things to remember from the 2023 UCI World Championships</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ef33628fcc418c63a358e5dc5137d2659d7dde8a2c9b146402d508ee3dd41e81","category":"Cycling"}
