While the survey doesn't guarantee funding, it's highly influential with NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), which fund most of the astronomy research in the US.</p>\n<p>The latest iteration lays out a few scientific priorities, including the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies and exosolar systems. And it also suggests which hardware would be required to get the data we need for those studies. In this case, that involves the next of NASA's Great Observatories: a Webb-scale space telescope that is sensitive to wavelengths from UV to infrared.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the survey warns that funding for existing activities has become a bit unbalanced and needs to be reprioritized.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810433#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810433&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2637a83ae7bd01fcd3c01b92a782f5f6a2e7c26d5b49007525e2a07908db348c","category":"Tech"}
