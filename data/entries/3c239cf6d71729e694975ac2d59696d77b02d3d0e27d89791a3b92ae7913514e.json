The launch of a major new device and operating system, something that has not occurred since the debut of the original Apple Watch in September 2014, would certainly seem to justify the start of a new era for the company.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>A new era begins.

Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> referred to the \"beginning of a new era for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>\" upon announcing the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> in October 2020, but the company seldom makes such bold statements ahead of events, especially for WWDC. Earlier today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/several-new-macs-in-one-of-longest-ever-keynotes/\">Mark Gurman said</a> that he expects the keynote \"to be one of Apple's longest ever and easily exceed two hours.\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/apple-teases-new-era-at-wwdc/\">Apple Teases Dawn of a 'New Era' and Coding 'New Worlds' at WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-teases-dawn-of-a-new-era-and-coding-new-worlds-at-wwdc.2391090/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c239cf6d71729e694975ac2d59696d77b02d3d0e27d89791a3b92ae7913514e","category":"Apple"}
