The iOS Mail app has options for toggling off Contact <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> and Group by Sender for a look that's more like the iOS 17 Mail app, and there are some minor changes to how <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a> info is displayed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe software likely focuses on bug fixes and security improvements that are not outward facing.
