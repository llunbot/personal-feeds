If you were ever slightly suspicious as to whether companies actually sold their five-digit hero bikes – and indeed to whom, and where they got ridden – your answer is on this island. And yet for the most part, the riders who come here tend to tick off the same two climbs, Sa Calobra and Cap de Formentor, before packing their Bike Box Alans onto the next flight home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, those climbs are <em>stunning</em> with a capital S-bend, so much so that if you only had a single cycling day left on Earth you might well choose one of them to ride. But I’ve been assured that if I do have a little more time on both island and mortal coil, and I fancy putting some clear air between myself and everyone else, then today’s Big Ride is the hidden gem I’ve been looking for.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cap-de-formentor-cycling\">Classic climb: Cap de Formentor, a bucket list climb</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sa-calobra-cycling\">Classic Climb: Sa Calobra, the Strava KOM everyone wants</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sa-calobra-mallorca-cycling\">Big Ride: Chasing perfection on Sa Calobra</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cap-de-formentor-mallorca-cycling\">Big Ride: Cap de Formentor, Mallorca’s finest road</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Beach combing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We strike out from Esporles, and a boulevard that’s quintessential Mallorca: houses built from the island’s <em>marés</em> sandstone glow behind leafy planes, the early sun conjuring a dreamy light you could almost inhale.

It’s the kind of place where you just want to sit down with the old men in flat caps and play dominoes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Riding out of Esporles in northwest Mallorca, past St Pedro’s church and on to the Coll de sa Bastida.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Today’s plan is to hit four beaches, the first three diminutive and lesser-known, the fourth the mighty Port de Sóller, which along with Port de Pollença and where we’re staying at the Zafiro Palace in Alcuida are among the more popular spots on the island. Owen seems excited by the prospect of these first three, explaining that he rarely ventures this far west. As a ride guide for tour operator Ciclos Major, his clients tend to come for those big scalps in the north and east.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Climbing back up from Cala Banyalbufar, our first beach of the day.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It rings true. We’ve been riding for half an hour and we’ve not seen another soul, least of all on a bike. Almost unheard of for a place that welcomes 200,000 cyclists annually – more than a fifth of Mallorca’s population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road climbs steadily until we’re finally transposed onto a corniche of crisp tarmac scribing the edge of the cliffs. Views twist and plummet seawards, the road cutting in and out of thick forest, and there’s a distinct lack of agreement between my computer screen and the sensation of height. We’re little more than 450m up, apparently, yet when the road swoops down it feels like we’re falling from an aeroplane.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I slow up to take a hard right but Owen shouts to keep going – we’ll come back to this turn later; first we must drop into the beach at Cala Banyalbufar, then ride the same road back out again, the Coll de sa Bastida.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Words and numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inuits have 52 words to describe snow, and as we descend it occurs to me cyclists should have more for roads. We spend enough time discussing them yet right now I can’t do much better than ‘wide’, ‘smooth’ and ‘tarmac’. Also add ‘glorious’.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Given these descriptors, our progress to sea level is rapid, aided by eerily quiet surroundings and an ever-sharpening gradient. By the time we’ve reached the beach we’ve encountered one car – notable for the tannoy on its roof playing a strange, piccolo-based tune – and have lost 300m in a little over 4km.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>High above the sea on the Ma-10, en route to the Coll d’en Claret.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>If the last few streets to the beach are steep to go down it’s nothing compared to how steep they are going back up: 20, 22 and 24% come and go, accompanied by the haunting melody of the car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon exiting Banyalbufar village it becomes clear the vehicle’s occupants are something akin to ‘knockers’, those folk who knocked on the doors of 1980s Britain selling cleaning products.

At a shade over 500m, this is one of the middling peaks in the Serra de Tramuntana, which run down Mallorca’s northwest. It’s rideable from multiple directions, including Esporles. From there, the Coll d’en Claret is 13km at 3%, but from Port des Canonge the average gradient doubles. Despite this, Owen is able to talk freely, while I’m able to complete most of a sentence before gasping for breath. I take comfort in the fact he is 15kg lighter, 15 years younger and has a moustache, which I’m told is fashionable among the young as well as working like a trip-strip for smoother laminar airflow.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption> The beach at Port des Canonge.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>If below was like an evacuated town, the top of the Coll d’en Claret is a comparative Piccadilly Circus.

Nine hairpins and two burning quads later we’ve resumed our perch at 500m, the road to Valldemossa returning to its hiding place in the pines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bohemian rhapsody</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A gentle, undulating road carries us through Mirador and on to Deià, the stomping ground of artists and celebs down the years from Hendrix and Jagger to Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. <em>The Darling Buds Of May</em>, what a show.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-11.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The Port de Valldemossa climb winds its way through thick forest.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We stop to peer into the house-turned-museum of celebrated English poet Robert Graves. I confess to Owen I have no idea who Robert Graves is, save for having just learned that he is a celebrated English poet from the plaque outside. Still, I get the appeal of Deià. Terracotta roofs dot themselves among the poplars and olive groves, the backdrop a competition between sea and sky as to which can be the bluest. We’re not alone in our seduction – Deià is evidently a tourist trap, so I’m glad enough when we drift away on the comforting metronomics of our freewheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while we descend in peace, but as we near our last sea-level visit of the day we find ourselves in a traffic jam. Sóller and its port are two of the most popular and populous parts of the island, which is a shame as this road would clearly be something of a rollercoaster otherwise.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-12.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Passing through Deià, one of Mallorca’s most visited towns.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When we arrive in Port de Sóller – all pretty beach, bougie restaurants and genteel wooden tram – I can imagine why this was quite the place in its 20th century heyday. Not to say it no longer is, but having come from where we’ve come from, Sóller’s busyness is overwhelming. Still, in another world, if this was the beginning and end of this ride, I think I’d find it very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Racing home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s sweet relief when we make the final turn across a main road and up onto the first hairpins of the Coll de Sóller. The tunnel built below now syphons traffic away, leaving the slopes of this climb devoid of motor vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resulting silence has a wintry softness to it, and down to a leaf, everything is still. We toil up and up, Owen at pains to tell me to watch the mossy edges of the hairpins, as much a product of the lack of car tyres as they are their positions in shadow. Sure enough, when I stand and push I feel my wheel slip.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-13.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>An aerial view of near the top of Coll de Sóller, as approached from Port de Sóller in the north.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Farm terraces ripple in topographical contours from a summit we can’t yet see, and by the time we reach the top a woman is already clearing away the plastic chairs of her cafe.

But tragedy struck twice in the 1930s – first in 1934 when José Nicolau, aka ‘The Canon of Llorito’, crashed and later died during a meet at the Tirador Velodrome; then in 1936 when a similar fate befell Rafael Pou. The first Mallorcan to finish the Vuelta a España and a huge track star, Pou crashed while training behind a derny on the same velodrome’s banks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such setbacks didn’t dampen the local enthusiasm for cycling, and Mallorca has since produced double Olympic gold track medallist Joan Llaneras (2000 and 2008), has hosted the Vuelta three times (1975, 1986, 1991) and as of 1992 has its own European-level races, today called the Challenge Vuelta Ciclista a Mallorca. But among amateur cyclists, arguably the biggest annual draw is the Mallorca 312, a 312km, 5,050m total elevation sportive circumnavigating the island. The next one is on 26th April.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 161 Mallorca\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/big-ride-161-mallorca-15.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The five-star Zafiro Palace in Alcudia is fully geared up for riding and relaxing in style.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fancy an adventure? Try driving to Mallorca – Eurotunnel, through France, Spain and then a ferry to the island. Easy. Not quite got the time? Wherever you are in the UK, a raft of year-round flights service the island. <em>Cyclist</em> flew from Bristol Airport for around £260 return with a bike bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at the five-star Zafiro Palace Hotel in Alcudia, whose all-day buffet is a godsend to any cyclist arriving bedraggled and sweaty and in need of immediate sustenance. The Zafiro also boasts a host of swimming pools, a huge and comprehensive bike workshop and bike hire space, and boasts an array of all-inclusive restaurants that are all genuinely superb. Prices from around £120pn. See <a href=\"https://www.zafirohotels.com/\" target=\"_blank\">zafirohotels.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mighty big thanks to Darryl and Liz, who run cycle guiding outfit Ciclos Major out of the Zafiro Palace Hotel, and their guide Owen. Darryl has been cycling and working on the island for years and there is no corner he doesn’t know, nor wouldn’t be prepared to show you, whether as part of a group or as a self-directed ride.
