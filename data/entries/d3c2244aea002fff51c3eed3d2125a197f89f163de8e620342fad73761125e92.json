{"title":"European Commission Designates iPadOS a DMA ‘Gatekeeping’ Platform Too","link":"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2363","date":1714429987000,"content":"\n<p>European Commission press release (italics added):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On 5 September 2023, the Commission designated Apple as a\ngatekeeper for its operating system iOS, its browser Safari and\nits App Store. On the same day, the Commission opened a market\ninvestigation to assess whether Apple’s iPadOS, <em>despite not\nmeeting the quantitative thresholds laid down in the DMA</em>,\nconstitutes an important gateway for business users to reach end\nusers and therefore should be designated as a gatekeeper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rules are what the EC commissioners decide they are, not what the DMA says. Among their reasons cited:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li><p>End users are locked-in to iPadOS. Apple leverages its large\necosystem to disincentivise end users from switching to other\noperating systems for tablets.</p></li>\n<li><p>Business users are locked-in to iPadOS because of its large and\ncommercially attractive user base, and its importance for certain\nuse cases, such as gaming apps.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The “lock-in” is basically just features exclusive to Apple’s own platforms. I’m not even sure how Apple could possibly create a platform without “lock-in”.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, iPadOS is clearly more of a marketing distinction than a technical one. It’s iOS under the hood, so I doubt it’ll be much trouble for Apple to apply its DMA compliance features from iOS to iPadOS. I would have been surprised if the EC had <em>not</em> decided to designate iPadOS a “gatekeeping” platform, and I’m guessing Apple itself is unsurprised as well.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/29/ec-ipad-gatekeeping-platform\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d3c2244aea002fff51c3eed3d2125a197f89f163de8e620342fad73761125e92","category":"Tech"}
