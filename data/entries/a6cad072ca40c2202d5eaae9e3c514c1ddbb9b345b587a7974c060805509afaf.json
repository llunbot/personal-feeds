{"title":"What's New With the Camera App in iOS 18","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-camera-app/","date":1726094198000,"content":"With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> update, Apple added new features to almost all of its built-in apps, including the Camera app. The ‌iOS 18‌ Camera app includes a few small but useful improvements for timed photos, portraits, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Camera-Closeup-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Timers</h2>\r<br />\nAlong with the existing 3-second and 10-second timers, there's now an added 5-second timer that provides more flexibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-camera-timer-5-seconds.jpg\" width=\"1890\" height=\"1063\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Flash Settings</h2>\r<br />\nFlash settings can be adjusted by touching and holding on the flash button in the Camera app. It brings up Auto, On, and Off options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-camera-flash-controls.jpg\" width=\"1852\" height=\"1042\" />\r<br />\nThese settings could be accessed in the flash options when tapping on the carrot to get to different photo controls, but a long press is quicker. A tap still turns flash off and on.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Music When Taking Photos and Videos</h2>\r<br />\nWhen you're taking a video music playing on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> will no longer be paused and will continue playing. In the Settings app, there's an \"Allow Audio Playback\" toggle that you can turn on that ensures music will continue playing on the ‌iPhone‌'s speaker when a video is recording.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/allow-audio-playback-camera-setting.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nIn prior versions of iOS, using the Camera app to capture video automatically paused any audio playing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also says that music will continue to play via Bluetooth connections when capturing a photo or video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Next-Generation Portrait Enhancements</h2>\r<br />\nOn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and later models, ‌iOS 18‌ adds Portrait Lighting controls and support for Night mode portraits when in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-next-generation-portraits.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nFor context, Apple last year added next-generation Portraits functionality that automatically captures portrait information when using the standard photo taking mode. Previously, you needed to use the specific Portrait mode to get a Portrait shot, but that's no longer the case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new feature lets you take a photo without changing modes, and then choose to add depth of field Portrait effects afterward.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nAdditional information on new features that Apple has added in ‌iOS 18‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">can be found in our iOS 18 roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-camera-app/\">What's New With the Camera App in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-new-with-the-camera-app-in-ios-18.2435943/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a6cad072ca40c2202d5eaae9e3c514c1ddbb9b345b587a7974c060805509afaf","category":"Apple"}
