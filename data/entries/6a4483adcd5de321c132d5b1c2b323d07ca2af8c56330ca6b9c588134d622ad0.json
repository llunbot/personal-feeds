It’s really only a cosmetic change that unifies the bicycle tool line-up globally and differentiates it from one of their biggest competitors. But it’s actually also a subtle shift to some more ergonomic dual-compound handles that they first developed <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unior-tool-spins-up-unique-hub-genie-pro-kit-travel-case-2-for-1-disc-tool-much-more/\">around six years ago</a> when they added red to their lineup for the North American market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unior Bike Tools get red handles round the world now!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Unior-Bike-Tools-Go-Red-Globally.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1079\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Unior-Bike-Tools-Go-Red-Globally.gif\" alt=\"Unior Bike Tools Go Red Globally\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unior may have been making handtools in-house in Europe in a signature light blue for <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unior-tool-celebrates-100-years-with-limited-edition-kit-many-new-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">more than a century</a>. But ever since they expanded more and spread deeper into the USA around 2017, they <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/made-in-europe-unior-euro-multi-tools-now-shipping/\" target=\"_blank\">added red-handled options</a> to avoid confusion with Park Tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes-800x288.jpg\" alt=\"Unior bike tools Master Kit for pro cycling mechanics - global blue or USA red\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes-800x288.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes-297x107.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes-120x43.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes-768x276.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes-1536x553.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Unior-bike-tools-Master-Kit-for-pro-cycling-mechanics_global-blue-and-USA-red-toolboxes-2048x737.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That red shift, also with the addition of orange accents, also was a point for Unior to update some of their simple hard plastic blue handles with newer dual-compound co-molded plastic+rubber ergonomic handles. Many of the newer blue tools share a similar blue &amp; gray grip. But now in the unifying color change, pretty much every one of the red bicycle hand tools gets the most ergonomic dual-compound handle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Unior Bike Tools add new bicycle repair toolkits, BMX Made For Work\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unior-Bike-Tools-add-new-bicycle-repair-toolkits_BMX-Made-For-Work.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, there is no technical or pricing change in any of the tools –  you get the same ‘Made For Work’ premium quality <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/factory-tour-unior-tools-part-1-bike-tools-born-european-forges/\" target=\"_blank\">manufactured in Slovenia</a>, in the EU, and with the same limited lifetime warranty.

Now the rest of the world can get them through their regular distribution channels, too. Interestingly, it looks like some blue-handled tools are now available in clearance sales direct from Unior, for anyone who wants to snatch some blue up before it is gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://uniorbiketools.com/\" target=\"_blank\">UniorBikeTools.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unior-bike-tools-go-red-globally-with-ergonomic-upgrades/\">Unior Bike Tools Go Red Globally, with Ergonomic Upgrades</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6a4483adcd5de321c132d5b1c2b323d07ca2af8c56330ca6b9c588134d622ad0","category":"Cycling"}
