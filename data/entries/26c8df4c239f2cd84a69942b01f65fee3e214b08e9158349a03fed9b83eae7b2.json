While Samsung Display will supply OLED screens for all four <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, LG Display will supply screens exclusively for the Pro models. Additionally, BOE is expected to help supply OLED displays for the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe development is particularly noteworthy for LG, which has historically struggled to meet Apple's production deadlines. Last year, LG Display received approval for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> OLED screens several months after Samsung Display, allowing Samsung to increase its market share and secure higher prices. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung Display is expected to undergo the approval process for the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max's OLED screens by the end of this month, with LG Display scheduled to follow in the middle of June. Currently, Samsung Display has received approval for the standard ‌iPhone 16‌ and the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌, with the Plus and Pro Max models soon to follow. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>The Elec</em> claims that differences between the OLED displays for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ are minimal, but the bezels <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/\">may be slightly thinner</a> thanks to Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology. The entire ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is expected to launch in the fall. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/iphone-16-pro-display-production-greenlit/\">Apple Green-Lights iPhone 16 Pro Display Production</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-green-lights-iphone-16-pro-display-production.2427561/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"26c8df4c239f2cd84a69942b01f65fee3e214b08e9158349a03fed9b83eae7b2","category":"Apple"}
