Now, it has brought the first battery electric pickup truck to market ahead of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/tesla-wants-to-reinvent-the-pickup-with-the-39900-cybertruck/\">electric vehicle giant Tesla</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/heres-what-we-know-about-fords-electric-f-150-lightning-pickup/\">just-plain-giant Ford</a>, and this vehicle is aimed at a distinct buyer when compared to the everyman F-150 Lightning or the Mars colonist's Cybertruck. The $67,500 R1T is for people who like exploring the outdoors—this is an adventure truck. And to put that claim to the test, last week we drove one up a mountain and back.</p>\n<p>Rivian got started in 2009 and toyed with the idea of a number of different vehicles until it settled on a pair of battery electric vehicles—a truck and SUV—to begin with. Both were to be built in a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, that the company bought in 2017. The following year, the company emerged from \"stealth mode,\" and in 2019, I got to check out the concept R1T at that year's New York auto show, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/these-are-the-best-new-vehicles-of-the-2019-new-york-international-auto-show/\">where it pushed all the right buttons</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798727#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798727&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
