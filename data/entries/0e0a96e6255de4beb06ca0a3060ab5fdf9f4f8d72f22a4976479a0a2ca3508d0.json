This year had some tasty newcomers to keep me fueled, along with all manner of gels, drinks, and snack foods, some weirder than others. And I tried all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above are several new flavors from vegan sports nutrition brand <a href=\"https://crankednaturals.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cranked Naturals</a>, inspired by popular Hispanic drinks. Look for Horchata, Tamarindo, and Jamaica (hu-my-ka, not the island of Jamaica), which sound perfect for hot summer rides.

It, too, claims to boost VO2 max with regular use, with general studies supporting such claims in addition to reduced inflammation. (They also make CBD and related products, including a very excellent chamois cream, and I <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-056-twisted-spoke-cbd-explains-everything-you-want-to-know-about-cbd/\">interviewed them for the podcast</a> about all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"floyds of leadville CBD gummies with electrolytes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/floyds-cotton-candy-red-raspberry-energy-chews.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of CBD, <a href=\"https://floydsofleadville.com\" target=\"_blank\">Floyd’s of Leadville</a> has new Cotton Candy and Red Raspberry flavors of the CBD gems, the difference between the two packages being black is Full Spectrum, and white is Isolate. They’re pretty much just gummies, no real electrolytes to speak of, but if you like sugar while you ride and you like CBD, well… it tastes like Cotton Candy, so what’s not to like?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"OSMO power fuel high carb drink mix\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osmo-power-fuel-endurance-drink-mix.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://osmonutrition.com/products/osmo-power-fuel\" target=\"_blank\">OMSO’s new Power Fuel</a> comes with or without caffeine and is a flavorless source of carbs that you add to any sports drink you want. Comprised mostly of clustered dextrin, a carbohydrate that packs more energy but empties through the stomach quickly so you can get more fuel into your system without upsetting your stomach. It also contains a bit of fructose and sodium, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve tried it on a few long rides now and it seems to work well, without getting overly thick or sticky or weird tasting like some other products I’ve tried with the same carb source.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"fluid whey protein isolate\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fluid-whey-protein-isolate-tactical-hydration-tablets-01.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://store.livefluid.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fluid</a> has just added a pure whey protein isolate product to their line, making it easy to add protein to shakes, smoothies, recovery drinks, etc. If you’ve tried upping your whey protein and been extra gassy, it’s probably because you cheaped out and bought whey protein concentrate. I’ve been there. It’s fun, but only for you, and only until it’s not. Whey Isolate doesn’t (usually) have the same hilarious side effects and it delivers more protein per gram, but it costs more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://store.livefluid.com/collections/tactical-1\" target=\"_blank\">Tactical</a> lineup is aimed at active folks (think firefighters, field workers, etc.) but not athletes specifically since they add Sucralose as the main sweetener, which makes them slightly more affordable than some other electrolyte tablets that use Stevia or other natural sweeteners.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"drop drop dehydration relief drink mix\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dripdrop-dehydration-relief-high-sodium-sports-drink.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dripdrop.com\" target=\"_blank\">DripDrop</a> makes high-electrolyte powders for rehydrating you, making them a good option for before or after really hot rides or really long nights.

Not chicken flavored, but actual chicken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were only sampling the Nashville Hot flavor, but the Chicken &amp; Waffles and Salt &amp; Vinegar would probably have been my preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink-800x302.jpg\" alt=\"laird hamilton daily greens health drink and boosted coffee creamers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink-800x302.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink-297x112.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink-768x290.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink-1536x580.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laird-coffee-creamer-daily-greens-drink.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Laird Superfoods gets a brand refresh for their Superfood Creamers (which are great), and they’ve added a new Daily Greens supplement. It’s exactly what you think it is, and if you’ve ever had Athletic Greens, it tastes kinda like that but less pineapple-y, and it’s more affordable. It comes in 30-serving bags and 15-pack single servings for about $2/serving.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"picky bars nut butter protein energy bars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picky-Bar-Nut-Butter-bars.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars\" target=\"_blank\">Picky Bars</a> are delicious, and their new(ish) Nut Butter Bars are more delicious. They make a great mid-ride snack, but are probably best stored in a top tube or handlebar bag, they won’t really get melty, but they might get a little soft in your jersey pocket on a hot day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"honey stinger oat and honey bars and caffeinated chews\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-stinger-oat-honey-bars-caffeinated-chews2.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite snack of the show was the new <a href=\"https://honeystinger.com\" target=\"_blank\">Honey Stinger</a> Oat + Honey bars. They have a nut butter center coated in crunchy oats and are freakin’ delicious. They also introduced their first caffeinated energy chews, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/best-day-brewing-NA-beer.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/best-day-brewing-NA-beer-800x1000.jpg\" alt=\"best day brewing non-alcoholic beers on ice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/best-day-brewing-NA-beer-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/best-day-brewing-NA-beer-240x300.jpg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/best-day-brewing-NA-beer-96x120.jpg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/best-day-brewing-NA-beer-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/best-day-brewing-NA-beer.jpg 1080w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shout out to <a href=\"https://bestdaybrewing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Best Day Brewing</a> for keeping everyone (and, seriously, I mean EVERYONE) hydrated with their delicious non-alcoholic beers all weekend. Every booth had some, and they kept the cooler full every time I walked by. Good stuff and highly recommend if you’re trying to cut back. I forgot to take a photo of their beer, so this one’s from their Instagram.
