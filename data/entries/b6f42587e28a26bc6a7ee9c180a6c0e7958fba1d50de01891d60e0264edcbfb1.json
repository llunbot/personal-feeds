At 1,560m above sea level this Swiss town is Europe’s highest, so little surprise it has two <em>hors catégorie</em> climbs on its doorstep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This June the Tour de Suisse will celebrate its 90th birthday by taking on one, the Albula Pass, but right now it’s the turn of the Haute Route Davos – the event that has brought me here – to make use of the other HC climb, the Flüela Pass, plus a whole lot more besides. Taking place over three days, Haute Route Davos will cover 265km and 6,750m of ascent. Hopefully I packed my climbing legs.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/switzerland-croix-de-coeur-cycling\">Switzerland’s gift to the Giro: Croix de Coeur Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-road-beyond-switzerland-big-ride\">The road beyond: Switzerland Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/scandi-noir-haute-route-norway-review\">Scandi noir: Haute Route Norway review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Colder still</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Full to the brim with carbs after last night’s pasta party and the continental breakfast this morning, I eye up my fellow riders. Most are drenched in Assos – we’re in Switzerland after all – most are men and, as I discover, most live in the Alps. This means they can’t help but offer some advice about the climbs we are going to face today: ‘The middle bit is the worst,’ I’m told in regard to the Albula, the first and longest climb. With this at the front of my mind, we roll up to the start line where to my great joy the organisers are handing out foil sheets.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There is cold and then there is late-September-Swiss-mountain-cold, so as someone who may have come slightly underprepared I proceed to shove these foil sheets around every possible part of my jacket. No sooner am I more robot than cyclist than the sound rings out of hundreds of riders clipping in, and we are off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first few kilometres are neutralised so we ride through the valley as a 250-strong peloton, searching out a sun that’s still hiding behind vast peaks. A throng of red flashing lights flickers ahead of me, while the whir of freehubs cuts through Davos’s early-morning silence. I feel comforted by the sight of numerous hands being jiggled about as others, like me, attempt to defrost their fingers. I’m not the only one who didn’t bring their winter gloves.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Police, medics, mechanics on motorbikes and cars laden with bicycles thunder past. I’m half expecting to see a TV crew and hear a helicopter overhead, but no sooner has my mind started to ponder the idea of being a pro cyclist than a chequered flag waves us on. This marks the beginning of the timed section, and with it comes a sneaky kick in the road. We’re soon climbing sharply, the blood really pumping and all notions of cold digits forgotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Head for heights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At around 30km the Albula Pass begins. Pushing 31km long, averaging 6.3% and rising to 2,315m it’s arduous, but that only leaves plenty of time to choose a small gear and strike up conversation with a nice lady from Colorado. We churn away together and she explains she has come all this way just to ride this event, but after a while it becomes clear her dream didn’t include going so slowly as to be able to take pictures of cows. She leaves me to my bovine portraiture and slogs off up the road.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A bitterly cold morning marks the start of Stage 1.</figcaption><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The sun is shining and the Albula’s first third passes quickly, but as I cycle through the beautiful town of Bergün that earlier piece of advice echoes in my mind. I stop at the next feed station, which to my delight has plenty of salty boiled potatoes on offer among other things, and I take a handful in preparation for said ‘middle part’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I set off in great spirits, the boiled potatoes and blue sky both key factors, and begin to climb once more. The gradient barely drops below 9% and, as I glance at my Garmin’s ClimbPro screen that analyses the road ahead, I see it shows no sign of relenting. I find my spirit waning and my legs burning.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mavic is on hand for any mechanical issues (and to help you feel like a pro).</figcaption><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>My frustration mounts as my computer refuses to acknowledge the (debatable) fact I am in a ‘red’ section of road, thus my effort feels too great, my digital achievement too little and my legs devastatingly lacklustre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the grumbling, this part of the pass is tremendously beautiful.

The Albula may well be the hardest and most majestic climb I have ever ridden, but the stage isn’t over yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Up and away</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back on the bike and thrilled to be going downhill, the route snakes to the foot of the Flüela Pass, passing through a long flat section where, to my great joy, a fellow rider and I chaingang our way over crystal blue rivers and luscious green fields.

Almost immediately a set of hairpins looms, which reignites the fire in my legs, and the grind begins again. I slither along the mountainside towards the summit, ramp after ramp after ramp, and it’s here where I begin to consider cycling as a purely sadistic sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I climb above the tree line, unenthused with this thought, albeit the final kilometres to the top are striking, with views over the aquamarine Lai de la Scotta and Lai Nair lakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The descent into Davos is steep and rather terrifying thanks to my state of exhaustion, but I plough on, powered by the prospect of a meal and a massage.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rising to 2,315m, the Albula Pass is one of the highest road passes in Switzerland and not for the faint-hearted.</figcaption><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Back at the hotel, a prize-giving follows each stage, along with a route briefing for the next day, and I’m struck by the calibre of some of the riders present. The likes of Team Amani’s Charles Kagimu and Salim Kipkemboi are here among us amateurs, as is professional ultracyclist Nathalie Baillon. We’re treated to a video recap of the day to relive our collective suffering and gritted teeth, and if like me you got interviewed at 7:30am, you get to relive that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Round two</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While yesterday was incredibly cold, today looks to be incredibly soggy, but the mood among the riders can best be described as ‘hungry’. Today’s second stage will finish in Partnun, which stands at a decent if not spectacular 1,785m, although our route to it packs plenty of steepness and zing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quaint town of Putz produces the first big punch, which while only 3km long manages to notch up a healthy 8.4% average gradient. This quickly thins out the peloton, sieving the racers from the rest – no bad thing given how the road narrows and the surface worsens.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Stage 2 features quaint villages, luscious green landscape and, yep, more climbing.</figcaption><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We pass through more chocolate-box villages before reaching the next sizeable climb, Fatans. At 6km it’s sneaky, because this is not a figure that conjures pulsating hearts or quad-crunching images, but within these six kilometres lies an 8% average with a 2km stretch at 12%. Plenty on offer to hurt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An abundance of warning signs now lines the road, alerting us to tractors and the potential to slip on grapes spilt after the late summer harvest, but luckily no one seems to have succumbed as yet to sliding on these wine-making marvels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final section comes in the form of our ascent to Partnun. At 20km long it proves another superb opportunity to soak up the natural beauty of this place – the Alpine backdrop, traditional Swiss houses and a 500-year-old church – and I’ve even been told we might see donkeys. But with beauty comes pain, and with the climb to Partnun comes two brutal ramps and zero donkeys, much to my disappointment. Cue pain faces all around.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>We begin to lament at the relentless ramps in the ‘middle part’ of the Albula climb.</figcaption><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The winding road leads to several switchbacks, and eventually Partnun. Unfortunately the weather isn’t playing ball, so I can only imagine how lusciously green and bucolic this place would be on a clear day. For now, I’m just happy to head to the hotel, where I’m pretty sure I won’t feature in today’s video recap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Grand finale</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Day three and the final stage – a 15km time-trial up the Flüela Pass, this time from the Davos side. Music blares and people cheer, the MC announcing each rider as they launch out of the block for one final showdown. Once again I’m struck by the event’s participants, who although numbering just 250 have come from all over the world. As I wait my turn I get chatting to race organiser Tristan Cousins, who says this year has seen riders from as far away as Nicaragua, Uganda and Brazil, plus of course from Colorado.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This year 12% are also female,’ he tells me. ‘It’s the best rate yet, but we need to look for ways to increase it. Toilets in feed stations and non-timed sections help I think. These things also bring that sense of family to the race.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>There’s nothing quite like the feeling of nearing the end of a Haute Route stage.</figcaption><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That family feel is certainly evident, and the long, untimed sections each day have helped foster a feeling more ride than race. I only wish there was more convivial untimed riding to be done. As it is, now it’s just me and the next 15km uphill, and my deathly hallowed legs are baulking at the prospect of pushing the pedals once again. Yet – and this has become a hallmark of Haute Route Davos – as punishing as the gradient is, the road is picturesque enough to more than compensate for the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pass the Maria zum Schnee chapel in Tschuggen, a well-known place of pilgrimage. Can’t imagine I’ll be hiking back up here this afternoon though. Then finally I arrive at the top to find dozens more exhausted faces to match my own, my legs having officially decided they’ve had enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m feeling somewhat jaded, yet there’s no doubt in my mind this is as close as I’ll ever get to being a professional cyclist – riding stage by stage over stunningly beautiful mountains, everything from hotels to massages taken care of in the background, my only worry having to ride the next day. The entire experience leaves me wanting to come back. Albeit next time with mountain legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Triple jeopardy</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Haute Route Davos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/haute-route-davos-11.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>We attempt to crack a smile despite the obvious lack of the donkeys we were promised along the route.</figcaption><figcaption>Olivier Penpenic, Sportograf</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Haute Route Davos is set out over three days with two courses on offer – original and compact, with the latter offering a slightly shortened but nonetheless still gruelling version of the former, with both ending in a time-trial up the Flüela Pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haute Route supplies a backpack system where riders can leave their bag at the start line and receive it at the finish line of every stage.

We flew into Zürich airport then took the train, which includes just one change, takes two hours and 40 minutes and is worth it for the scenic journey alone. Davos is also a two-hour drive from Zürich should you prefer to enjoy the scenery by car.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation<strong> </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Haute Route offers a range of accommodation packages, and all hotels are located close to the Haute Route Village. We stayed at Hotel Strela, which was a short walk away, and shared a twin room and had some very hearty breakfasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks<strong> </strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to Haute Route for inviting us to take part and for hosting us in Davos. Special thanks also to Nadia Alexandrou from Frette Rogerson PR for helping arrange our stay.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/haute-route-davos\">The high roads: Haute Route Davos sportive review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b6f42587e28a26bc6a7ee9c180a6c0e7958fba1d50de01891d60e0264edcbfb1","category":"Cycling"}
