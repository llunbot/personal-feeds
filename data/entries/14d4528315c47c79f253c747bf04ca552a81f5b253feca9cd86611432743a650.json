The ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max will continue to be made exclusively in China.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has experienced quality control issues with some Indian suppliers, limiting manufacturers to certain models and color options. Earlier this year, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/14/only-half-of-indian-iphone-casings-meet-standards/\">reported</a> that only one in two ‌iPhone‌ casings coming off Tata's production line in India \"is in good enough shape\" to be sent forward to assembly at Foxconn.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn previous years, initial batches of new iPhones have exclusively been made in China, before India comes on stream gradually in the following months. With the ‌iPhone 15‌ lineup, Apple apparently expects to ship new devices from both countries simultaneously for the first time.
