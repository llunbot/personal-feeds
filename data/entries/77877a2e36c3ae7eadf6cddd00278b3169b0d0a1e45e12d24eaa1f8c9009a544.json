{"title":"The ‘Reimagine’ Feature on Google’s New Pixel 9 Phones Makes It Trivial to Create Deepfakes","link":"https://www.threads.net/@chriswelch/post/C-8LF4BOSAP/","date":1724697677000,"content":"\n<p>Chris Welch, in a thread on Threads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The “Reimagine” feature on Google’s new Pixel 9 lineup is\nincredible. It’s so impressive that testing it has left me feeling\nuneasy on multiple occasions.</p>\n\n<p>With a simple prompt, you can add things to photos that were never\nthere. And the company’s Gemini AI makes it look astonishingly\nrealistic. This all happens right from the phone’s default photo\neditor app. In about five seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Are we ready to go down this path? Now that the embargo has\nlifted, let me show you some examples. Buckle up.</p>\n\n<p>The images you’ll see in this thread are all straight out of\nGoogle Photos after going through Reimagine / Magic Editor. They\nwere never touched up by Photoshop or Lightroom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the one hand, this technology becoming ubiquitous feels inevitable. On the other hand, these examples from Welch are disturbing.</p>\n\n<p>At The Verge, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/26/24228808/ai-image-editing-photoshop-comparison-argument\">Jess Weatherbed writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just because <em>you</em> have the estimable ability to clock when an\nimage is fake doesn’t mean everyone can. Not everyone skulks\naround on tech forums (we love you all, fellow skulkers), so the\ntypical indicators of AI that seem obvious to us can be easy to\nmiss for those who don’t know what signs to look for — if they’re\neven there at all. AI is rapidly getting better at <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/19/24044203/think-youre-good-at-spotting-ai-made-photos-of-people\">producing\nnatural-looking images</a> that don’t have seven fingers or\nCronenberg-esque distortions.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it was easy to spot when the occasional deepfake was\ndumped into our feeds, but the scale of production has shifted\nseismically in the last two years alone. It’s incredibly easy to\nmake this stuff, so now it’s fucking <em>everywhere</em>. We are\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225972/ai-photo-era-what-is-reality-google-pixel-9\">dangerously close to living in a world</a> in which we have\nto be wary about being deceived by every single image put in\nfront of us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s seemingly where we’re headed. Everyone alive today has grown up in a world where you can’t believe everything you read. Now we need to adapt to a world where that applies just as equally to photos and videos. Trusting the <em>sources</em> of what we believe is becoming more important than ever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> “<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/21/google-pixel-editing-image-creation-tools/\">Elmo drunk driving and holding a beer</a>.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/26/welch-reimagine-pixel-9\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"77877a2e36c3ae7eadf6cddd00278b3169b0d0a1e45e12d24eaa1f8c9009a544","category":"Tech"}
