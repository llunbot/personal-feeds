Throughout its 203mm rear wheel travel, the Jedi’s effective rear centre lengthens by a substantial 19mm. This multi-link incarnation of a high pivot suspension platform is one of the more unusual ones we’ve seen, requiring a split seat tube and shock tunnel that give rise to a more retro aesthetic. But don’t be fooled, the Canfield Jedi 29 geometry is very much of the modern era.</p><h2>Canfield Jedi 29 DH</h2><div id=\"attachment_280508\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280508\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side.jpg\" alt=\"canfield jedi 29 raw frameset\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09101546/Canfield-Jedi-Frame-Raw-Side-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280508\">Frames are available to pre-order now for $2,299 USD</p></div><p>Fans of this boutique mountain bike brand can breathe a sigh of relief; the new Canfield Jedi 29 still looks like a Jedi, and actually still bears a striking resemblance to the Big Fat Fatty Fat, the very first mountain bike brought to market by Canfield Brothers. Ahead of its time perhaps, that bike ran a high-pivot multi-link suspension layout not dissimilar to what we see here today.</p><p>Despite <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canfield-brothers-part-ways-to-form-separate-canfield-bikes-cbf-suspension-entities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the split of Canfield Brothers</a> into separate entities, Canfield Bikes and CBF Suspension, the bike brand has been allowed to continue its use of their suspension platforms, hence the continued use of the Formula 1 suspension layout seen here on the new Jedi 29.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork.jpg\" alt=\"canfield jedi raw 29 complete bike\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102043/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-29-complete-bike-manitou-dorado-usd-fork-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>On this newest model, the linkage layout is revised to incorporate a new shock position. On the previous <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canfield-bros/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">27.5″ Jedi</a>, the shock mounted to the underside of the top-tube, whereas the Jedi 29 sees the shock mounted to the topside of the downtube. This was necessary in allowing Canfield to revise the bike’s kinematic, fine-tuning anti-squat and anti-rise numbers by tweaking the various positions of the pivots and length of the links.</p><p>Of course, the major update here is the switch to a 29″ wheelset, bringing the Canfield Jedi into the modern era where we see many downhill athletes preferring to run the larger wheel size. That’s not what Lance Canfield, creator of the Jedi 29, is most stoked on, however. He says the rearward axle path of the revised Canfield Formula 1 suspension design gives the Jedi the unnatural ability to not only maintain its speed, but actually accelerate through rough terrain.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5.jpg\" alt=\"canfield jedi 29 formula 1 suspension linkage layout\" width=\"1600\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5-297x124.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5-800x333.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5-120x50.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5-768x320.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09102755/Canfield-Jedi-Raw-Complete-Detail-5-1536x639.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>A revised leverage rate is said to provide more supple small-bump sensitivity at the top of the stroke, while a more progressive end-stroke offers a smooth, bottomless transition on big hits. Meanwhile, improved mid-stroke support is said to result in a more poppy, responsive ride.</p><p>The high-pivot suspension design means chain growth is minimal (claimed less than 1mm), so pedal kickback shouldn’t be a feature of this ride. Canfield tells us that braking performance has also been revised for slightly less anti-rise, so the bike remains more neutral and predictable under heavy braking.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry.jpg\" alt=\"canfield jedi 29 geometry chart\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1033\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry-297x192.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry-800x517.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry-120x77.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry-768x496.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09103547/canfield-jedi-29-geometry-1536x992.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Jedi 29 is pretty slack with a 200mm fork sat at a 62.5° head angle. Across the M-XL size range, reach stretches from 450mm up to 500mm, with chainstays set at 427mm across the board. While that may sound very short (it is), the chainstay length actually grows under sag to an effective 443mm.</p><p>We’d like to share a few more details on the Canfield Jedi 29, but are waiting on further info from Canfield with regard to the leverage curve, shock compatibility, rear axle path and more.
