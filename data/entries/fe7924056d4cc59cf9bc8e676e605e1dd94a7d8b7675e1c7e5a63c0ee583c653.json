Of course, the kinematic is also tweaked to take on the high speeds and big compressions of World Cup DH racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"forbidden dh bike inverted 4-bar linkage drive side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-drive-side-linkage-layout.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an inverted four-bar linkage, wherein the lower link rotates clockwise as the rear wheel is displaced, driving the shock into compression. As it does so, the chainstay also arcs rearward, delivering a rearward rear axle path. As such, the effective rear-center length increases as the bike is pushed through its rear wheel travel, a feature we have come to expect from Forbidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"forbidden dh bike inverted 4-bar linkage nds view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-nds-linkage-layout.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a layout would result in significant chain growth and the undesirable ride characteristics that come with it, like pedal kickback, if it weren’t for the idler pulley that routes the chain closer to that high main pivot location on the seat tube. The Forbidden DH bike runs an 18t idler pulley, the location of which cannot be adjusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"forbidden dh bike 4-bar high pivot idler pulley 18t\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-high-pivot-idler-puller-3d-printed-guide.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Forbidden aren’t revealing too much about geometry or kinematic yet, but we are told it exhibits more anti-squat than the Druid, with more mid-stroke support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The as-of-yet unnamed Forbidden DH bike shares much of its frame hardware with the Druid, including the rear axle. Indeed, this DH frame actually runs Boost rear end spacing (12mm x 148mm) as opposed to the 157mm spacing more commonly seen on DH bikes. That means the rear wheel of any modern trail or enduro bike is likely to fit this frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cable routing is external, running underneath the 3D printed rubber headtube protection. The shock fender on this pre-production frame is also 3D printed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"forbidden dh frame 3d printed headtube protection cable guides\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-dh-bike-fort-william-world-champs-2023-external-cable-routing-carbon-frame.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"forbidden dh frame carbon external cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-cables-external.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"forbidden dh bike 3d printed shock fender\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/forbidden-downhill-bike-3d-printed-shock-fender.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pat Campbell-Jenner from Forbidden tells us complete builds and frame only will be offered.
