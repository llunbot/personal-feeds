The current gesture requires long pressing before swiping to change the active watch face. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>watchOS 10.2 beta 3 adds back the feature that allows you to swipe between watch faces!<br /><br />This feature was removed in watchOS 10.0 <a href=\"https://t.co/7OWgdMkp72\">pic.twitter.com/7OWgdMkp72</a></p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1724952001681789227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nWith watchOS 10.2, Apple Watch owners who preferred the prior method of changing their watch faces can choose to enable the setting if desired. The option is under Settings &gt; Clock in the third beta. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nwatchOS 10.2 is available to both developers and public beta testers at this time, and it is expected to see a public launch in December.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135\">Apple Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/watchos-10-2-watch-face-swipe-change/\">watchOS 10.2 Beta Reintroduces Option to Change Apple Watch Faces With a Swipe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-2-beta-reintroduces-option-to-change-apple-watch-faces-with-a-swipe.2411103/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"201699062a8d48c5a69309226d28160040db4f30a2212139942c8a1ea7e309cb","category":"Apple"}
