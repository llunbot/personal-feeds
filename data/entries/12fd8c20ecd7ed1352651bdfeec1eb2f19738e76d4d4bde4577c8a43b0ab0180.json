These bags are made from deadstock and scrap materials with remnants of bar tape left over from production. Retail is $95</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/New-Western-Bag_2.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/New-Western-Bag_2.jpg?w=1200&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/New-Western-Bag_2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Camp and Go Slow are also restocking Western Rattler tape with updated packaging. The stuff sacks for the Western and Eastern bar tapes are now made in Seattle. They have a much nicer finish quality and switched the coyote fabric out for brown. We use the stuff sacks for all sorts of things!  Western and Eastern tape retails for $44.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Patch-Patch_1.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Patch-Patch_1.jpg?w=1200&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Patch-Patch_1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Patch-Patch_7.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Patch-Patch_7.jpg?w=1200&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Patch-Patch_7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>For people who don’t run tubeless, or converted cyclists who remember the age before tubeless, these patches will hit you with a different sort of nostalgia. Perhaps our favorite product in this drop are the inner-tube patch kit patches. They’re iron on and ready to stick on any fabric. Best of all, they’re only $8.</p>\n<p>These products will hit the <a href=\"https://www.campandgoslow.com/products?page=1\" target=\"_blank\">Camp and Go Slow webshop</a> at 12 Noon PST.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/camp-and-go-slow-spring-24-drop/\">Camp and Go Slow Spring ’24 Drop</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"12fd8c20ecd7ed1352651bdfeec1eb2f19738e76d4d4bde4577c8a43b0ab0180","category":"Cycling"}
