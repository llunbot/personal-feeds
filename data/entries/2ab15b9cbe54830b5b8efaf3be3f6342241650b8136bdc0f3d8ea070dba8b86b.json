On the previous generation models, the cellular versions of both the ‌iPad Air‌ and the ‌iPad Pro‌ included a physical SIM card slot. In the new devices, that's no longer the case. All cellular models now support eSIM only.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's a small but crucial detail for anyone looking to upgrade their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> while sticking with their current cellular plan. Apple has not divulged the reason why it chose to remove the physical SIM slot, but it could have been a design decision related to making the devices slimmer, or a necessity to keep them slim, given all of the devices' hardware upgrades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEither way, the change brings parity to Apple's latest ‌iPad‌ models and its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, which dropped the physical SIM slot in 2022 with the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/\">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-air-ipad-pro-no-sim-slot/\">Apple's New Cellular iPad Air and iPad Pro Models Are eSIM Only</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-cellular-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-models-are-esim-only.2425644/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2ab15b9cbe54830b5b8efaf3be3f6342241650b8136bdc0f3d8ea070dba8b86b","category":"Apple"}
