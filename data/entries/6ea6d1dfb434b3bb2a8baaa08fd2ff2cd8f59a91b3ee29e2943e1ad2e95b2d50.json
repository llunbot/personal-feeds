The ruling was <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange-2/\">issued today</a> by the UK's High Court of Justice in London.</p>\n<p>Today's decision came in response to the United States' appeal of a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/uk-blocks-assange-extradition-due-to-suicide-risk-poor-us-jail-conditions/\">January 2021 district judge's ruling</a> that rejected the extradition request on the grounds that Assange would be at greater risk of suicide in the American prison system. The district judge's ruling criticized US prison conditions and noted that \"Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide at the MCC jail in August 2019\" and Chelsea Manning \"was hospitalized after an attempt to commit suicide at the ADC jail [William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center in Alexandria, Virginia] in 2020.\"</p>\n<p>In February, the US offered several assurances to the UK about how Assange will be treated after extradition. The High Court was satisfied that these assurances \"[e]xclude the possibility of Mr. Assange being made subject to 'special administrative measures' or held at the 'ADX' facility (a maximum-security prison in Florence, Colorado, in the US), either pretrial or after any conviction, unless, after entry of the assurances, he commits any future act which renders him liable to such conditions of detention,\" according to the court's <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/USA-v-Assange-summary-101221.pdf\">summary of today's ruling</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819586#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819586&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ea6d1dfb434b3bb2a8baaa08fd2ff2cd8f59a91b3ee29e2943e1ad2e95b2d50","category":"Tech"}
