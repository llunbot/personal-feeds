Intel Macs released between December of 2017 and 2020 are mostly eligible for the new update, though newer models with Apple Silicon chips will be needed to support some of the new features.</p>\n<p>Apple's full support list for Sequoia is as follows:</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-2.50.50%E2%80%AFPM.jpeg\"><img alt=\"The support list for macOS 15 Sequoia.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-2.50.50%E2%80%AFPM-980x609.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-2.50.50%E2%80%AFPM.jpeg\">The support list for macOS 15 Sequoia.</a> (credit: Apple)</p></div>\n<p>Generally, all of these Macs include Apple's T2 chip, a co-processor installed in late-model Intel Macs that bridged the gap between the Intel and Apple Silicon eras. There are two exceptions. The biggest is the 2018 MacBook Air, which did come with an Apple T2 but also shipped with a weak dual-core processor and integrated GPU that Apple has apparently decided aren't up to the task of handling Sequoia. The other is the 2019 iMac, which for whatever reason shipped without a T2. Apple says the iPhone mirroring feature does require the T2 chip, so it presumably won't work on the 2019 iMac.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030138#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030138&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f18dddde4535a89727e378aeace4e4b9ee312b63c0900e021b7c24ac880b9de4","category":"Tech"}
