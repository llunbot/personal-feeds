Over the course of nearly a dozen years, this was the 31st cargo supply mission that SpaceX has flown for NASA to the orbiting laboratory.</p>\n<p>However, there is one characteristic of this flight that may prove significant for NASA and the future of the space station. As early as Friday, NASA and SpaceX have scheduled a \"reboost and attitude control demonstration,\" during which the Dragon spacecraft will use some of the thrusters at the base of the capsule. This is the first time the Dragon spacecraft will be used to move the space station.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/for-the-first-time-a-dragon-spacecraft-will-be-used-to-move-the-space-station/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/for-the-first-time-a-dragon-spacecraft-will-be-used-to-move-the-space-station/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"72771b9f542ac228058458ceb5efb9d694974668ee00e61851db2b686d69fcd8","category":"Tech"}
