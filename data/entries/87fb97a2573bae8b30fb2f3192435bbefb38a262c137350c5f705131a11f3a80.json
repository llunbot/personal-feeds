Giuliani to pay $148 million \nto two former Georgia election workers who said he had destroyed \ntheir reputations with lies that they tried to steal the 2020 \nelection from Donald J. Trump. </p>\n\n<p>Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington \nhad already ruled that Mr. Giuliani had defamed the two workers, \nRuby Freeman and Shaye Moss. The jury had been asked to decide \nonly on the amount of the damages. </p>\n\n<p>The jury awarded Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss a combined $75 million \nin punitive damages. It also ordered Mr. Giuliani to pay \ncompensatory damages of $16.2 million to Ms. Freeman and $16.9 \nmillion to Ms. Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for \nemotional suffering. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m sure Rudy isn’t concerned — he’s good friends with the former president of the United States, who swears he’s a multi-billionaire and is a loyal friend, so I’m sure he’ll foot the bill. (Multi-billionaires often find themselves hawking <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/12/trump-sells-mugshot-suit-mar-a-lago-dinner-in-latest-nft-promotion.html\">NFT comic-book portraits of themselves on trading cards</a>. Totally normal thing to do.) No need to worry that Giuliani will need to switch to plastic jug scotch.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/15/giuliani-148m\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"87fb97a2573bae8b30fb2f3192435bbefb38a262c137350c5f705131a11f3a80","category":"Tech"}
