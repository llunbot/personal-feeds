But that’s exactly what’s happening right now. Ahead of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348998/amazon-prime-day-apple-deals-2023.html\">Prime Day</a>, being held July 11-12, Amazon has slashed prices on every MacBook Air and Pro model but at least $100 and as much as $200, including the newest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5KWB9H?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">13-inch MacBook Air (M1, 7-core GPU, 256GB): $799</a> ($200 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch MacBook Air (M2, 8-core GPU, 256GB): $999</a> ($100 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3C5HTGG?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch MacBook Air  (M2, 10-core GPU, 512GB): $1,299</a> ($100 off, MSRP $1,399)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7686169/ref=fs_a_mbt2_us1?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">15-inch MacBook Air (M2, 10-core GPU, 256GB): $1,199</a> ($100 off, MSRP $1,299)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0B3C5HNXJ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch MacBook Pro (M2, 10-core GPU 256GB): $1,099</a> ($200 off, MSRP $1,299)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0B3C8XMXM?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch MacBook Pro (M2, 10-core GPU, 512GB): $1,299</a> ($200 off, MSRP $1,499)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHDVBXZ/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">14-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Pro, 10-core CPU/19‑core GPU, 512GB)</a>: $1,799 ($200 off, MSRP $1,999)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHF7LLL/ref=fs_a_mbt2_us4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">16-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Pro, 12-core CPU/19‑core GPU, 512GB)</a>: $2,299 ($200 off, MSRP $2,499)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these prices are at or near all-time lows, and they’re all excellent options. Even the M1 MacBook Air, which is more than two years old and still sporting an M1 chip, is a great laptop for high school and college students, and the new 15-inch Air is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948733/theres-only-one-macbook-worth-buying-right-now.html\">basically the perfect laptop</a>. We don’t know how long these sales will last or if Amazon is planning any deeper discounts once Prime Day officially arrives, but if you need a MacBook, there’s never been a better time to buy one.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"89ee7bf55481dae923fcddd0bfeddb4386740a2eb56929f232d281178a3b3377","category":"Apple"}
