The legacy 3G spectrum will be used to enhance 5G capacity in the future.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBy the mid-2020s, BT will fully integrate fiber, Wi-Fi, and mobile network infrastructure for more secure and reliable connectivity. This will be \"the UK's first fully converged network,\" which will allow BT to build next-generation fiber and 5G networks simultaneously.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo extend mobile coverage, EE is expanding 4G connectivity deeper into rural areas, adding over 4,500 square miles of new coverage by 2025. In parallel EE's 5G network, which launched two years ago, will grow to cover half of the UK population by early 2023, four years ahead of the British Government's target. 5G is expected to surpass the geographic reach of 4G to become the UK's largest digital network by 2028, providing a signal to over 90 percent of the UK's landmass.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo reach its goals, BT will deploy its recently obtained 700MHz 5G spectrum to the majority of EE sites. It will also use Neutral Host systems to support better 4G and 5G coverage in busy environments like airports, stadia, and campuses. Portable cells in a fleet of rapid response vehicles will provide temporary mobile connectivity to customers when they need it, and BT is also intending to use more air and space technologies, including drones and Low Earth Orbit satellites, having signed an early agreement with satellite internet company OneWeb last month. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ee/\">EE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bt/\">BT</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/bt-to-expand-5g-to-entire-uk-by-2028/\">BT to Expand 5G to Entire UK by 2028 Using Drones, Satellites, and Portable Cells, Will End 3G Service by 2023</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bt-to-expand-5g-to-entire-uk-by-2028-using-drones-satellites-and-portable-cells-will-end-3g-service-by-2023.2304227/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vgIsbzjAr3M:Bkl4p3XczRY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vgIsbzjAr3M:Bkl4p3XczRY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vgIsbzjAr3M\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"53cf2a0163d6af63feee5314586b2b73ad7957758edb8e32a16117daa3f512cb","category":"Apple"}
