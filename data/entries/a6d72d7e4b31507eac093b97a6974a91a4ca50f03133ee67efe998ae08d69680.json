It has not, however, released any games that are playable on a living room TV.</p>\n<p>That's technically still the case. When you open up the iPhone app, you're told to \"choose a game on your TV and follow the directions to connect,\" but that process does not appear to be supported by any of Netflix's smart TV, game console, or streaming box apps yet. In fact, there's absolutely nothing you can do with the Game Controller app right now. \"Netflix Games on TV are in beta. Some devices may not be supported at this time,\" a note at the bottom of the app says.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959645#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959645&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6d72d7e4b31507eac093b97a6974a91a4ca50f03133ee67efe998ae08d69680","category":"Tech"}
