Over the years, we've seen them used to infiltrate an <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet-the-most-menacing-malware-in-history/\">Iranian nuclear facility</a>, infect critical control systems in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/01/two-us-power-plants-infected-with-malware-spread-via-usb-drive/\">US power plants,</a> morph into programmable, undetectable<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/this-thumbdrive-hacks-computers-badusb-exploit-makes-devices-turn-evil/\"> attack platforms</a>, and destroy attached computers with a surprise <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/usb-killer-flash-drive-can-fry-your-computers-innards-in-seconds/\">220-volt electrical surge</a>.

Each of the USB sticks was meant to explode when activated.</p>\n<p>Upon receiving the drive, Lenin Artieda of the Ecuavisa TV station in Guayaquil inserted it into his computer, at which point it exploded. According to a police official who spoke with AFP, the journalist suffered mild hand and face injuries, and no one else was harmed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925950#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925950&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6bcea78f6575abd0a43064aeab36650acf3a64a24d69cd0630bb612c2dd26111","category":"Tech"}
