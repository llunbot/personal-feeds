The tyre uses a new compound that Conti says improves longevity and wet weather grip and increases sidewall damage protection. There’s an option with sidewall reflectivity to increase low light visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grand Prix 5000 TT TR tyre goes the other way, reducing weight and rolling resistance for time trial use. It uses a thinner carcass than the existing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/continental-gp5000-s-tr\" target=\"_blank\">GP 5000 S TR</a>, but still includes Conti’s Vectran breaker for puncture protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Continental Grand Prix 5000 AS TR all-season tyre</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"556\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Continental-Grand-Prix-5000-AS-TR-tyre1.jpg\" alt=\"Continental Grand Prix 5000 AS TR all season tyre\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Continental-Grand-Prix-5000-AS-TR-tyre1.jpg 556w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Continental-Grand-Prix-5000-AS-TR-tyre1-300x169.jpg 300w\" /><figcaption>Continental</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in 25mm, 28mm, 32mm and 35mm widths, the new Grand Prix 5000 AS TR tyre is designed for four season use, making it an option to add to your list of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-road-bike-tyres-stay-puncture-free\">best winter road bike tyres</a>. It adds extra protection from sidewall damage with four-ply 110tpi sidewalls, rather than the current <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/continental-gp5000-s-tr\">Grand Prix 5000 S TR</a> tyre’s three. There are black and cream sidewall options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conti has increased the thickness of the tread rubber to increase longevity. It’s also reformulated its BlackChili compound and added extra tread to increase grip in wet, cooler conditions. The claimed weight of the new tyre is 300g for a 25mm width, adding around 50g to the weight of the GP 5000 S TR tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Continental claims that despite the beefed up <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gripping-stuff-what-makes-a-tyre\">tyre construction</a>, the new tyre provides the speed and performance of the current GP 5000 S TR.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/continental-gp5000-s-tr\">The new Continental GP5000 S TR is hookless-compatible and better in every way</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/which-is-faster-continental-gp5000-tubeless-or-clincher\">Which is faster: Continental GP5000 tubeless or clincher?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-are-tyres-made\">How are tyres made?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>According to Oliver Anhuth, head of marketing for two-wheel tyres at Continental: ‘Our project to balance speed and longevity in a single premium tyre stemmed from the feedback and requests from thousands of Grand Prix 5000 and 4 Season riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Three years of development has resulted in the Grand Prix 5000 AS TR: a tyre for cyclists who welcome the challenge of riding in all seasons and all weathers but don’t want to compromise on speed and performance.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The comparison with Conti’s longstanding GP 4 Season tyre, which is a popular swap-out for winter riding, shows the brand’s positioning of the new tyre. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the GP 4 Season is a tubed tyre, the new GP 5000 AS TR is a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\">tubeless tyre</a>, which should provide a greater measure of puncture protection when riding in the off-season. It should also reduce rolling resistance over the existing GP 4 Season tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continental says that it will sell the two tyres alongside each other, but look to retire the GP 4 Season at a future date. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-970x649.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-970x649.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-768x514.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-750x502.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-1140x763.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Shift-Conti-Sept-2022-5231.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Continental</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Conti isn’t just aiming the new tyre at performance riders, but says that its robust construction, grip and range of widths should make it a good option for fast commutes and fast gravel riding too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the existing GP 5000 S TR tyre, the new GP 5000 AS TR tyre is compatible with hookless beads, keeping it abreast of wheel tech and providing compatibility with the rims on the latest generation of wheels from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/enve-updates-ses-wheelset-range\">Enve</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-overhauls-race-performance-wheelsets-new-404-firecrest-and-454-nsw-designs\">Zipp</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyre tech from the GP 5000 S TR tyre includes Conti’s Active Comfort Technology, which it says reduces the transfer of road vibrations to the rider and Lazer Grip tyre profile, which is claimed to improve cornering.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"556\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Continental-Grand-Prix-5000-AS-TR-tyre-black1.jpg\" alt=\"Continental Grand Prix 5000 AS TR all season tyre\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Continental-Grand-Prix-5000-AS-TR-tyre-black1.jpg 556w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Continental-Grand-Prix-5000-AS-TR-tyre-black1-300x169.jpg 300w\" /><figcaption>Continental</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cream sidewalls may look good and help you stand out a little, but they’ll probably need a lot of scrubbing to keep them clean in winter conditions.

It goes the other way from the AS tyre, reducing carcass weight by using two layers of 110tpi fabric rather than the four in the AS and three in the S tyres, and adjusting the tread thickness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That reduces the weight of a 25mm tyre to a claimed 220g. It also increases the tyre’s suppleness and, Conti says, decreases the rolling resistance. Like Conti’s other GP 5000 TR tyres, the new TT tyre is hookless bead-compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some time trial tyres abandon the puncture protection layer to reduce their weight, but Continental has kept its Vectran breaker in the GP 5000 TT TR tyre, pointing out that there’s no point in being able to ride fast if you flat before you reach the finishing line. It reckons that the optimum set-up for lowest rolling resistance is a 25mm front tyre and 28mm rear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conti has added <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\">UAE </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">Team Emirates</a> to its long roster of teams riding on its tyres this year, which also includes <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/team-ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>.
