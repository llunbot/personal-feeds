By removing chip functionality that the Pi 5 didn't use, the new D0 stepping of the chip would use less silicon, reducing its cost.</p>\n<p>Raspberry Pi enthusiast and YouTuber Jeff Geerling has <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/new-2gb-pi-5-has-33-smaller-die-30-idle-power-savings\">performed some firsthand testing</a> of the 2GB Pi 5. As Upton said, the new board is functionally identical to the older 4GB and 8GB boards, with identical performance (as long as whatever workload you're running doesn't benefit from extra RAM, anyway). The new silicon die is also <a href=\"https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1828177919765532758\">about 33 percent smaller</a> than the old one, which Geerling verified by <a href=\"https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1828177615640739901\">removing the SoC's heat spreader</a> to expose the silicon underneath and measuring by hand.</p>\n<p>Geerling also demonstrated that the 2GB Pi 5 comes with a couple of unexpected benefits that Upton didn't mention in his announcement—that the 2GB Pi 5 runs a little cooler and uses a little less power than the 4GB and 8GB editions. The 2GB Pi used just 2.4 W of power at idle and 8.9 W during a CPU stress test, compared to 3.3 W and 9.8 W in the 4GB version. The SoC of the 2GB Pi measured 30° Celsius at idle and 59° under load, compared to 32° and 63° for the 2GB version. Those are all small but significant differences, given that nothing has changed other than the SoC.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046291#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046291&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f9f22cefa1afb026c71756a645a96a4ee68e8d225b3ea22123a200b4b2d71a3","category":"Tech"}
