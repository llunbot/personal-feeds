Commentators Matt Stephens and Hannah Walker will call the race finale as professionals, while defending champs Lauren De Crescenzo and Keegan Swenson, Luke Lamperti, Sarah Sturm, and Sofía Gómez Villafañe tackle one of the world’s most spectacular cycling routes, nestled among the coastal hills of Sonoma County in Northern California. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be the first time since 2020, when the Tour of California ran its final edition, that long-distance road racing will be broadcast live from within the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levis2024Podium.webp\" alt=\"The 2024 Women's Growler Podium\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levis2024Podium.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levis2024Podium-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levis2024Podium-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levis2024Podium-768x576.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Champion Lauren De Crescenzo stands atop the 2024 Women’s Growler Podium.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the surge in popularity of gravel racing, road racing in the US has declined in both participation and cultural awareness in recent years, but Levi’s GranFondo and other well-established road cycling events continue to be popular and highly competitive. The roads of Sonoma Country prove that you can still have an epic adventure on skinny tires. While there are routes in the event for every level of cyclist, the Growler is the crown jewel and amasses nearly 14,000 feet of vertical gain over its 138-mile distance. Yeah… ouch. The Growler is on par with queen stages of The Giro d’Italia, Tour De France, and Vuelta Espana – races in which event founder Levi Leipheimer made his mark while racing professionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1.webp\"><img width=\"1256\" height=\"837\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1.webp\" alt=\"Racers wind through Sonoma County\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1.webp 1256w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisGF1-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Sonoma County offers world-class road riding and no shortage of hills</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leipheimer retired from professional road racing in 2013, after a successful career that ended under less than ideal circumstances resulting from his time at the now infamous United Sates Postal Servie Team. Whatever mistakes he made as a bike racer, he’s clearly done a lot to redeem himself through Levi’s GranFondo and its charitable contributions in the Santa Rosa area. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"930\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LeviRacing-1.webp\" alt=\"Levi Lipeheimer corners during a professional road race\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LeviRacing-1.webp 930w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LeviRacing-1-297x210.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LeviRacing-1-120x85.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LeviRacing-1-768x544.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Event founder Levi Lipeheimer was among the world’s best during his career. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Levi’s GranFondo is a proud sponsor of the NorCal League, which aims to get kids on bikes at a young age, which in turn leads to the development of a select few world-class bike riders. Systems like the NorCal League are well-established in Europe but are starting to gain momentum stateside as well, producing riders like Luke Lamperti, who took part in the NorCal League while growing up in nearby Sabastapol. Lamperti captured the United States Elite Criterium Championship in 2021, becoming the youngest racer to ever win the stars and stripes in that discipline. Lamperti now rides for UCI World Tour Team Soudal-QuickStep, but will be lining up for The Growler with hopes of crossing the line first and claiming the winner’s share of the $156,000 prize purse – the largest one-day prize purse in the world of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1060\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LampertiSprintWin.webp\" alt=\"Luke Lamperti salutes after winning a sprint \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LampertiSprintWin.webp 1060w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LampertiSprintWin-297x168.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LampertiSprintWin-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LampertiSprintWin-768x435.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Lamperti has proven himself at the Wold Tour level. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lamperti will have to best some elite competition, including Keegan Swenson, who has been terrorizing U.S. gravel racing of late, and will have ample opportunity to exploit his MTB skills descending the steep and weathered roads that punctuate the parcours. Other US-born and now “retired” World Tour pro’s on the start line will include Chad Haga, who won the final time trial of the 2019 Giro D’Italia, Ian Boswell, who helped Team Sky win a string of Tours De France with Chris Froome and Gerraint Thomas in yellow, as well as Alex Howes, Peter Stetina, and Ted King. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1.webp\" alt=\"Keegan Swenson, Peter Stentina and company battle in 2024's Levi's Gran Fondo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LevisBigHitters-1-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Keegan Sweson is the defending champion.

Competitors include current US National Gravel Champion Lauren Stephens, Unbound Gravel and Leadville Trail 100 podium finisher, and 2019 Belgian Waffle Winner Sarah Sturm. Others to watch include defending champion Lauren De Crescenzo, who also won both Unbound and SBT GRVL in 2021. A dark horse to watch is 5-time World Cup MTB podium finisher Haley Smith of Waterloo, QB, Canada. Argentinian Sofía Gómez Villafañe, winner of Unbound Gravel in 2022, will almost certainly factor in the final two hours of this epic day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1800\" height=\"990\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LaurenDeCrescenzo2.webp\" alt=\"Lauren De Crescenzo en route to winning The Growler in 2024.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LaurenDeCrescenzo2.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LaurenDeCrescenzo2-297x163.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LaurenDeCrescenzo2-1536x845.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LaurenDeCrescenzo2-120x66.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LaurenDeCrescenzo2-768x422.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Lauren De Crescenzo en route to winning The Growler in 2024.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/routes/3311163417722260726?utm_medium=web_embed&amp;utm_source=route_embed&amp;strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Froutes%2F3311163417722260726&amp;_branch_match_id=1427113246591676825&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA32OSwqDMBCGTxOXahJRKEgpLd6gi65ComOVJkYmie569kYtXRZmMTMf%2F2PwfnanLHMe5SJTOc%2BpHqdXJuUjv5sFVqfOhBW91FrJ9iUC6nrYNIRfCGvifJWtNfFAGzy4uHBOKS15QauKMVbmFSsJb4I3wkA3BkP4bQUlwCjoCCs34GzAFiLYTQ6UHO6iA5i3Xnv%2B8fsV%2BJeZvBF6QBynp1BoVwdYXwe0Bj7Vyi%2Fk%2BQAAAA%3D%3D\">The Growler route</a> begins and ends in Windsor, CA, and features the iconic King’s Ridge Road, which is a rolling, rollicking, and deliriously beautiful stretch of ancient tarmac that takes riders northwest, through the remote coastal hills of Sonoma County. From there, the course turns inland for more punchy terrain, eventually passing Lake Sonoma and returning to more gentle riding through Russian River Valley. After that brief respite, several decisive climbs will decide the race and make for great viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TheGrolwer2025Route.webp\"><img width=\"1793\" height=\"823\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TheGrolwer2025Route.webp\" alt=\"The Growler Strava route\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TheGrolwer2025Route.webp 1793w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TheGrolwer2025Route-297x136.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TheGrolwer2025Route-1536x705.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TheGrolwer2025Route-120x55.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TheGrolwer2025Route-768x353.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The Growler’s route is truly stunning in scope and difficulty. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Growler can be seen live starting at 11:00 AM PST on Saturday, April 19th, at <a href=\"https://thetascgroup-com-dot-focus-nucleus-442213-v2.uc.r.appspot.com/?c=1sHbadiJE2R5dyBeohFxMCMe6NU8XkiSbRYBcXcfzy5I&amp;q=1422349711&amp;r=1952416ac3435f59&amp;z=1740067221240&amp;o=http%3A%2F%2Flevisgranfondo.com\" target=\"_blank\">levisgranfondo.com</a>, and will stream via YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/see-levis-granfondo-the-growler-live-on-youtube-april-19th/\">See Levi’s GranFondo The Growler Live on Youtube April 19th</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"421382e33aee6d83b3c6bc2b3ad9b85dc15333c0a1c0a9a33886888091fb1d56","category":"Cycling"}
