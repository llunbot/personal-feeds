Competitors like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrolyLegs\">BrolyLegs</a> and numerous hardware hackers have taken the seemingly inhospitable genre even further.</p>\n<p><em>Tekken 8</em>, due later this month, seems to aim even higher, offering a number of color vision options in its settings. This includes an unofficially monikered \"colorblind mode,\" with black-and-white and detail-diminished backgrounds and characters' flattened shapes filled in with either horizontal or vertical striped lines. But what started out as excitement in the fighting game and accessibility communities about this offering has shifted into warnings about the potential for migraines, vertigo, or even seizures.</p>\n<p>You can see the mode in action in <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/\">the Windows demo</a> or in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzq4ql0ZPIw\">a YouTube video shared by Gatterall</a>—which, of course, you should not view if you believe yourself susceptible to issues with strobing images. Gatterall's enthusiasm for <em>Tekken 8</em>'s take on colorblind accessibility (\"Literally no game has done this\") drew <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1740164842940710943\">comment from Katsuhiro Harada</a>, head of the Tekken games for developer and publisher Bandai Namco, on X (formerly Twitter). Harada stated that he had developed and tested \"an accessibility version\" of <em>Tekken 7</em>, which was never shipped or sold. Harada states that those \"studies\" made it into <em>Tekken 8.</em></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993271#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993271&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3dac950cc77ffba84186e817d7a234d2279ba88098524c702b38c9578a06868e","category":"Tech"}
