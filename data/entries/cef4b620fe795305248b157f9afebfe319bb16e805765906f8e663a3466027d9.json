The engine ran for approximately 60 seconds, and SpaceX confirmed the test-firing in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1922361827712725019\">post on X</a>: \"Starship completed a long duration six-engine static fire and is undergoing final preparations for the ninth flight test.\"</p>\n<p>SpaceX hasn't officially announced a target launch date, but maritime warnings along Starship's flight path over the Gulf of Mexico suggest the launch might happen as soon as next Wednesday, May 21. The launch window would open at 6:30 pm local time (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC). If everything goes according to plan, Starship is expected to soar into space and fly halfway around the world, targeting a reentry and controlled splashdown into the Indian Ocean.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-test-fires-starship-for-an-all-important-next-flight/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-test-fires-starship-for-an-all-important-next-flight/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cef4b620fe795305248b157f9afebfe319bb16e805765906f8e663a3466027d9","category":"Tech"}
