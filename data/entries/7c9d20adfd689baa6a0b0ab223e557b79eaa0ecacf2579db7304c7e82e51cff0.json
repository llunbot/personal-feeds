But that's what happened today during the company's WWDC keynote: Apple announced a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/jrze0e\" target=\"_blank\">15-inch variant</a> of the traditionally 13-inch MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>It's a move that has been rumored for years.</p>\n<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air is in most respects identical to its 13-inch counterpart and has Apple's M2 chip. The star is the 15.3-inch screen, which has 5-mm borders and a brightness of 500 nits. Apple hasn't provided the resolution for the screen yet, but it was rumored that the 15-inch MacBook Air would have the same resolution as the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 3024×1964. The 15-inch MacBook Air will be available with up to 24GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, Apple said today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944161#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944161&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7c9d20adfd689baa6a0b0ab223e557b79eaa0ecacf2579db7304c7e82e51cff0","category":"Tech"}
