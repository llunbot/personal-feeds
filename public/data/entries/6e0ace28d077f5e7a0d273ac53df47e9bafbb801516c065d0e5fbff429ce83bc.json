The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Appel Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these “events,” and streams them live online to millions of watchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, there were three such events: A spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. An additional event was expected in October or November but never materialized. In 2023, we expect at least three Apple events and possibly four—one of which might be the debut of a whole new category of products from Apple. Read on to find out what events and new product launches Apple might have in store for 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s next event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple hasn’t officially announced its next event yet, it already announced new products in 2023: the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1509062/homepod-2023-review.html\">2nd-gen HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480091/mac-mini-m2-pro-review.html\">M2 Mac Mini</a>, the 14-inch and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480214/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-pro-review.html\">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1534034/iphone-14-plus-yellow-color-announced.html\">yellow iPhone 14</a>. While that doesn’t mean Apple isn’t planning a spring event for sometime in March or April as it has done in previous years, the odds of it happening aren’t good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent rumors suggest that Apple’s AR/VR headset, once set for a debut in the spring (with a release later this year), will now be unveiled at WWDC in June. That calls into question the entire possibility of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-2023-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring event</a>, as the only significant product Apple is expected to release before summer is a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Event far out\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1919w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Next-Apple-Event.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens at an Apple event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple holds three or four live or live-streamed events throughout the year where the company unveils its latest products and plans during a keynote address. They are usually held during similar times of the year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>March/April: Spring event</li><li>June: WWDC</li><li>September: Fall event</li><li>October: Final event</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The spring event is the least predictable event. In 2022, Apple released the iPhone SE 2, iPad Air, and Mac Studio and Studio Display, in 2021, we got the iMac, AirTag, and Apple TV 4K. And in 2019, the event was devoted to Apple’s services: Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade. The other events are more predictable, with software coming at WWDC, iPhones and Apple Watches in September, and Macs in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the next Apple event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s events usually start at 10 am PT at Apple Park in Cupertino, California. Here’s what that translates to in the countries where most of our readers live:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>US: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li><li>Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li><li>UK: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li><li>Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST)</li><li>India: at 10.30 pm (IST)</li><li>Australia: Following day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li><li>New Zealand: next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does an Apple event last?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives including Craig Federighi, John Ternus, Erin Turullols, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple events will take place in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on past history and recent rumors, here are the events we expect to see across the remainder of 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spring Event: April 2023</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the latest rumors, Apple is planning to hold a spring event in 2023. The event will most likely take place on a Monday or Tuesday in early- to mid-April. Here’s when Apple has held its last few spring events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2022: Tuesday, March 8</li><li>2021: Tuesday, April 20</li><li>2020: No event due to Covid</li><li>2019: Monday, March 25</li><li>2018: Tuesday, March 27</li><li>2017: No event</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple had been expected to unveil its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">AR headset</a> at a spring event, which would be a whole new device category for Apple. It’s expected to cost upwards of $3,000 and might not ship until the fall—though the device will be a precursor to the eventual release of wearable Apple glasses. With recent reports suggesting the unveiling has been moved back a couple months to WWDC in June, it’s not clear that Apple would have a spring event at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on the list for possible releases are a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Mac Pro</a> with Apple silicon, the last Mac that still has an Intel processor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WWDC: June 2023</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a safe bet that WWDC 23023 will happen at the beginning of June 2023. With the exception of 2020, which was delayed due to Covid, the conference has been held in the first week of June:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WWDC 2022: June 6-10</li><li>WWDC 2021: June 7-11</li><li>WWDC 2020: June 22-26</li><li>WWDC 2019: June 3-7</li><li>WWDC 2018: June 4-8</li><li>WWDC 2017: June 5-9</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The keynote will take place on a Monday, with developer events and sessions continuing throughout the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple uses WWDC each year to unveil the latest versions of its operating systems, so this year we’ll get a preview of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS 14, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17, and possibly for the first time xrOS, Apple’s mixed-reality OS. New hardware sometimes makes an appearance at WWDC as well. In 2022, Apple used the keynote to unveil the M2 chip which debuted in the 13-inch MacBook Pro and redesigned MacBook Air models.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there isn’t a spring event, the same products above are expected to appear at WWDC, especially the mixed-reality headset.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" width=\"1069\" height=\"743\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" /><figcaption>Apple launched the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro in September 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fall Event: September 2023</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple always holds an event in September where it almost always launches a new iPhone. (The only exception is 2020 due to Covid-related production issues.) Here are the past few Apple Fall Event dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2022: Wednesday, September 7<br />2021: Tuesday, September 14<br />2020: Tuesday, September 15<br />2019: Tuesday, September 10<br />2018: Wednesday, September 12<br />2017: Tuesday, September 12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are no specific rumors about the event yet, we’re expecting to see the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/new-iphone-14-2022-release-date-3808651/\">iPhone 15</a>, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1503167/iphone-15-ultra-pro-max-size-price.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a> to replace the iPhone 14 Pro Max. We’re also likely to see the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch 9</a>. And like WWDC, if Apple hasn’t yet unveiled its AR headset, the fall iPhone event is a strong contender for its debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Late fall Event: October/November 2023 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s late fall event isn’t guaranteed to happen. In 2022, for example, there were rumors about ann October event, but Apple opted to issue press releases for the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">10th-gen iPad</a> and M2 iPad Pro. Over the past six years, Apple has held three events, so it’s a 50 percent chance of happening this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2022: No event </li><li>2021: Monday, October 18</li><li>2020: Tuesday, October 12</li><li>2019: No event</li><li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li><li>2017: No event</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple traditionally uses its late fall event to unveil new Macs and iPads. In 2023, that would likely mean the launch of the M3 chip, which could appear in the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1511195/imac-apple-silicon-m2-m3-update-rumors.html\">24-inch iMac</a>, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air.</p>\n\nApple, iPad, iPhone, Mac, Personal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6e0ace28d077f5e7a0d273ac53df47e9bafbb801516c065d0e5fbff429ce83bc","category":"Apple"}
