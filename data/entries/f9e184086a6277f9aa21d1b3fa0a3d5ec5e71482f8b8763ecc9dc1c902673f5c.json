Qi2 sports a \"Magnetic Power Profile\" (MPP), created with help by Apple's MagSafe team, to help align devices and chargers' coils for faster, more efficient charging. Qi2-certified devices set onto Qi2 chargers can achieve 15 W charging, up from 7.5 W in the standard Qi scheme.</p>\n<p>That brings Qi2 devices up to the same speed as iPhones on MagSafe chargers, and it clears up some consumer confusion about how fast a device might charge on Qi, MagSafe, or proprietary chargers. Should a phone and charger be Qi2 certified, you can now expect about 15 W out of it, regardless of whatever Google, Apple, or third party is behind them. Android and iPhone users alike are no longer beholden to their primary hardware vendor if they want 15 W of wireless juice.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984102#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984102&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f9e184086a6277f9aa21d1b3fa0a3d5ec5e71482f8b8763ecc9dc1c902673f5c","category":"Tech"}
