And today it’s lower than ever: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DGJ5KQL7/\">Amazon is selling the Jet Black Apple Watch Series 10 for $373</a>, a savings of $26 off its $399 MSRP. We’ll admit that it’s not a huge discount, but it’s the best we’ve seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478899/apple-watch-series-10-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 10 review</a>, one thing is clear—Apple has perfected its smartwatch. We gave it a near-perfect score and our Editors’ Choice award, praising the larger, easier-to-read display, the refined design with a thinner enclosure and smaller Digital Crown, and its enhanced fast charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch 10 Series comes with tons of features and sensors, including heart rate, ECG, and temperature. It also has a new Vitals app for tracking your key metrics and can detect sleep apnea. Whether you’re using it for exercise, swimming, listening to music, making calls, sending texts, or keeping track of notifications, the Apple Watch Series 10 is truly a life-saving gadget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside is that the Apple Watch doesn’t have an extraordinary battery life and you’ll have to pop this one up to charge on the daily. In fact, if you’re traveling, it really wouldn’t hurt to carry around <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2491766/charge-your-apple-watch-and-iphone-on-the-go-with-20-off-this-anker-charger.html\">a power bank</a> (also on sale right now) that’s ready to charge your iPhone and your Apple Watch at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But don’t let that get you down. The Apple Watch Series 10 is a great addition to your wrist, so go grab one right now.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get a new Apple Watch on sale</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DGJ5KQL7/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"537d468a410e10d20a228dd614be4319b517be7bb4f16f99189c853281fe1fea","category":"Apple"}
