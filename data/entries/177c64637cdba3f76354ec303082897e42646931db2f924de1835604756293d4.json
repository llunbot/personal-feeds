{"title":"U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Levels by County Over Time","link":"https://acasignups.net/21/08/11/us-covid19-vaccination-levels-county-over-time","date":1628794326000,"content":"\n<p>Charles Gaba:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One thing I’ve been noting is that the R-squared (coefficient of\ndetermination) for the graphs at both the state &amp; county levels\nseems to have been inching up higher over the past month or two\n… that is, the outlier counties seem to be gradually moving\ncloser to the graph’s trend line.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the slope of the trend line seemed to be moving\nupwards as well over time. Both of these mean that not only is\nthere a clear correlation between a county’s 2020 partisan lean\nand how quickly their residents are getting vaccinated, that\ncorrelation is only increasing over time.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to check to see whether this was an anomaly (just a\ntemporary thing) or not by going back to the county-level\nvaccination data all the way back to February 1st, 2021. At that\npoint supplies of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were\nramping up, but getting vaccinated was still limited mostly to\nsenior citizens 65 and older in the United States.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The whole series of charts is telling, but the last one — the animated one that shows how the partisan divide is <em>increasing</em> over time — is startling. The vaccinated aren’t going to forget this.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/12/gaba-vaccinations-by-county-over-time\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"177c64637cdba3f76354ec303082897e42646931db2f924de1835604756293d4","category":"Tech"}
