The tweet depicts two images, one with an alleged screenshot of the new cases, while the other shows those same cases in real life.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is planning dark green, black, dark and light blue, orange, pink, (PRODUCT) RED, and white silicone case options for the ‌iPhone 13‌, according to the images.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAnother image <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1436995731349557250?s=20\">shared by the same Twitter account</a> allegedly shows the leather case collection for the ‌iPhone 13‌ series. Compared to the current ‌iPhone 12‌ leather collection, the images show minimal color changes, with the \"Baltic Blue\" case taking a more green hue. Overall, ‌iPhone 13‌ leather case color options may include black, purple, light purple, dark green, and brown.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-13-leather.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the leather and silicone cases are expected, a separate image on Weibo offers a glimpse into a possible new case design from Apple. An <a href=\"https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4681010728142428\">image shared</a> on Weibo by an account with no current track record shows a silicone case with a translucent design featuring a two-tone finish that's reminiscent of the original ‌iPhone‌ design. The cases, however, show no <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> ring, casting doubt on their legitimacy.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-13-case-two-tone-finish.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs always, these images, especially those for cases and ‌iPhone‌ accessories, must be taken with a grain of salt ahead of a new ‌iPhone‌ launch. It's also worth noting that the source of today's leather and silicone case images <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/iphone-12-spring-case-colors-leak/\">had previously shared photos</a> of unreleased ‌iPhone‌ cases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the cases in the images shared could be from Apple, they could also be third-party cases from an accessory maker or entirely fake. Apple will hold its \"California streaming\" even on Tuesday, September 14, where it's expected to reveal the ‌iPhone 13‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-7/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, and the third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/iphone-13-case-color-images-ahead-apple-event/\">Images Allegedly Show New iPhone 13 Case Colors Ahead of Apple Event</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/images-allegedly-show-new-iphone-13-case-colors-ahead-of-apple-event.2310546/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wC90b82jk3c:sGlDFQgxphg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wC90b82jk3c:sGlDFQgxphg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wC90b82jk3c\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b688dd91d71acbc24a3c7c3234d7d046bedafe7e1c2b54d130ccba6023cebda9","category":"Apple"}
