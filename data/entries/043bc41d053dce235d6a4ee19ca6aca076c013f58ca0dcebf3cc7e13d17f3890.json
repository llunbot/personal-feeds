With past X products (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/151418/22osx-brief1.html\">OS X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230697/iphone-x-review.html\">iPhone X</a>),  Apple made drastic changes that put those products in a better position for the future. It remains to be seen whether Apple will do the same for the Apple Watch Series X, but we’re starting to get glimpses of what’s in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest comes from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27119&amp;xcust=1-1-2291423-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">The Elec</a> with a report that the next Apple Watch could use a low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED display. This technology applies oxide to the switching and driving thin-film transistors (TFT). This could make the display more power-efficient, thus preserving battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch X, along with the iPhone 16, is expected to be revealed this fall. The Elec also states that Apple could use LTPO OLED display tech in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, while the standard iPhone 16 and 16 Plus could use low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) display tech. LTPO OLED tech could spread to all four models of the iPhone 17 in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features we could see in the next Apple Watch include new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2123009/apple-watch-series-10-health-features-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea.html\">health features</a>, a slimmer case, and a new magnetic attachment system for bands. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Learn more about the upcoming Apple Watch</a>.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"043bc41d053dce235d6a4ee19ca6aca076c013f58ca0dcebf3cc7e13d17f3890","category":"Apple"}
