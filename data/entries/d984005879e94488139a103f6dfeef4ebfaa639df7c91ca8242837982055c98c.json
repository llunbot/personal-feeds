The group, going by the moniker PR Puppets, claims the stunt was a protest against being asked to work as unpaid R&amp;D and bug testers while participating in \"art washing\" of AI tools. But OpenAI says participation in the early alpha test is voluntary and has no requirements that testers provide feedback.</p>\n<p>PR Puppets <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/PR-Puppets/PR-Puppet-Sora\">posted its \"Generate with Sora\" access point to Hugging Face</a> at about 8:30 Eastern time Tuesday morning, according to Git commit logs. Quickly, AI experts on social media noticed the posting and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btibor91/status/1861435635891917100\">confirmed</a> that the page connected to endpoints on OpenAI's actual Sora API and hosting on a videos.openai.com domain, presumably with authentication tokens provided to testers by OpenAI itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OMG OpenAI Sora has been leaked!</p>\n<p>Free to use now on Huggingface, link in comment</p>\n<p>It can be shut down anytime, try it now! It can generate 1080P and up to 10s video! And the results are incredible!</p>\n<p>9 Examples: <a href=\"https://t.co/rIJJv5TQTo\">pic.twitter.com/rIJJv5TQTo</a></p>\n<p>â€” el.cine (@EHuanglu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EHuanglu/status/1861446152924864908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>That access was revoked within hours, but not before <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EHuanglu/status/1861446152924864908\">plenty</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BEAST_OFFICIIAL/status/1861450783377539416\">eager</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koltregaskes/status/1861436467936985190\">followers</a> managed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/1861440503864049800\">generate their own videos</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slow_developer/status/1861440783867388298\">share them on social media</a>.
