The company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/\">had stopped advertising</a> on the social media platform in November 2023 following controversial remarks made by its owner Elon Musk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-Ad-on-X.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3177\" height=\"1787\" />\r<br />\nFor example, the @Apple account is <a href=\"https://x.com/apple/status/1889089503278813659\">running an ad</a> promoting Safari's privacy features.
