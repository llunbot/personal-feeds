Since 2015, the brand has been designing all-terrain tires for adventure and the path less traveled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we dive into how riders can optimize their bikes for different terrain — and highlight five tires from <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Teravail</strong></a> that can handle that terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Defining your riding style </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, we recommend that cyclists define their riding style, priorities, and goals before landing on a tire. To help a cyclist define their riding style, we’re putting them into three different categories: racers, explorers, and cruisers. (More on this below.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you settle on a tire for your ride, define what kind of rider you are, the terrain you’re going to be riding, and what you prioritize — speed, comfort, or versatility/durability. From there, you can hone in on products and choose the gravel tire that will suit you best. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-riding-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"871\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-riding-.jpeg\" alt=\"Teravail tires gravel riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-riding-.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-riding--297x202.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-riding--800x544.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-riding--120x82.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-riding--768x523.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Getting out for some gravel exploration. (Photo/TERAVAIL)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Racing vs. Exploration vs. Cruising </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get further into the three types of riders we named above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>racer</strong> looks to cover ground as fast as possible. Speed is the goal, and sometimes this comes at the cost of comfort, compliance, and durability. They should choose a tire that gives them the best chance of completing a course speed record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An <strong>explorer</strong>, well, explores. This could be a bikepacker or thrill-seeking gravel rider who gets off the beaten path, into the woods, through mud, down some steeps — you name it. This type of rider should choose a tire that will perform on all sorts of terrain and rugged trails without risking flats, falls, or loss of air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>cruiser</strong> takes a more utilitarian approach to their bicycle. This type of rider might crank a few miles to work in the morning, then throw on the spandex and crush 20-plus miles on pavement or gravel in the afternoon. A cruiser should choose a tire that can do it all — something that can make the commute, keep up with the peloton on pavement, and be ready for adventure when it’s time to hit the dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understanding terrain </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before selecting a tire, a cyclist should take inventory of their chosen terrain or course. This will optimize their performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pavement and hardpack trails are more predictable terrain types with fewer hazards. These types of courses don’t demand a tire with too much durability or tread. So when prioritizing speed, riders can generally opt for a tire that’s lighter-weight and slick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel roads fall between paved/hardpack and rocky off-road trails. For a gravel road, you might get the best performance out of a tire with decent width, tread, and durability. You’ll want something that provides traction, but you probably don’t need a tire on the XC-MTB end of the spectrum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For rocky trails, muddy trails, or pure exploration, a beefed-up tire with rigid sidewalls and good mud shedding is your best bet for a successful ride. You want a tire that will grip the terrain, handle hazards, and provide stability through loose or wet sections of trail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are scenarios and trail types outside the three general terrain types we’ve listed. But the demands of the ride ahead will tell you what to look for in a tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for in a tire </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Three key considerations when you’re choosing a tire are tread, width, and construction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, <strong>tread</strong> refers to the design patterns on a tire that come into contact with the road, and they directly correlate to traction, control, and stability. Riders should opt for different tire treads to optimize their performance on different terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re riding on pavement or hardpack, a tire with smoother center tread will create a low rolling resistance and more surface area contact for better traction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you’re riding rough, rocky, muddy, or loose sand trails, a wider tire with a more aggressive tread pattern and larger tread knobs — the raised rubber elements on the tire — is the better choice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, <strong>width</strong> is another differentiating factor in tire design that contributes to stability, speed, and comfort. Thinner tires are lighter but may sacrifice durability and traction. Wider tires are heavier, but what they lack in light weight they make up in traction, stability, and comfort. Additionally, wider tires tend to have a more substantial construction, which generally results in greater durability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the <strong>construction</strong> of a tire will determine puncture resistance, weight, and longevity. Cyclists riding on pavement or hardpack that prioritize speed might opt for a lightweight tire with less rolling resistance, whereas cyclists taking on more variable terrain will be less concerned with weight and favor durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Teravail</strong></a> offers two tire casings: Durable bead-to-bead and Light &amp; Supple. Durable bead-to-bead is the more robust composition, with a woven nylon layer in the sidewall and tread cap to protect the tire against punctures, abrasions, and lacerations. Light &amp; Supple will roll more comfortably and weigh less, but it offers less puncture protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/articles/whats-in-a-tire-all-about-casings-and-compounds-pg1233.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Durable</a> casing is a better choice for those riding and exploring gravel that’s more varied and challenging. If you know the terrain you’re riding is rugged with side wall-cutting rocks, it’s best to be equipped with a thicker casing to avoid flat tires. The <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/articles/whats-in-a-tire-all-about-casings-and-compounds-pg1233.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Durable</a> option is still fast rolling and could work well for ultra-endurance or adventure riding, providing a bit more insurance against any hazardous terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Combo-Image_Crop-700x295-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Combo-Image_Crop-700x295-1.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Combo-Image_Crop-700x295-1.jpg 700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Combo-Image_Crop-700x295-1-297x125.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Combo-Image_Crop-700x295-1-120x51.jpg 120w\" /></a><figcaption>Light casing construction (Photo/TERAVAIL)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Teravail Gravel Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we get into the nitty-gritty of five <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Teravail</strong></a> tires you might want to consider for your gravel setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Teravail Rampart</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-rampart-tire-394763-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Teravail Rampart</strong></a> is a dry-condition and mainly road or pavement tire. The tread is minimal, but it packs in more volume than most pure road tires. According to the brand, this tire is at home on decaying pavement, hardpacked dirt, and light gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The center tread is smooth and fast-rolling for wide open roads and pavement. As you move to the side of the tire, the lugs have 3-2-1 siping for traction on all road surfaces and weather conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those looking to maximize efficiency, the <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-rampart-tire-394763-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rampart</strong></a> comes in both Durable and Light &amp; Supple casings. Both options have the same tread (or lack thereof), but the Durable casing has an extra protective layer to stave off cuts and flats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rampart Details</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Designed for: Pavement, cobbles, and classics style terrain</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Casing: 60 tpi folding-bead\n<ul>\n<li>Available in Durable or Light &amp; Supple options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Available with Black or Tan sidewalls</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tubeless-compatible </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-rampart-riding-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-rampart-riding--800x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Teravail tires gravel rampart riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-rampart-riding--800x480.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-rampart-riding--297x178.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-rampart-riding--120x72.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-rampart-riding--768x461.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-rampart-riding-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>The Teravail Rampart.

Teravail designed the Washburn to provide extra traction while cornering and help a rider maintain speed on flats, pavement, or hardpack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lugs are tightly spaced toward the center of the tire and gradually become more spaced out toward the sidewall. This lug style helps keep riders upright on the road without fading too aggressively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-washburn-tire-384009-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Washburn</strong></a> is a tire to consider for rides with mixed terrain — perhaps some pavement blended with back road gravel exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Washburn Details</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Designed for: Adventure racing/riding with equal parts pavements and dirt</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Casing: 60 tpi folding-bead\n<ul>\n<li>Available in Durable or Light &amp; Supple options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Available with Black or Tan sidewalls</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tubeless-compatible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravelwashburn-tread-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravelwashburn-tread--800x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Teravail tires gravelwashburn tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravelwashburn-tread--800x480.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravelwashburn-tread--297x178.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravelwashburn-tread--120x72.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravelwashburn-tread--768x461.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravelwashburn-tread-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Teravail Cannonball</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When Teravail designed the <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-cannonball-tire-394759-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cannonball</strong></a>, its aim was to make the Swiss Army knife of gravel tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-cannonball-tire-394759-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cannonball</strong></a> offers a balanced blend of durability, traction, and speed. The center lugs are raised and ramped for efficient rolling, and the diamond-shaped lugs squeeze in for grip as they contact dirt, then back out to shed debris. And the side and shoulder transition lugs are spaced and vary in height to boost traction and confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sees the addition of L-shaped side lugs, which are typical in cyclocross tires. The Cannonball digs in for grip while braking through corners but rolls quickly when a rider lets off the brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ethos of the <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-cannonball-tire-394759-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cannonball</strong></a> is all-around gravel. It will perform well on most surfaces, claims the brand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cannonball Details</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Designed for: Classic gravel, limestone, mixed terrain </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Casing: 60 tpi folding-bead\n<ul>\n<li>Available in Durable or Light &amp; Supple options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Available with Black or Tan sidewalls</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tubeless-compatible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-Cannonball-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-Cannonball--800x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Teravail tires gravel Cannonball\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-Cannonball--800x480.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-Cannonball--297x178.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-Cannonball--120x72.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-Cannonball--768x461.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-Cannonball-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>The Teravail Cannonball (Photo/TERAVAIL)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Teravail Sparwood</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-sparwood-tire-394764-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Teravail Sparwood</strong></a> is a spring gravel tire with a fast-rolling tread that can mix it up in some mud and thick, heavy, wet gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial idea of the <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-sparwood-tire-394764-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sparwood</strong></a> was a long-distance, mixed-terrain tire, but it succeeded as a gravel race tire because of the similarities in those disciplines, according to the brand. Its design aims for a hard-charging tread with rolling efficiency mixed with durability and the ability to shed mud when the road hits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread of the <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-sparwood-tire-394764-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sparwood</strong></a> is a slightly raised, tightly spaced center line tread that is ramped for a better rolling economy. Unlike the Cannonball, the <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-sparwood-tire-394764-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sparwood</strong></a> uses diamond- and chevron-shaped transition lugs. The diamond-shaped lugs on the side and shoulder give a predictable grip that sheds dirt, says Teravail. Paired with L-shaped knobs for braking stability, the <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-sparwood-tire-394764-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sparwood</strong></a> is a slightly more aggressive tread than the Cannonball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sparwood Details </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Designed for: Classic gravel course, chunky terrain with rocks, slightly wet, saturated terrain</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Casing: 60 tpi folding-bead\n<ul>\n<li>Available in Durable or Light &amp; Supple options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Available with Black or Tan sidewalls</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tubeless-compatible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-sparwood-on-bike-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-sparwood-on-bike--800x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Teravail tires gravel sparwood on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-sparwood-on-bike--800x480.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-sparwood-on-bike--297x178.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-sparwood-on-bike--120x72.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-sparwood-on-bike--768x461.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Teravail-tires-gravel-sparwood-on-bike-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>The Teravail Sparwood (Photo/TERAVAIL)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Teravail Rutland</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.teravail.com/product/teravail-rutland-tire-419816-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Teravail Rutland</strong></a> is built to tackle the gnarliest of terrain, according to the brand.
