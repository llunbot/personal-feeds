The brand claims it has bench-tested the seals to an altitude of 12,000m.</p>\n<p>A 2.5mm hex key and a T10 Torx key are included to suit both Shimano and SRAM bleed ports.</p>\n<p>There’s also a guide on how to use the kit, but the process is much like how you would <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-bleed-shimano-disc-brakes/\">burp-bleed Shimano disc brakes</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You get a 2.5mm hex and T10 Torx key in the box.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Neutron Components says it’s best to only use the tool with one type of brake fluid. Mineral and DOT fluid are not cross-compatible with one another. If you switch between brake fluids, make sure you scrupulously clean the bleed kit first with isopropyl alcohol.</p>\n<p>The tool isn’t compatible with Shimano road or gravel, SRAM DB8 or Magura brakes, because they use different thread sizes (although you can use an adaptor for the former).</p>\n<p>The kit retails for NZ$49, which converts to roughly £24.50/$31.50/€28/AU$45.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Neutron Components Emergency Bleed Kit impressions</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Emergency Bleed Kit functions just like a Shimano bleed bucket.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I tested the Neutron Emergency Bleed Kit on a couple of bikes with spongy-feeling levers.</p>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how well the kit performed – it works exactly as described.</p>\n<p>Crucially, the kit seems to be fully waterproof. I dunked a filled kit in a glass of water and couldn’t detect any air bubbles escaping. That said, you’ll probably want to change the seals from time to time because seals can swell over time, particularly if you’re storing DOT fluid.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This Shimano XTR M9100 brake felt much better after a burp-bleed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I burp-bled a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/shimano-xtr-m9100-brakes-review/\">Shimano XTR M9100 brake </a>on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-2022-lux-world-cup/\">Canyon Lux World Cup</a>, managing to eke a couple of rogue air bubbles out of the system and the brake felt noticeably firmer.</p>\n<p>I thought the supplied hex keys would be throwaway items, but I was pleasantly surprised by their quality.</p>\n<p>The keys were hard enough to avoid rounding the Shimano lever bleed ports screws, which are often as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bleed-screw-y0mx98020/\">strong as soft cheese</a>.</p>\n<p>Things are a little different when it comes to SRAM brakes. You’d very rarely (if ever) burp-bleed a SRAM brake because, unlike Shimano’s bleeding process, you push and pull between the two syringes to remove air bubbles and pressurise the system.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tapping on the hose encourages any air bubbles up to the surface.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As a result, using the Emergency Bleed Kit to burp bleed a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/sram-code-rsc-brake-review/\">SRAM Code RSC</a> made a minimal difference to the lever feel.</p>\n<p>You’ll want to carry a rag that can get rid of any fluid that leaks, particularly DOT because it’s corrosive on paint.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I’d rate this Emergency Bleed Kit over Shimano’s bleed bucket.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Is the Emergency Bleed Kit worth taking on your next <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking-routes/\">bikepacking trip</a>?
