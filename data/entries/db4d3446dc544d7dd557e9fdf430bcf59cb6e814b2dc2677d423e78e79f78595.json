It's pitched mostly at developers and games media, but John Buckley also wants players to let go of the \"dead game\" mentality.</p>\n<p>\"Who cares if there's only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don't think it needs to be any more complex than that,\" Buckley said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO38QvKraTQ\">an interview on the Going Indie YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>The people at <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair, in particular, would have reason for panic, if they subscribed to the mentality that active online players are the key benchmark for modern gaming.
