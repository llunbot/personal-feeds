Kuo said production issues related to the titanium frame, display panels, batteries, and a new stacked camera sensor for the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have all been resolved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo corroborated previously-rumored color options for the Pro models, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/apple-iphone-15-pro-colors/\">gray, silver/white, black, and blue</a>. Notably, this means the highest-end iPhones would not be available in gold for the first time since the iPhone X. He said the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will be available in black, pink, yellow, blue, and green.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo also reiterated that the iPhone 15 Pro Max was the last new model to enter mass production, so this device may have the tightest supply at launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models are expected to be equipped with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island, while several other new features are rumored for the Pro models, including a faster A17 Bionic chip, a customizable Action button, Wi-Fi 6E support, and more. The devices should be available to pre-order a few days after Apple's event on September 12.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/kuo-iphone-15-colors-and-more/\">Kuo on iPhone 15: New Colors, Production Issues Resolved, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-on-iphone-15-new-colors-production-issues-resolved-and-more.2400024/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bff12fd54352208f5b5e59be86ca213e4c58aab889a302b1cfc8d6edc515ff95","category":"Apple"}
