Wagering that the terrain would be smoother on the TDR than the double track he traversed in Mexico, instead of a suspension fork, he made a truss fork that was arguably more complex than the frame itself, requiring more brazing in tighter spots. The truss fork is the standout feature of the bike, so let’s look at the front end first.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-54a.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-54a.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-54a.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-54a.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-54a.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-55.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-58.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-58.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-58.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-58.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-58.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<h3>Front End</h3>\n<p>The truss fork was sculpted with chromoly tubing and fillet-brazed connections. By building a fork with smaller diameter tubing and increasing its strength by passing the dynamic load across the primary and secondary structural members, the ride quality is smooth like a steel fork and is engineered to withstand any aberrant load from impact, even under the extra weight of a handlebar bag.</p>\n<p>When we spoke about this piece, Brian added the following note about why he chose the truss fork design over a traditional fork:</p>\n<p><em>“One of the other advantages of the truss fork I forgot to mention is that it uses a removable steerer tube clamped into place above and below the head tube. Because it isn’t brazed in, I can use a much lighter material for the steerer, in this case, an aluminum tapered steerer, which keeps the weight much lower than a steel steerer.”</em></p>\n<p>It would be very hard to break a truss fork. Yet there are more benefits, aside from durability, to incorporating one on a touring bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-39.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>One such benefit is integrating a cargo rack into the front member of the truss.

His chainring was chosen for a 2:1 singlespeed setup, and Brian noted that he could have opted for a smaller ring in hindsight for the extra gear inches while climbing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-32.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>His entire drivetrain is pretty cooked from the mud and rain, but it got him down the route without issue.

Yet, Brian had very few mechanical issues, save for the Yokozuna calipers, which required a lot of maintenance on the road.

Brian noted that he saw a lot of wheel damage on the course, with many people busting spokes. Meanwhile, he noted a subtle softening of the ride quality in his wheels and the fact that he barely had to maintain them over the course of entire route. While documenting the bike, I noticed but one spoke head that had been backed off and one that had been turned in. Meanwhile, the Kevlar fabric spokes barely look worn and would honestly be good for another Tour Divide!</p>\n<p><em>If you’re interested in a long-form review of Berd, written by Kyle Klain and Dr. Kim Klain, check out our review here: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/spoke-too-soon-an-in-depth-review-of-berd-spokes/\" target=\"_blank\">Spoke Too Soon: An In-Depth Review of BERD Spokes</a></em></p>\n<p>Once again, if something lasts the length of the TDR, it’s probably stout enough for anything you’ll ride on a day-to-day basis!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Brian-and-His-Rare-Earth-Cycle-Craft-Tour-Divide-Bike-52.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Cyclotourist Portraits</h3>\n<p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, bike touring changes people. It hones your equipment and sharpens one’s personality. While routes like the Tour Divide might not be for everyone, there’s something to be said for self-contained travel by bicycle. Whether an overnighter or a weekender, strapping all your stuff to your stuff and pedaling off into the forest, desert, or plains is liberating and soul-shaping.</p>\n<p>Catching up with Brian, less than 24 hours after his completed Tour Divide, has been a highlight of this summer and perhaps next time he rolls through town, he’ll have some fresh legs for some of our day rides here. So far I’ve only hung out with him after painfully long efforts! I wish Brian and his family safe travels and a speedy recovery.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rareearth_cycle/\" target=\"_blank\">Rare Earth Cycle Craft</a> for a build queue.
