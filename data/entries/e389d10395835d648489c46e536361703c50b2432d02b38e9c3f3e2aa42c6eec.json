CyclingTips does not suggest that there was any wrongdoing on the part of any of the brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“By acquiring a specialty bike company, a high-margin helmet company and a design savvy Italian clothing company [De Marchi], OCP can leverage its marketing, analytics and logistics expertise without compromising the individual brands,” a 2020 executive summary from OCP said, also claiming that De Rosa would become “the only real alternative to Canyon (a €400m German Company) in the Road Bicycle DTC space.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A pattern of deception</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an increasingly elaborate sequence of deceptions, according to the plaintiffs, Mancini forged bank statements on numerous occasions to deflect questions from investors in the fund. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mancini also falsely told investors that their funds would be used to purchase stock from Limar, with the money instead either funnelled off to Mancini and his wife – a co-defendent in the case – or to make “Ponzi-like” payments to other investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-giro-ditalia-stage-16-kramon-11-1340x894.jpg\" /><figcaption>Limar is the helmet sponsor of Astana-Premier Tech, their wares expertly modelled by Aleksandr Vlasov in action against Dani Martínez (Ineos Grenadiers) at the 2021 Giro d’Italia.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mancini allegedly told his investors that he had invested millions of dollars of his own money in the acquisitions – according to <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2021/07/26/director-cycling-investment-fund-arrested-charged-securities-fraud#.YQKS-xMzYWo\">one account</a>, US$9.4 million. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC charges that this was a lie. “Mancini never invested any appreciable amount of money in the fund, either directly or as trustee of any trust,” the complaint reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mancini also targeted alumni from the prestigious West Point Military Academy as investors, representing himself as a fellow graduate – but failing to disclose that he himself had never graduated, leaving the academy early due to an ethics breach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mancini’s web of deception has ensnared various other longstanding cycling industry figures, not least those who worked at Outdoor Capital Partners alongside him. These include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Andrew Herrick (managing director alongside Mancini): a co-founder of Pedro’s, former VP Global Brand for GT Bicycles, former CEO of Crankbrothers, and former CEO of Intense Cycles. </li><li>Eric Horton (head of product): A cycling industry veteran who is a former Head of Design at Giro, and worked on footwear and bike graphic design for Specialized </li><li>Michelle VanGilder: Formerly of crankbrothers and Selle Royal Group, and a purchasing manager at Felt Bicycles. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All three individuals were listed on OCP’s website under ‘team members’ as of last week, but the website <a href=\"https://outdoorcapitalpartners.com/our-team\">has since been updated</a> to show Mancini as the sole employee. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The New Jersey criminal complaint references an unnamed “co-conspirator 1” – a co-CEO and co-managing director; presumably Herrick – but does not charge this individual with any crimes as Mancini was the sole signatory on most of the company’s bank accounts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric Horton, meanwhile, told Bicycle Retailer &amp; Industry News that he was “devastated by the allegations”, with an unnamed OCP team member saying that “we are victims in this just as much as anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dodged bullets</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a sliding doors moment, CyclingTips can report that in late 2018, Mancini and OCP made a pitch to acquire Pocket Outdoor Media – a media group that at the time included VeloNews, Competitor.com, Triathlete, VeloPress and Women’s Running. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That deal fell through, and Pocket Outdoor Media was finally acquired by tech entrepreneur Robin Thurston in 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pocket Outdoor Media then purchased Outside Magazine, with the group itself then rebranding to Outside – which acquired CyclingTips this month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CyclingTips has approached various parties for comment – including De Rosa Cycles, Sam Mancini, Andrew Herrick, and other former OCP staff – but did not receive any response by time of publication. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mancini was arrested in Denver and has since been released on US$100,000 bail. The criminal case against him could result in up to 20 years in prison for each of the securities and wire fraud charges, and up to 10 years in prison for a money laundering charge. The SEC’s civil case could lead to the recovery of stolen assets, and could result in Mancini being blacklisted as an officer of a public company.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that’s happening: Limar, De Rosa, De Marchi, Cinelli, Columbus and VeloNews are likely breathing a big sigh of relief. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/de-rosa-and-limar-caught-up-in-multi-million-dollar-ponzi-scheme/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e389d10395835d648489c46e536361703c50b2432d02b38e9c3f3e2aa42c6eec","category":"Cycling"}
