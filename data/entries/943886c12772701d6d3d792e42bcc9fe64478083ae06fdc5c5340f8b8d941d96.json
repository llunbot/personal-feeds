This is the fully reusable launch vehicle Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, says is crucial to his vision of establishing a settlement on Mars. In the nearer term, once Starship is flight proven, SpaceX plans to use the rocket to launch massive payloads of numerous Starlink Internet satellites. NASA has a pair of contracts with SpaceX worth more than $4 billion to use a variant of Starship to land astronauts on the Moon. Private space travelers have also signed up to fly on Starship.</p>\n<p>But those ambitions hinge on getting Starship into orbit, which hasn't happened yet. The flight profile for Saturday's test launch, designated Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2), should have taken the unpiloted Starship on a trajectory to fly most of the way around the world before a targeted reentry and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. In the end, the rocket didn't reach this objective, but the results Saturday were promising.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985247#p3\">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985247&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"943886c12772701d6d3d792e42bcc9fe64478083ae06fdc5c5340f8b8d941d96","category":"Tech"}
