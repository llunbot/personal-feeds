However, a report last week from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/\">claimed</a> a new HomePod with display is expected to launch after WWDC 2025, likely in the third quarter of the year (a shift from Kuo's earlier prediction of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/\">2024 release</a>). Kuo said he also believes Tianma will be the panel supplier, but he did not mention that it would be an OLED panel. Until now, the going assumption was that a new HomePod would use a lower-quality <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/alleged-homepod-display-component/\">LCD panel</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new HomePod will reportedly emphasize smart home functionality more than current models, suggesting a strategic repositioning of the product line. The idea that Apple is aggressively targeting the smart home market follows a recent report by Gurman about Apple developing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">all-in-one home management hub</a> with a square-shaped display, thick bezels, and a hemispherical base similar to the iMac G4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInitial shipment expectations for the new HomePod are relatively modest, with Kuo forecasting approximately 500,000 units in the second half of 2025.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/oled-homepod-launching-next-year/\">New HomePod to Reportedly Feature 6-7 Inch OLED Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-homepod-to-reportedly-feature-6-7-inch-oled-display.2444949/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8597439b21a1b88057bfbca02651c67801eba62e0ff805ec35bf219be5f8b31c","category":"Apple"}
