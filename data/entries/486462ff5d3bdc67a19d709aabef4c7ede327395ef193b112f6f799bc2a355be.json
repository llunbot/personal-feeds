Moments after a full-tilt bunch sprint, Tour of Guangxi competitors douse themselves in bottles of water in the 30°C mid-October weather. At the nearby podium, Chinese dragon dancers jump acrobatically, moving their fierce yellow-and-red puppet along while the crowd of roadside spectators requests selfies – and a few more unexpected things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Brother, smoking, smoking?’ a friendly local says, offering a pack of cigarettes to Israel-Premier Tech sprinter Riley Pickrell. The Canadian declines politely before giving <em>Cyclist</em> his verdict on the Tour of Guangxi: ‘It’s kind of nuts.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Not like other tours</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2017 the Tour of Guangxi has taken over from Il Lombardia as the final WorldTour race of the season, and it is a long way from that race in terms of both distance and setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no team buses here – riders sit in white tents pre-stage, protected from the sun’s rays – and no painted encouragement on the roads (even an ‘Allez Xi Jinping’ probably wouldn’t be tolerated here, given how the Chinese government feels about freedom of expression).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tour of Guangxi\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Massimo Fulgenzi / Spring Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Each team has a translator helping with everything from logistics to the coffee shop run. At the hotel buffets many competitors opt for tuna instead of local meat; no point playing Chinese checkers with their guts or anti-doping test results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grand Tour challengers and Monument winners are thin on the ground at this race, which takes place in southeastern China, right on Vietnam’s doorstep. The most recognisable names are former Milan-San Remo winner Jasper Stuyven, sprinter Fabio Jakobsen and Chris Froome. (ProCyclingStats rates the race 70th on the calendar in terms of start list quality, just behind the Trofeo Laigueglia.) WorldTour teams Groupama-FDJ and Alpecin-Deceuninck have skipped the race altogether.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tour of Guangxi\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Massimo Fulgenzi / Spring Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I wouldn’t say you put your hand up for it, but at the same time it’s not a bad thing,’ says Australian rider Lucas Hamilton of Jayco-AlUla. ‘This is a part of the world I never thought I’d see much of, so it’s a good chance to come here. It’s the beauty of cycling.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the race heads north into the Duyang mountains after an opening circuit race around Fangchenggang, the bunch rolls past sugar cane fields and bamboo plantations, silhouetted by wooded karst limestone mountains. It’s like a cycling race going on in a <em>King Kong</em> landscape, a far cry from the smoggy skies and polluted air that blighted China’s previous WorldTour race, the Tour of Beijing.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-cycling-koers-museum-flanders\">A history of cycling in 6 objects at the Koers Museum, Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/copenhagen-city-of-bikes\">What makes Copenhagen the world’s most bike-friendly city?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/middle-east-cycling-investment\">Follow the money: What does Middle East investment mean for cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Going big for growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Chinese adventure came about from a 2016 deal between the UCI and Wanda Group, the multinational conglomerate chaired by Chinese billionaire Wang Jialin.

Considering the immense resources and collective drive that could be devoted to the sport in China, there’s no reason to doubt that the country could produce a Grand Tour winner at some point in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undoubtedly, China possesses growth potential – bike maker Van Rysel is one of the Tour of Guangxi’s secondary sponsors (its owner, Decathlon, plans to open 20 to 30 stores annually in China over the next two years) and carbon product manufacturer XDS Carbon Tech is the new headline sponsor for Astana in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, however, as a flagship race in a country still lacking a developed cycling culture, the Tour of Guangxi is a drop in a vast ocean.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tour of Guangxi\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Stage 2 is eventually won by 23-year-old Belgian Warre Vangheluwe (Soudal–QuickStep).</figcaption><figcaption>Massimo Fulgenzi / Spring Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In terms of friendliness, though, the people in one of China’s poorest provinces are peerless. At one dinner in remote Bama, <em>Cyclist</em> and two other journalists have to put down our chopsticks to take over a hundred selfies with the townspeople. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be nice to believe this is because of the popularity of <em>Cyclist</em> in China, but it’s really just the sheer rarity of seeing Westerners. This is a taste of what it must feel like to be Tadej Pogačar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You’re a bit like a zoo animal here,’ one pro rider says.

Stage 3 sees a 20-rider pile-up, with riders going down at 70kmh on rain-slicked tarmac. Six riders abandon and the race is paused so that ambulances tracking the race can rejoin. The incident belies the race’s overzealous safety focus. Specially selected paid volunteers in red caps – some from the localities, others designated or government staff – line the road every 50 metres, whether in cities or the middle of nowhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This precaution is the result of cautious local government and police. On occasion, there are three layers of barriers – one immediately by the route, then a layer of police tape then another metal barrier, keeping regular townspeople ten metres back from the action at times.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tour of Guangxi\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The peloton rumbles on towards the finish of the final stage.

And failure is a problem in Chinese culture.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the race’s numerous sprints, Stage 5’s 4km finishing climb on Nongla, with pitches at 11%, is a serious decider. To the metronomic pounding of 30 Zhuang folk drummers at the top of the hill, Lotto-Dstny <em>puncheur</em> Lennert Van Eetvelt puts down some of his best career power numbers to outsprint eventual runner-up Onley. The race is a happy hunting ground for motivated young riders chasing ranking points: four of the race’s five stage winners are under 25, as well as the top three overall finishers.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tour of Guangxi\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/tour-of-guangxi-11.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Massimo Fulgenzi / Spring Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Playing to the crowd</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few venerable greats alongside the whippersnappers too.

Whereas here, just look around,’ he says, gesturing at the 20 fans waiting to have their moment with the British legend. ‘There’s much more of a cycling culture now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The hotels have been amazing, really comfortable. It definitely puts into context the ones we’re used to in Europe,’ he adds. ‘I didn’t know what to expect before coming here.

His role started in spring 2016 when Swiss sports events company Infront was contracted to make the race happen. Senn has since taken it on with his own agency, ProTouchGlobal, and brings his own team over. It stands to reason that the ones making the race run like clockwork are Swiss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s just so different; the contrasts are so crazy,’ says Senn. ‘There are these big modern cities like Nanning. You go around one hill and you’re in the countryside, with farmers and their bulls pulling wooden carts with bamboo on the back.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been both a learning experience and a teaching one, educating Chinese colleagues who were unfamiliar with the sport. At first, for instance, local TV production staff wanted to put a camera in the middle of the finishing straights with mats around it. Senn, who also directs the Tour de Suisse, made it clear that was a no-no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a supplier, Senn’s influence has limits. The local government decides the host cities and locations, and they are not always advantageous to sporting drama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The last stage in Nanning, I told them to put the finish 5km after the downhill [of the circuit’s steep climb]. But now it’s 15km of flat to the finish because they want it to end next to the Cultural Centre. I can try to explain the sporting side, but to them that’s not the most important thing. They want to showcase the countryside and have a big sporting event in the province. They don’t really understand how cycling works.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may gradually change. Televised on national broadcaster CCTV and with more than 110 million total views on TikTok, the Tour of Guangxi is gaining eyeballs in China. The race is a way to showcase Guangxi as a tourist and cycling destination. There is early promise, with a mass participation ride in Nanning held on the last day attracting almost 1,000 participants.
