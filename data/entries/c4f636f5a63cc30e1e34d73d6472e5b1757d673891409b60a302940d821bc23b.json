One object of study is a warming event known as the Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO) from about 17 to 15 million years ago. It coincided with floods of basalt lava that covered a large area of the Northwestern US, creating what are called the “Columbia River Basalts.” This timing suggests that <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL096519\">volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> was the cause</a> of the warming.</p>\n<p>Those eruptions were the most recent example of a “Large Igneous Province,” a phenomenon that has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/when-will-the-earth-try-to-kill-us-again/\">repeatedly triggered climate upheavals</a> and mass extinctions throughout Earth’s past. The Miocene version was relatively benign; it saw <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aba6853\">CO<sub>2</sub> levels</a> and global temperatures rise, causing <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018218308332\">ecosystem changes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X24002577\">significant melting of Antarctic ice,</a> but didn’t trigger a mass extinction.</p>\n<p>A paper <a href=\"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52255.1/645502/High-precision-U-Pb-geochronology-for-the-Miocene\">just published in Geology</a>, led by <a href=\"https://carnegiescience.edu/dr-jennifer-kasbohm\">Jennifer Kasbohm</a> of the Carnegie Science’s Earth and Planets Laboratory, upends the idea that the eruptions triggered the warming while still blaming them for the <em>peak</em> climate warmth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047424#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047424&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Howard Lee","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c4f636f5a63cc30e1e34d73d6472e5b1757d673891409b60a302940d821bc23b","category":"Tech"}
