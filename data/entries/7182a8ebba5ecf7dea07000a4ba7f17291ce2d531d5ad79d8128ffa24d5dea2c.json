Between Wednesday and Thursday, Bluesky doubled its user base, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/how-to-get-a-bluesky-invite-code-aoc-dril-teigen-join-twitter-s-hottest-rival\">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>\n<p>The surge in Bluesky's popularity came as some of Twitter's most influential users began joining Bluesky, including writer-comedian Dril, United States Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and filmmaker James Gunn. Some of these influencers may have been seeking to distance themselves from Twitter after the platform gifted many legacy accounts with blue verified badges that falsely labeled the accounts as paid subscribers.</p>\n<p>Still in beta testing, Bluesky is currently available to more than 40,000 users, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber told Bloomberg today. There's much more interest from users, though. The iPhone app has been downloaded approximately 360,000 times, and the Android app is reportedly a top download after only recently launching in the US, the United Kingdom, and Japan.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935427#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935427&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7182a8ebba5ecf7dea07000a4ba7f17291ce2d531d5ad79d8128ffa24d5dea2c","category":"Tech"}
