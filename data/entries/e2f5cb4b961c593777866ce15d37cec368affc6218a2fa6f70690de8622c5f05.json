Cooke, a brawny former athlete, is on team ‘Brains’. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRdU3CVlv6i/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRdU3CVlv6i/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Baden Cooke (@baden_cooke)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Three episodes in, that seems a safer place to be. Team Brawn struggled at the universal survival basic of ‘making fire’, and fielded a contestant that didn’t even pack a jacket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, an Instagram crochet identity is the only member of Team Brains to be sent packing thus far. Team Brains may have fire, but that’s not the only thing raging: in episode two, Cooke butted heads with teammate George, labelling him both “delusional” and “the fifth-strongest guy”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also tussled with Australian Football League legend Gavin Wanganeen (Team Brawn, voted out in a brutal tribal council, RIP).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRgbFlslaXJ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRgbFlslaXJ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Baden Cooke (@baden_cooke)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Cooke, 42, had a 13-year pro career, most prominently as a rider for Française des Jeux in the early 2000s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2003 he won a stage of the <a href=\"http://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a>. That year, he also <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-07-28/cooke-roasts-mcewen-on-tours-thin-green-line/1455928\">won the green jersey competition</a> after a sustained battle with fellow Australian Robbie McEwen, finally snatching it back off his shoulders in the final sprint on the Champs-Élysées.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After stints with UniBet.com, Barloworld, Vacansoleil, and SaxoBank, Cooke’s swansong was two years with Australian team Orica-GreenEdge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After retiring as a professional cyclist, Cooke retained ties with the sport, working as a rider agent, and as a co-owner of Factor bikes. As of June 2021 he is also the sales director at a <a href=\"https://www.hamiltoncooke.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity firm</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Australian is not the first ex-cyclist to find later-era fame on reality television. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>US mountain biker Gretchen Reeves appeared in the Amazon Prime series Eco-Challenge Fiji, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/03/the-sins-of-mario-cipollini/\">alleged domestic abuser Mario Cipollini</a> had a stint on <em>Ballando con Le Stelle</em> – Italy’s Dancing With The Stars – and Michael Rasmussen did the same with the Danish version of the franchise. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/tour-green-jersey-winner-baden-cooke-is-competing-on-survivor/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e2f5cb4b961c593777866ce15d37cec368affc6218a2fa6f70690de8622c5f05","category":"Cycling"}
