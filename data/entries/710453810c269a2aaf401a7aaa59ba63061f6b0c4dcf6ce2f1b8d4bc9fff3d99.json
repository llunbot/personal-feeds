They also drop support for the iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3 alongside the sixth-generation iPod touch. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods/compare/\">footnotes</a> for the new AirPods‌ explain why, stating that some of the features require iOS 13, which none of the above-listed devices support. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Some features require iOS 13 or iPadOS, which are not compatible with iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPod touch (6th generation), iPad Air (1st generation), iPad mini 3, and iPad mini 2. Audio Sharing not supported.</blockquote>The new third-generation AirPods are being offered alongside the second-generation AirPods, as well as the higher-end AirPods Pro. The new AirPods are available for pre-order today and will begin shipping next week. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2021-apple-event/\">October 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/third-generation-airpods-device-support/\">Third-Generation AirPods Require iOS 13, Drop Support for Older iPhones, iPads, and iPods</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/third-generation-airpods-require-ios-13-drop-support-for-older-iphones-ipads-and-ipods.2317691/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yZNpkeCrepg:wEr0Zd8FjV0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yZNpkeCrepg:wEr0Zd8FjV0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/yZNpkeCrepg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"710453810c269a2aaf401a7aaa59ba63061f6b0c4dcf6ce2f1b8d4bc9fff3d99","category":"Apple"}
