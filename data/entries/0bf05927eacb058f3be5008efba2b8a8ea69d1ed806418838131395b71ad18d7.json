SRAM claims this results in a quicker, easier setup.</p>\n<p>The skid plates, outer parallelogram link, and the tool-free cage and clutch can all be swapped between any tier of Transmission groupset and, in the case of the cage and clutch, can be upgraded if you wish.</p>\n<p>The inner part of the derailleur cage is steel, rather than aluminium as found in its more expensive siblings. This saves costs and adds some weight, but is also claimed to be more durable.</p>\n<p>Individually, the rear derailleur will cost £430/$400/€480</p>\n<h2>GX Eagle Transmission crankset</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723026\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723026\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The crankset maintains the 28.99mm DUB spindle and X-SYNC chainring of X0 Eagle Transmission groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The GX Transmission crankset uses a different design and construction compared to its more expensive stablemates.</p>\n<p>Like X0 Transmission, it’s forged from aluminium but doesn’t feature the eye-catching polished finish and hollow-arm design.</p>\n<p>Instead, it has a recessed crank-arm face, which should help keep them looking tidy and scuff-free in the long run.</p>\n<p>As with the other Transmission groupsets, the cranks have a 55mm chainline for an improved chain angle when combined with the T-Type cassette.</p>\n<p>They’re available in the typical 165, 170 and 175mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/what-is-the-best-crank-length-for-cycling/\">crank lengths</a>.</p>\n<p>It also shares the two independently removable bash guards, though this time, they are composite, rather than aluminium as on X0.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723027\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723027\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The crankset features two composite bash guards.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>They’re designed to protect the T-Type Flattop Chain-compatible chainring, which shares the 8-bolt mounting of the higher-end Transmission groupsets.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous generation of GX Eagle AXS, there is no carbon crank option. Given X0 Transmission also doesn’t feature carbon cranks, it’s unlikely we’ll see them in future either.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">eMTB</a> version of the GX Transmission crankset uses the ISIS Interface and is available in shorter 160, 165 and 170mm lengths for improved ground clearance.</p>\n<p>The regular crankset with 30, 32 or 34T chainring and bash guards costs £215/$200/€240, while the eMTB crankset goes for £150/$140/€170.</p>\n<h2>GX Eagle Transmission cassette</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723017\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723017\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The GX Eagle Transmission groupset uses a simpler cassette construction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM says the key part of GX Eagle Transmission’s shifting performance is the T-Type cassette and Flattop chain.</p>\n<p>The XG-1275 T-Type cassette uses a full X-Sync design with narrow-wide teeth and shift lanes that block or enable the chain to move from one gear to the next.</p>\n<p>The cassette also has shift ramps that ensure the chain is in constant contact with the cassette as it shifts, according to SRAM.</p>\n<p>The 10-52t cassette offers a 520 per cent gear range. This is the same as the more expensive Transmission groupsets.</p>\n<p>Previous generation AXS Eagle groupsets featured a 10t jump between the two largest cogs (42t to 52t), which could lead to a lurchy change in cadence when shifting between them.</p>\n<p>The new cassette smooths out this transition with 38t, 44t and 52t cogs at the low end of the cassette.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723018\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723018\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The cassette uses a pinned construction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It also features the red setup cog, which is used to simplify <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-install-and-set-up-sram-t-type-eagle/\">the setup process for Transmission groupsets</a>.</p>\n<p>The construction of the cassette is different from the more expensive options.</p>\n<p>In order to cut costs, GX forgoes the X-Dome single-piece machined construction for the lower gears and instead uses SRAM’s simpler PinDome design. This sees the eight largest cogs pinned together with a single-piece construction used for the four smallest cogs.</p>\n<p>Finally, the cassette is nickel-plated, which the brand claims should make it more durable and quieter.</p>\n<p>While cheaper than other T-Type cassettes, the XG-1275 is still a punchy £270/$250/€300</p>\n<h2>SRAM GX Eagle Transmission Flattop chain</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723012\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723012\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Transmission groupsets require a different chain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The chain uses SRAM’s Flattop profile and solid pins. It is also coated with an unspecified material, which is claimed to improve durability.</p>\n<p>At £55/$50/€60, the chain is substantially cheaper than X0 (£105/$100/€120).</p>\n<h2>SRAM T-Type Eagle Transmission AXS Pod controller/shifter</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723021\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723021\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There is no dedicated GX Eagle Transmission controller.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Unlike the older GX AXS drivetrain, GX Eagle Transmission doesn’t have a standalone controller. Instead, it shares the more basic, non-modular button version of the pod controller with the other Transmissions in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As such, it has the same flippable two-button layout rather than the rocker paddle of old.</p>\n<p>It also shares the Bridge Clamp with 16mm of sliding adjustability. This mounts directly to brakes that are compatible with SRAM’s older MMX clamps.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a single Torx 25 bolt Infinity Clamp handlebar clamping option allows you to mount the controller separately from the brake lever, offering even more adjustability at the cost of a slightly more clutterer handlebar.</p>\n<p>The Standard Pod controller costs £165/$150/€180</p>\n<h2>SRAM GX Eagle Transmission range overview</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723002\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723002\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A full GX Eagle Transmission groupset will set you back £1,180/$1,099/€1,300.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While SRAM’s latest launch product is a lot cheaper than its more expensive siblings, at £1,180/$1,099/€1,300 for a complete GX Eagle Transmission, it is still a pretty significant outlay.</p>\n<p>Included in the price are a GX Eagle Transmission derailleur and accompanying AXS battery, the pod controller, the new XG-1275 10-52T Transmission cassette, the SolidPin Flattop chain and a DUB crankset sporting a 32T chainring with neat two-piece composite bash guards.</p>\n<p>There’s also the option of an ebike groupset for £1,015/$949/€1,250, which is exactly the same but comes without a crankset. However, if you want to go full collar and cuffs, you can buy an e-bike-compatible GX Transmission crankset that uses the ISIS bottom bracket interface.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>New SRAM Bronze Stealth Code and Level brakes</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"AL_MBUK_5723022\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723022\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM has also launched a new affordable brake to complement GX Transmission Eagle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Finally, there are also new Bronze Stealth Code and Level brakes to tie in with the launch of GX Eagle Transmission.</p>\n<p>These join the Ultimate and Silver brakes in SRAM’s range and feature the sleeker-looking <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-stealth-brakes/\">Stealth design</a>, which places the master cylinder closer to the bar.</p>\n<p>This should give you a cleaner cockpit to match up with your fancy Eagle Transmission.</p>\n<p>The Code Bronze Stealth brakes share the same calliper, tool-free reach adjust and SwingLink technology as the more expensive brakes, but forgoes the Contact Point Adjustment and Lever Pivot Bearing of the next model in the line, the Code Silver Stealth.</p>\n<p>The Level Bronze Stealth is available in two- and four-piston variants, and again shares many features with the Level Silver brake, such as the tool-free reach adjust and DirectLink lever design, but like the Code Bronze, does away with the Lever Pivot Bearings.</p>","author":"Tom Law","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0bf05927eacb058f3be5008efba2b8a8ea69d1ed806418838131395b71ad18d7","category":"Cycling"}
