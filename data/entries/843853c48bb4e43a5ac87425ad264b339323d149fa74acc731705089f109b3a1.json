The platform originally existed to sync health data from third-party fitness devices to your Google account, but now it's <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/evolving-health-on-android-migrating-from-google-fit-apis-to-android-health.html\">being killed off</a>. Deprecation of the APIs happened on May 1, and Google has stopped accepting new sign-ups for the API. The official shutdown date is June 30, 2025.</p>\n<p>The Google Fit API was launched <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/google-previews-google-fit-apis-for-sharing-fitness-logging-info/\">in 2014</a>, just a few weeks after Apple announced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/apple-announces-ios-8-at-wwdc/\">Healthkit</a> in iOS 8. The goal of both platforms is to be a central repository for health data from various apps and services. Instead of seeing steps in one app and weight in another, it could all be mushed together into a one-stop-shop for health metrics. Google had a lot of big-name partners at launch, like Nike+, Adidas, Withings, Asus, HTC, Intel, LG, and app makers like Runtastic and RunKeeper.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to 2024, and we get the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/\">familiar story</a> of Google being unable to throw its weight behind a single solution. Today, Google has <em>three</em> competing fitness APIs. There is a \"<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/comparison-guide\">Comparison Guide</a>\" on the Android Developer site detailing the differences between the \"Health Connect\" API, the \"Fitbit Web API\" and the \"Google Fit REST API.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022139#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022139&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"843853c48bb4e43a5ac87425ad264b339323d149fa74acc731705089f109b3a1","category":"Tech"}
