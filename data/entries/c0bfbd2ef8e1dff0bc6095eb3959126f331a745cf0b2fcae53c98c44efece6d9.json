The RCs that we got today represent the final version of the software that's expected at release.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple sometimes releases second RC versions to address bugs, but new features are not typically added at this stage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFirst announced at WWDC, Universal Control is an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and Mac feature that's designed to allow a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard to be used across multiple Mac and ‌iPad‌ devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's ‌macOS Monterey‌ page continues to list the Universal Control feature as \"available later this fall,\" but \"fall\" in the United States ends on December 21, which is when it swaps over to winter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith ‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1 and iPadOS 15.2 expected to launch next week ahead of the Christmas holiday, it is looking increasingly unlikely that we're going to see Universal Control before the end of 2021.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/07/macos-monterey-12-1-no-universal-control/\">Universal Control Not Coming in macOS Monterey 12.1 and iPadOS 15.2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/universal-control-not-coming-in-macos-monterey-12-1-and-ipados-15-2.2326583/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VSfH7AFkYuI:KbYuz_ctU4E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VSfH7AFkYuI:KbYuz_ctU4E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c0bfbd2ef8e1dff0bc6095eb3959126f331a745cf0b2fcae53c98c44efece6d9","category":"Apple"}
