A few Android devices are also eligible, and all must be in good working condition.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fapple-iphone-13-pro-max-128gb-silver.html\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>UP TO $1000 OFF</div>iPhone 13 Pro at AT&amp;T</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you trade in an ‌iPhone‌ X, XR, or XS you'll get $700 credit to put towards the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and an ‌iPhone‌ 7, 7 Plus, SE, 8, or 8 Plus will get you $350 credit. Credits start within three billing cycles after trade in is completed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShoppers should note that this offer is not an early upgrade program, and the trade in device can not be on an existing installment plan on AT&amp;T. For existing customers looking to upgrade their ‌iPhone‌, you can get up to $500 off the ‌iPhone 13‌ or ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>T-Mobile/Sprint</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile has introduced a new \"Forever Upgrade\" offer this year, allowing users to <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/\">get ongoing discounts on new iPhones every two years</a>. Specifically, if you trade in an eligible smartphone you'll get up to $1,000 off ‌iPhone 13‌ or 13 Pro on the Magenta MAX or Sprint MAX plans.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThen, in two years you can get up to $800 off the newest ‌iPhone‌ and every two years after that. T-Mobile says that customers will be able to access this $800 credit every two years \"forever.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>UP TO $1000 OFF</div>iPhone 13 at T-Mobile</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, if you're on another T-Mobile plan, you can get up to half off the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ via 30 monthly bill credits, or up to $500 off the ‌iPhone 13‌. Both of these deals require an eligible trade in.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also buy one ‌iPhone 13‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> and get a second one free (up to $800 credit) with 30 monthly bill credits. This requires you to add a qualifying line on any T-Mobile plan.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Verizon</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAt Verizon, current and new customers can <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-13-pro%2F\">get up to $800 off the iPhone 13 lineup</a> with select trade in offers and on select unlimited plans.
