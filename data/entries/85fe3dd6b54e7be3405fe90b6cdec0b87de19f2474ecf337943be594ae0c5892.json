{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win Custom Painted AirPods 3 From ColorWare","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/12/macrumors-giveaway-colorware-airpods-3/","date":1636743600000,"content":"For this week's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/giveaway/\">giveaway</a>, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com\">ColorWare</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-1248-airpods-3rd-gen.aspx\">custom painted AirPods 3</a>, which are available in dozens of unique color combinations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/colorware-airpods-3-banner.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nColorWare is a customization company that's been offering custom-painted accessories for several years now, one-of-a-kind painting options for everything from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a> to the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/colorware-airpods-3-matte-black.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCustom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a> can be purchased from ColorWare starting at $319 for just the AirPods, but adding in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> Charging Case brings the price up to $369. There's a premium for ordering from ColorWare, but it is the only way to get ‌AirPods 3‌ in a color other than boring white.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/colorware-airpods-options.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nColorWare offers standard and metallic color options, which are also available with gloss or matte finishes. You can choose from several shades of black or go with a metallic silver or gold to match Apple's devices, but there are all kinds of other colors to choose from too. If you want your ‌AirPods 3‌ in teal, purple, orange, yellow, red, pink, blue, green, or one of a dozen other colors, ColorWare can do it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/colorware-airpods-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nEach AirPod can be custom painted in the same color as the case or you can order separate colors for each of the AirPods and another color for the case, resulting in endless color combinations to pick from.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nColorWare has been providing customers with custom painted devices since 1998 and it has perfected its painting process. There's a multi-step coating system that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and a liquid plastic coating that protects the color.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/colorware-airpods-3-metallic.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause ColorWare is using standard ‌AirPods 3‌ from Apple and custom painting them, the full AirPods functionality remains intact. ‌AirPods 3‌ include all of the standard AirPods functionality like quick pairing and easy setup, but also gain Adaptive EQ, spatial audio, IPX4 water resistance, longer battery life, and a ‌MagSafe‌ charging case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe have two sets of custom-painted ‌AirPods 3‌ to give away, and each winner can choose their colors for the earbuds and the charging case.
