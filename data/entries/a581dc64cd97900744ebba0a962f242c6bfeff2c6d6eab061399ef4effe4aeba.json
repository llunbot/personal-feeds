The regulation will enter into force on July 1st 2022.</blockquote>Prior to 2017, when roaming charges were abolished in the EU, holidaymakers and business travelers across Europe would often be stung by excessive phone bills when they got home, with network operators charging exorbitant fees for calls, text, and data used abroad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYears of campaigning saw the practice scrapped in the EU, meaning mobile customers generally no longer have to worry about roaming charges when using their phone in the EU, with most phone tariffs counting calls, texts, and data used in EU countries as equivalent to domestic use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCommenting on the latest agreement to extend the practice, commissioner for the internal market Thierry Breton said: \"Spending holidays in Greece, Austria or Bulgaria, visiting customers or suppliers in Italy or Estoniaâ€¦ traveling abroad without having to worry about phone bills is a tangible part of the EU Single Market experience for all Europeans.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven that the United Kingdom has formally exited the European Union, UK residents won't be able to enjoy the benefits of free roaming when they use their phones abroad. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIndeed, when the EU trade deal was signed in December 2020, mobile operators were once again able to charge customers when traveling in Europe with \"transparent and reasonable rates.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally, EE, O2, Three, and Vodafone, representing the largest mobile operators in the UK, stated they had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges after Brexit, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/three-brings-back-eu-roaming-charges/\">all</a> have since announced changes, some under a \"fair use\" clause.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/10/free-mobile-phone-roaming-eu-until-2032/\">EU Member States Agree to Extend Free Mobile Roaming Policy Until 2032</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-member-states-agree-to-extend-free-mobile-roaming-policy-until-2032.2326940/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QlAjClGP_B4:sc5cXgi1XMQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QlAjClGP_B4:sc5cXgi1XMQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a581dc64cd97900744ebba0a962f242c6bfeff2c6d6eab061399ef4effe4aeba","category":"Apple"}
