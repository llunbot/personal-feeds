Copilot, which uses OpenAI technology, was created to help programmers write, troubleshoot, and translate code into different programming languages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter \"playing around\" with GitHub Copilot in December of 2022, Federighi explained that he had \"come to appreciate\" generative AI, and he reportedly tasked engineering employees with creating new ways to integrate AI features into Apple's apps and features. Prior rumors have suggested that Apple is aiming to integrate AI into as many apps as possible with ‌iOS 18‌ and future software updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple accelerated development on internal generative AI development, even recruiting some former Apple Car employees to work on the technology, but it has also held discussions with OpenAI and Google and is expected to rely on both its internal AI models and external partnerships.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors about features coming in ‌iOS 18‌ indicate that Federighi has been successful in incorporating AI into the operating system in a number of ways, with Apple planning to add AI features to Messages, Mail, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and other key apps. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> will also be overhauled with generative AI, making the personal assistant smarter and more capable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA rundown of all of the new features rumored for ‌iOS 18‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">can be found in our roundup</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-federighi-microsoft-coding-tool/\">Apple's Push Into AI Allegedly Happened After Craig Federighi Tried Microsoft AI Coding Tool</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-push-into-ai-allegedly-happened-after-craig-federighi-tried-microsoft-ai-coding-tool.2428341/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3270ff75d88ae68a8672b76a4e58b9eff17861a9368fada966a700f5547d81f6","category":"Apple"}
