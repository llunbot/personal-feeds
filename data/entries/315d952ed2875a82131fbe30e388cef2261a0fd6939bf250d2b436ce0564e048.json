According to Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212868\">security support document</a>, the update addresses a number of vulnerabilities with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sidecar/\">Sidecar</a>, WebKit, Voice Control, the Status Bar, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMost of these vulnerabilities do not appear to have been used in the wild, and Apple says that just an IOMobileFrameBuffer may have been actively exploited. This issue could allow an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple made upgrading to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> optional, and has allowed people to remain on iOS 14 if they so desire. Apple is continuing to release iOS 14 updates as a result, but these updates will be focused on security fixes and will not be introducing new features. New features will be limited to updates to ‌iOS 15‌, the newest version of iOS.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/26/apple-releases-ios-14-8-1/\">Apple Releases iOS 14.8.1 and iPadOS 14.8.1 With Security Updates</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-14-8-1-and-ipados-14-8-1-with-security-updates.2319614/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0mtDutWNjo8:rGHzn3ABtzk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0mtDutWNjo8:rGHzn3ABtzk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0mtDutWNjo8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"315d952ed2875a82131fbe30e388cef2261a0fd6939bf250d2b436ce0564e048","category":"Apple"}
