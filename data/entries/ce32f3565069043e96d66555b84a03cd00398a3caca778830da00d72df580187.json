However, Apple’s two interrelated settings for how folders open a Finder window don’t seem to have any effect and haven’t for years. Despite this, you can take control to get the desired outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may want one or more of the following behaviors to happen when you double-click a folder within a Finder window, which may vary depending on what you’re trying to accomplish:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Its contents replace what you see in the Finder window.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new tab opens in the window with the double-clicked folder’s contents.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new window in the Finder opens, showing the contents of the double-clicked folder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How it’s supposed to open folders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you search Apple’s support documents, you find that <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-how-folders-open-in-the-finder-on-mac-mchlp1032/mac\">the company says you control this in two ways</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Via  &gt; <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Desktop &amp; Dock</em> by choosing a value from the “Prefer tabs when opening documents” menu: Always, Never, or In Full Screen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Via the Finder setting in <em>Finder &gt; Settings</em> in the General tab labeled “Open folders in tabs instead of new windows.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-desktop-finder-preferences-bordered_92a3ca.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-desktop-finder-preferences-bordered_92a3ca.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1436w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-desktop-finder-preferences-bordered_92a3ca.png?resize=300%2C240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-desktop-finder-preferences-bordered_92a3ca.png?resize=768%2C614&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-desktop-finder-preferences-bordered_92a3ca.png?resize=1200%2C959&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"959\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The Desktop &amp; Dock setting for Windows  should let you control window behavior, but appears to have no actual effect.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-finder-pref-windows-tabs-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-finder-pref-windows-tabs-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 756w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-finder-pref-windows-tabs-bordered.png?resize=281%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 281w\" width=\"756\" height=\"806\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Finder settings let you control how tabs open from folders.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The outcomes <em>should</em> be like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>With the General setting “Prefer tabs…” set to <em>Never</em>, double-clicking should open folders in a new window; <em>Always</em>, in a new tab; <em>In Full Screen</em>, in a tab when you have a window set to full-screen mode.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>With the Finder setting “Open folders in tabs…” checked, double-clicking should open folders in tabs, as it says; otherwise, in new windows.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Forum posters and readers alike find this is not the case and has never been. In testing, I cannot get the promised behavior to work at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are workarounds. Apple even hints at one on its support page, but its description of how it works is incorrect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How you open folders the way you want</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how you have Desktop &amp; Dock and Finder settings configured, here’s how you can achieve what you want in a Finder window. It hinges on whether the Finder toolbar and sidebar are visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can change whether they appear by using <em>View &gt; Hide Sidebar</em> (Command-Option-S) or <em>View &gt; Hide Toolbar</em> (Command-Option-T). The sidebar cannot be shown if the toolbar is hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the toolbar and sidebar visible, here’s how folders behave:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replace the window’s contents:</strong> Double-click a folder within the window.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open the folder in a new window:</strong> Hold Command and double-click a folder (Finder settings “Open folders…” unchecked).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open the folder in a new tab:</strong> Hold Command and double-click a folder (Finder settings “Open folders…” checked).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open a folder in a new window and close the previous one:</strong> Hold Option and double-click a folder. The current window disappears, and a new one opens with the contents of the double-clicked folder. (The new folder has no active Back button in the toolbar.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This changes when you hide both the toolbar and the sidebar. Here’s what your actions result in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open the folder in a new window:</strong> Double-click a folder within the window (Finder settings “Open folders…” unchecked).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open the folder in a new tab:</strong> Double-click a folder within the window (Finder settings “Open folders…” checked).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open a folder in a new window and close the previous one:</strong> Hold Option and double-click a folder. The current window disappears, and a new one opens with the contents of the double-clicked folder. (The new folder has no active Back button in the toolbar.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Prefer tabs” setting doesn’t seem to have any effect in the Finder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve also found that the Finder sometimes loses track of these settings. When testing the toolbar shown/hidden options above, I discovered that the expected behavior stopped worked. I had to hold down Option, click the Finder in the Dock, and choose Relaunch. Only after forcing the Finder to relaunch did the folder behavior resume functioning as I explain just above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Jeff.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
