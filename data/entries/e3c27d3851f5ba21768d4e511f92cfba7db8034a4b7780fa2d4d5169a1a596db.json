His customers are starting to get fed up with the problem, too, and so Wilmer has had the company hard at work on a solution: an uncuttable cable, which should be ready to deploy by early summer.</p>\n<p>\"I literally got so frustrated ... I was at home in my own workshop, building prototypes and taking all my nastiest tools to them, to try and cut them, to see what we could come up with,\" Wilmer told me. It's a simple idea, involving hardened steel and \"some other polymer materials that are just really hard to cut through,\" Wilmer said.</p>\n<p>As well as making cables for its own chargers, ChargePoint plans to license its invention to others in the industry. \"So we've collaborated with a few [cable vendors] to build these cables... and we can refer anyone that's interested to those vendors and give [them] permission to build cables with this technology for someone other than us,\" Wilmer said.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/chargepoint-develops-uncuttable-charging-cables-to-stop-thieves/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/chargepoint-develops-uncuttable-charging-cables-to-stop-thieves/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
