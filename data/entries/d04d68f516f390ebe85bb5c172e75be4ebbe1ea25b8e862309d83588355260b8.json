Compatible devices can now download the iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17 updates without signing up for one of Apple's beta programs.</p>\n<p>The iOS 17 update this year is fairly mild; it includes a smart-display-esque feature called StandBy that can keep your screen on when your phone is plugged in and placed on a stand, plus \"contact posters\" that display full-screen photos when someone in your contacts list is calling, improved autocorrect, and live voicemail transcription.</p>\n<p>Many of iOS 17's announced features, including a new journaling app, several Messages improvements, and Internet-enabled AirDrop transfers, will come in later iOS 17 releases. This is a typical practice for Apple, though the list of \"later this year\" features (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/ios-17-features-coming-later-this-year/\">via MacRumors</a>) seems longer than usual.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968990#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968990&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d04d68f516f390ebe85bb5c172e75be4ebbe1ea25b8e862309d83588355260b8","category":"Tech"}
