The Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo keeps a three-inch display, a touchscreen and five side buttons.</p>\n<p>The first Sigma <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> to be made in Germany, according to the brand, is available now for £379.95/$379.95/€379.95 in white and grey. In a bundle with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-choose-a-heart-rate-monitor/\">heart rate monitor </a>and speed sensor, the Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo costs £479.95/$479.95/€479.95.</p>\n<h2>A choice of routes</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo turn-by-turn navigation\" title=\"rox-12-1-evo-product-image-1500x1500-INT-4\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Sigma claims navigation is excellent away from the road too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sigma</i></span></div>\n<p>The Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo gives turn-by-turn directions with visual and audible prompts, instead of showing a more basic breadcrumb trail and direction arrows like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/sigma-rox-11-1-evo-review/\">ROX 11.1 Evo</a>. Sigma says this device remains available for riders who prefer a smaller, simpler bike computer.</p>\n<p>The Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo uses the OpenStreetMap database and multi-band GPS. This should help the ROX 12.1 Evo find a GPS signal faster than single-band GPS-equipped devices.</p>\n<p>The German-made bike computer reroutes on the fly if you take a turn for the worst while navigating.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Choice of routes on Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo bike computer\" title=\"rox-12-1-evo-product-image-1500x1500-INT-2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Choose between the suggested, shortest and easiest routes to your destination.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sigma </i></span></div>\n<p>You can send GPX files from route-planning apps, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/guide-to-using-komoot/\">Komoot</a>, or from the Sigma Ride app to the head unit.</p>\n<p>You can also search for destinations on the Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo itself. The computer will then offer a choice of three routes, up from two on the ROX 12.0 Sport.</p>\n<p>Sigma says the suggested route is the way best suited to the type of bike you’re riding; the easiest route involves the least elevation and the shortest the least distance.</p>\n<p>The Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo displays the gradient profile of the road ahead. But it does not automatically detect climbs like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-summit-freeride/\">Wahoo’s Summit Freeride</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/garmin-edge-840-solar/\">Garmin’s ClimbPro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/cycle-computers/hammerhead-karoo-2-bike-computer-review/\">Hammerhead’s Climber</a> features.</p>\n<h2>Highly customisable</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Data screen on Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo on red road bike\" title=\"SigmaSport_ROX12-1_Juli22_hires_Vesenbeckh-3923\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The six data screens are customisable and colour-coded.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sigma</i></span></div>\n<p>The Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo comes with six pre-defined activity profiles, including for use on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainers</a>.</p>\n<p>You can configure a further 20 profiles and the ROX 12.1 Evo’s six colour-coded data screens to meet your needs, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>These can be adjusted in either the Sigma Ride app or on the device.</p>\n<p>Sigma says key workouts are pre-installed on the ROX 12.1 Evo. If you’re following a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-training-plan/\">training plan</a>, you can load workouts from third-party <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-apps/\">cycling apps</a>, such as TrainingPeaks.</p>\n<h2>Greater connectivity</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Black Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo on out front handlebar mount\" title=\"SigmaSport_ROX12-1_Juli22_hires_Vesenbeckh-8223\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can now sync the computer to your phone out on the trail.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sigma</i></span></div>\n<p>The Sigma ROX 12.0 Sport only had ANT+ connectivity, but the ROX 12.1 Evo is Bluetooth-enabled as well. As a result, you can sync the computer with your phone, for example to upload a route or activity, without a Wifi connection.</p>\n<p>Sigma says the ROX 12.1 Evo connects to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike </a>systems, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupset</a> shifting.</p>\n<p>Claimed battery life is 14 hours while using sensors and navigating.</p>\n<p>Like the ROX 12.0, the new model connects to ride-sharing apps such as Strava.</p>\n<p>The Sigma ROX 12.1 Evo is integrated with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-adds-strava-live-segments-to-elemnt/\">Strava Live Segments</a>, enabling you to race against yourself or the fastest person on a stretch of road or trail.</p>\n<h2>Smart notifications and Crash Detection</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Three riders on gravel path in countryside\" title=\"SigmaSport_ROX12-1_Juli22_hires_Vesenbeckh-8152\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Emergency contacts can be alerted if you take a tumble and can’t call them yourself.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sigma</i></span></div>\n<p>The ROX 12.1 Evo can display incoming calls, text messages and emails from your paired smartphone.</p>\n<p>The new crash detection system prompts you to confirm your safety within 30 seconds of detecting an impact.</p>\n<p>Without confirmation, the device sends an emergency alert including your GPS coordinates to pre-selected contacts in the Sigma Ride app.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9c72728406368668fade30616901fc7eb551ee268b654388fea6819e33603c72","category":"Cycling"}
