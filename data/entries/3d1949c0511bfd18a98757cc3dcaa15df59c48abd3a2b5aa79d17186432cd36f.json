The SSD has ‌MagSafe‌ compatibility, and it attaches to the back of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> magnetically.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/sandisk-magsafe-ssd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nAn included USB-C cable then connects the SSD to the ‌iPhone‌, allowing the setup to be used while on-the-go. SanDisk's SSD is compatible with Apple ProRes recording.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models can be connected to an external storage device over USB-C, and recorded ProRes files can be stored directly on the SSD. Requirements include write speeds of at least 220MB/s for 4K60 ProRes, and 440MB/s for 4K120 ProRes and a USB-C cable that supports 10Gb/s transfer speeds at a minimum.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSanDisk's Creator Phone SSD supports read speeds of up to 1000MB/s, and write speeds of up to 950MB/s, so it is fast enough to be used for ProRes recording.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe SSD has a durable silicone shell, three-meter drop protection, and IP65 water and dust resistance, which means it is able to handle some moisture exposure. SanDisk is offering it in 1TB and 2TB capacities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 1TB model is <a href=\"https://shop.sandisk.com/products/ssd/portable-ssd/sandisk-creator-portable-phone-ssd?sku=SDSSDE62C-1T00-G25\">priced starting at $110</a>, and it will be available for purchase this spring. The 2TB model will be priced at $170.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">CES 2025</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/sandisk-magsafe-ssd/\">SanDisk Debuts MagSafe-Compatible SSD for iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sandisk-debuts-magsafe-compatible-ssd-for-iphones.2447015/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3d1949c0511bfd18a98757cc3dcaa15df59c48abd3a2b5aa79d17186432cd36f","category":"Apple"}
