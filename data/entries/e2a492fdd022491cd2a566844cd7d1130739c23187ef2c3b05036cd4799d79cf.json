{"title":"Google Chrome, Along With Other Popular Chromium Browsers, Grants System Monitoring Privileges to *.google.com Domains","link":"https://x.com/lcasdev/status/1810696257137959018","date":1720824813000,"content":"\n<p>Luca Casonato:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, Google Chrome gives all *.google.com sites full access to\nsystem / tab CPU usage, GPU usage, and memory usage. It also gives\naccess to detailed processor information, and provides a logging\nbackchannel.</p>\n\n<p>This API is not exposed to other sites - only to *.google.com.</p>\n\n<p>This is interesting because it is a clear violation of the idea\nthat browser vendors should not give preference to their websites\nover anyone else’s.</p>\n\n<p>The DMA codifies this idea into law: browser vendors, as\ngatekeepers of the internet, must give the same capabilities to\neveryone. Depending on how you interpret the DMA, this additional\nexposure of information only to Google properties may be\nconsidered a violation of the DMA. Take for example Zoom - they\nare now at a disadvantage because they can not provide the same\nCPU debugging feature as Google Meet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I frequently bemoan the DMA’s ambiguity but here I’d say it’s crystal clear. <a href=\"https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/gatekeepers_en\">Chrome is a designated gatekeeping platform</a>, and granting system-monitoring privileges <em>only to Google’s own websites</em> is clearly in violation. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40918742\">Here’s a Hacker News comment from a purported Google employee</a> who calls the feature “mundane” while admitting that Google Meet uses it as a tool to debug bad connections, even though no other web-based meeting app has access to it. I can think of no better example proving that Google views the open web as a platform that it owns.</p>\n\n<p>But put the DMA aside. This is just creepy. It’s clearly a privacy violation. I don’t want Google to know what kind of CPU I have, how many cores, and how busy they are.  And the makers of other Chromium-based browsers are so lazy that their browsers — Microsoft Edge and Brave at least — include this same “feature”. I don’t mean that Edge grants system-monitoring privileges to Microsoft’s websites. Edge grants these privileges to Google’s websites, and Google’s alone.</p>\n\n<p>But speaking of the DMA, Chromium is, <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share\">far and away</a>, the most popular browser engine that the DMA compels Apple to allow on iOS. There are legitimate reasons to wish that Apple allowed third-party browser engines on iOS. But there are also legitimate reasons why Apple <em>doesn’t</em> allow them. <a href=\"https://chromeisbad.com/\">Chrome really is bad</a>. Better to let the market decide than let clueless regulators decide.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/9/hangout_servicesthunkjs/\">Via Simon Willison</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/12/google-chrome-system-monitoring\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e2a492fdd022491cd2a566844cd7d1130739c23187ef2c3b05036cd4799d79cf","category":"Tech"}
