And as they say, if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. And so it is with the “I SHOULD BE FISH’N” cap ($36).</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>First, he took a Richardson “Umpqua” No. 256 cap blank. Then he removes the rope, cuts out the internal structured flap, and throws them as far as the eye can see. Maybe even further.. And behold! He gets exactly what he’s been looking for: An Unstructured, Mid-Pro Profile Crown, a Classic low-profile flat-brim cap. Adjustable snapback that will fit *most noggins.</p>\n<p>Throw in SPF 50 and a lightweight construction and sure enough, you’ve got yourself one heck of a cap. Even better? Kris personally sews on the “I SHOULD BE FISH’N” patch himself. Sometimes it takes him two tries to get the damned thing straight but thus is the plight of perfectly imperfect.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/06/44-Bikes-Fish-N-Cap-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The patch is sourced from Kris’ pal Sean at the legendary Brewery Outfitters located in the other city called Portland out there on the left coast in Oregon. What you get is a cap that won’t let you down. What’s better is if the days not going your way, just one peek in the mirror will remind you where you should be… I SHOULD BE FISH’N.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Richardson “Umpqua” No. 256 Cap Blank</li>\n<li>Modified, and sewn right here at 44HQ</li>\n<li>Mid-Crown, Classic Low Profile Trucker, Flat Brim, PURE BUSINESS</li>\n<li>SPF 50 for Bald Spots</li>\n<li>Adjustable snap back fits *most noggins</li>\n<li>Matte “lodin” green aka olive drab</li>\n<li>Blue, white and tonal green FISH’N patch</li>\n<li>Patch supplied by Brewery Outfitters, Portland OR.</li>\n<li>$36.00 + shipping and 44 Bikes will ship globally</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/product/i-should-be-fishn-cap/\" target=\"_blank\">cap</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/product/i-should-be-fishn-patch/\" target=\"_blank\">patch</a> at <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/shop/\" target=\"_blank\">44 Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/44-bikes-i-should-be-fishn-cap/\">44 Bikes I Should Be Fish’n’ Cap</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e318dd20f982af0f0744604d12790bf6ab72e469f4b9a8215e710a483316dc51","category":"Cycling"}
