But after you set your new screen saver and customize your widgets, you might find one new feature you don’t actually want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s called Click Wallpaper to Reveal Desktop and if you’ve used it, it’s probably been accidentally. Maybe you’ve misclicked on a file or shortcut or inadvertently clicked on your desktop wallpaper. However you got there, you were probably very confused when your windows flew away to reveal your desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has given us the ability to quickly show your desktop for a while, either through a four-finger spread gesture or Hot Corner, but in macOS Sonoma, your desktop will show just by clicking somewhere on your wallpaper. The first time I activated it, I thought I had done something wrong. The second time I thought I had inadvertently activated the gesture. By the third time, I just assumed I was going crazy.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Sonoma desktop &amp; Dock settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macos-sonoma-desktop-dock-settings.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out it’s a Stage Manager feature that Apple has turned on by default. If you go to the <em>Desktop &amp; Dock</em> tab in System Settings, there’s a new <em>Click Wallpaper to Reveal Desktop</em> option in the Desktop &amp; Stage Manager section with two options: <em>Always</em> and <em>Only in Stage Manager</em>. If you’re like me and never use Stage Manager, setting it to <em>Only in Stage Manager</em> means you’ll never see it again. I don’t know why Apple added it as a default, but thankfully they’ve given us an easy way to disable it.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7f5ac4b2fb4045338d327eadfbc0a07202f020eb03727a4eabe543319144f173","category":"Apple"}
