Preview has been a staple on the Mac since Mac OS X launched but has never appeared on another platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman reports that Preview on iPhone and iPad will look and operate “similar to the Mac version.” It will have a launch screen similar to that used with the iWork apps on iOS, with large app branding at the top half of the screen, and a document picker below it. Preview is mainly used as PDF viewer and editor, but it can also and edits image files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new preview app will be preinstalled as part of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 later this year. It will not be a separate App Store download as with the iWork apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Preview app is among several app updates that Apple plans to unveil at WWDC Monday.
