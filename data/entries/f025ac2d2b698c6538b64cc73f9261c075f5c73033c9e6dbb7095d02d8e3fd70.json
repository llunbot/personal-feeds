The HDMI Forum announced at CES today that it's time to start considering new headaches. <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hdmi-forum-announces-version-2-2-of-the-hdmi-specification-302336592.html\">HDMI 2.2</a> will require new cables for full compatibility, but it has the same physical connectors. Tiny QR codes are suggested to help with that, however.</p>\n<p>The new specification is named HDMI 2.2, but compatible cables will carry an \"Ultra96\" marker to indicate that they can carry 96GBps, double the 48 of HDMI 2.1b. The Forum anticipates this will result in higher resolutions and refresh rates and a \"next-gen HDMI <a href=\"https://www.murideo.com/uploads/5/2/9/0/52903137/frl_data_chart_murideo.pdf\">Fixed Rate Link</a>.\" The Forum cited \"AR/VR/MR, spatial reality, and light field displays\" as benefiting from increased bandwidth, along with medical imaging and machine vision.</p>\n<figure>\n      <img width=\"1024\" height=\"2003\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-1024x2003.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-1024x2003.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-640x1252.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-768x1502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-785x1536.jpg 785w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-1047x2048.jpg 1047w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-980x1917.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-1440x2817.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Latency-Indication-Protocol-LIP-scaled.jpg 1309w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Examples of how HDMI 2.2's synchronization abilities will benefit home theaters.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n      <figure>\n      <img width=\"1024\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison-1024x700.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison-1024x700.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison-640x438.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison-768x525.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison-1536x1050.png 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison-980x670.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison-1440x985.png 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Bandwidth-Comparison.png 1654w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      A visualization of how far HDMI has come in bandwidth, from 1.0 to 2.2.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  \n<p>A bit closer to home, the HDMI 2.2 specification also includes \"Latency Indication Protocol\" (LIP), which can help improve audio and video synchronization.

Illustrations offered by the Forum show LIP working to correct delays on headphones, soundbars connected through ARC or eARC, and mixed systems where some components may be connected to a TV, while others go straight into the receiver.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/hdmi-2-2-will-require-new-ultra96-cables-whenever-we-have-8k-tvs-and-content/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/hdmi-2-2-will-require-new-ultra96-cables-whenever-we-have-8k-tvs-and-content/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f025ac2d2b698c6538b64cc73f9261c075f5c73033c9e6dbb7095d02d8e3fd70","category":"Tech"}
