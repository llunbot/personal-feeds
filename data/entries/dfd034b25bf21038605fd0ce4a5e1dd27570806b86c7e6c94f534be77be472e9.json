{"title":"Livestock x Adidas Velosamba Gives Classic Cycling Shoe ‘Triple Rush’ Treatment","link":"https://bikerumor.com/livestock-x-adidas-velosamba/","date":1681984800000,"content":"<p>If you want it yesterday, you put the “Triple Rush” on it. That’s a term for high-priority packages coined by those heroes of urban cycling, New York City bike couriers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Livestock and Adidas splash phrases across the new Velosamba Triple Rush. The versatile, slickly-styled piece of footwear is designed to be equally comfortable for commuters and functional for couriers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-800x1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Triple Rushes hanging off a bike tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-240x300.jpg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-96x120.jpg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-4-scaled.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The stock Velosamba <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/adidas-kicks-it-classic-casual-with-clipless-velosamba-cycling-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\">has been around for a while</a>, and the aim is a shoe that’s stiff enough for “efficient pedaling [but] still flexes for comfortable walking.” In service of that utility, the Velosamba gets a full-length reinforced midsole and two-bolt cleat compatibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-800x1000.jpg\" alt=\"the bottom of the triple rush, showcasing the cleat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-240x300.jpg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-96x120.jpg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-3-scaled.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Livestock collab differs from the classic in materials and styling. The Livestock Velosamba Triple Rush comes with both suede and ballistic nylon. It’s an homage to the motley but durable getup that most couriers wear.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the style department, I’d classify Livestock’s take as understated, rendered as it is in grey and black with the small, splashed yellow font. And of course, the ubiquitous Adidas “three-stripe” design makes its presence felt.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-800x1000.jpg\" alt=\"a tight view of the triple rush, with yellow font visible \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-240x300.jpg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-96x120.jpg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/triple-rush-2-scaled.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s real steez in the insoles, which show off an illustration of a frantic bike courier busting ass to deliver his package safe and sound. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Triple Rush weighs in 442g per shoe (claimed).
