Some cyclists lose themselves in beer and bacchanalian excess. Others <a href=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/off-season-1-of-1-2.jpg\">swim with dolphins</a>. Entire teams disappear to the Formula 1 tracks of the Middle East to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVSPcFksqsX/\">drive fast cars in circles</a>.</p><p>Thibaut Pinot, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/alaphilippe-alone-a-world-champions-second-coming/\">French cycling’s second-greatest heart-throb</a>, does not concern himself with these fleeting thrills. Thibaut Pinot and his partner, Charlotte Patat, have bought a new cow.</p><p>I say ‘a new cow’, but that doesn’t do it justice, really. Firstly, because it’s an inaccurate statement – Pinot and Patat have bought <em>two</em> new cows (one brown, one cream). Secondly, because ‘cow’ doesn’t really conjure the magnificence of what we see here.</p><p>Observe the brown one. It is small, and has big liquid eyes. It is the most gentle, soft-looking creature that nature can conjure. It has a gentle, inquisitive snout, a daring hairstyle, and a certain fire burning in its eyes.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-1.56.26-pm.png\"></figure><p>Now to the cream one. It is like the brown one, but it is cream, and it does not have a ponytail sprouting from its forehead. For this reason it is the lesser of the two cows, but that can be fixed with a scrunchie.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.41.39-pm.png\"></figure><p>Thibaut Pinot’s two cows do not exist in a vacuum. The cows’ internet debut comes via the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kim.goat/?hl=en\">Instagram account of one of Pinot’s goats, Kim</a>. He has at least one more goat – Quentine – as well as at least four (4) donkeys, a sheep, multiple chickens – including a Sussex hen called Chanel – and <em>even more cows</em>.</p><p>Pinot’s wholesome rustic existence has not gone unnoticed by the world. Since at least 2017, he has been the most renowned pet owner in modern cycling. Heck, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/thibaut-pinot-and-his-goats-have-a-casualwear-range/\">his goats even have merch</a>.</p><p>But the Frenchman’s grip on the ‘best pro/pet owner’ throne has increasingly come under attack from younger, hungrier rivals.</p><p>Filippo Ganna’s rise to the top of pro cycling has brought with it his excellent sheepdog, Mia, who made a cameo at the 2021 Giro d’Italia wearing pink ribbons and was frankly the best thing that happened all race.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CORVOS_00033176-113-1340x893.jpg\"></figure><p>Egan Bernal, winner of that same race, has in a few short years gone from a naive 22-year-old Tour de France winner to an old soul. In a post-Giro press conference, he wistfully detailed how he “mainly think[s] about a life at home with my animals: my three dogs, a cow and the chickens. Together with my girlfriend and my family. I really don’t need that much to be happy. Happiness is in the small things, certainly not in the material things.”</p><p>As recently as yesterday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OutOfCycling/status/1453424995779162123\">Bernal was wearing very little material and training a German Shepherd</a>, and he certainly looked happy, so I believe him.</p><blockquote><p>Lo más importante!! <a href=\"https://t.co/nJBOpiOCmr\">pic.twitter.com/nJBOpiOCmr</a></p>— Egan Arley Bernal (@Eganbernal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eganbernal/status/1349779579188244487?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 14, 2021</a></blockquote><p>It doesn’t stop there. Belgian phenomenon <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/the-next-big-thing-in-belgian-cycling-introducing-mauri-vansevenant/\">Mauri Vansevenant has some lambs</a>. Will Clark has <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/from-racing-bikes-to-shearing-sheep-will-clarke-is-a-farmer-now/\">15,000 of them</a>. Wout van Aert has two goats, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Debby_Drckx/status/1415632863026950148\">Albi and Lila</a>. <a href=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Yves-Lampaert-keeps-having-a-beer.jpg\">Yves Lampaert has a Deere</a>.</p><p>By our reckoning, Pinot’s new cows have reestablished his position as pro cycling’s premier pet owner, but if Bernal, Ganna et al have shown us anything, it’s that this is a fickle game. Benoit Cosnefroy could roll in with a llama tomorrow and <em>then</em> where would we be?</p><p>Until then, we hope that Thibaut Pinot and his new cows have a happy, wholesome future. They are, collectively and individually, very good indeed.</p></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e98b790e57c64638c86f1e1deec095297f53261b305ef8d4c9e9a95d3d80d13f","category":"Cycling"}
