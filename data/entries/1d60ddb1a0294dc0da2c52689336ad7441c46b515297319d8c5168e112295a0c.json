The best players in that year’s NFL draft are starting to get their first big contract extensions, so the timeline should be a good indicator of who is actually good. Though of course there should be plenty of time in cycling for a few late bloomers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have a skim, let me know how I did in the comments or on social media. Pre-warning, yes I missed Carlos Rodríguez, I think about that every day, but remember Tom Brady didn’t get picked until the 199th pick.</strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-mens-cycling-2024\">Opinion: Men’s cycling has never been more bleak for fans</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\">Opinion: Tadej Pogačar is the Greatest Of All Time</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mauri-vansevenant-and-the-rise-of-the-heavy-metal-cyclist\">Mauri Vansevenant and the rise of the heavy metal cyclist</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2024: Stage-by-stage preview and how to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Picture it: teams, fans and prospects gather at the Roubaix velodrome. Topless Belgian fans cradling their beers are chanting ‘Remco! Remco! Remco!’ David Lappartient steps up to the podium and begins, ‘With the first pick of the 2021 UCI WorldTour draft, Israel Start-Up Nation select…’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s absolutely bonkers, but that’s American sports and given last night was the first round of the NFL Draft, we thought it would be fun to imagine what it might look like if men’s cycling had a draft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purpose of the exercise, let’s just forget everything that’s plausible or realistic – yes, if this actually happened an actual <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> winner wouldn’t be involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To have some semblance of realism, we used the <a href=\"https://www.uci.org/road/rankings\" target=\"_blank\">UCI’s team rankings</a> from the end of the 2020 season – in reverse order for parity – and a list of the <a href=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/teams/youngest-riders\" target=\"_blank\">100 youngest WorldTour riders</a> and off we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Israel Start-Up Nation – Tadej Pogačar</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03104806/tadej_pogacar_by_dario_belingheri_va_getty-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tadej_pogacar_by_dario_belingheri_va_getty\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri via Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Much to <em>Cyclist </em>digital editor Joe Robinson’s disgust (big Remco guy), Pogačar is the only selection here. He already has a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> and a Monument under his belt and looks almost unbeatable every time he gets on the bike. A sensation with the potential to win any race on the calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Qhubeka-Assos – Remco Evenepoel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"490\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/07125516/remco_evenepoel_by_pool_laurie_dieffembacq_via_getty_images-970x490.jpeg\" alt=\"remco_evenepoel_by_pool_laurie_dieffembacq_via_getty_images\" /><figcaption>Laurie Dieffembacq/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that young Remco hasn’t yet been fully unleashed onto the WorldTour is a travesty, we’re praying that his recovery has gone well enough that he can compete at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does he think he’s the GOAT but Joe is adamant he would be picked first in any draft.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux – Tom Pidcock</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>His potential was no secret before the season began, but the longer it goes on the more Pidcock cements himself as GB cycling’s next hero. A win and a half in the Classics only scratches the surface of what he can do, let’s see how he goes at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a Espana</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’d rock Intermarché’s fluorescent kit too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Cofidis – Marc Hirschi</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hirschi’s stock is plummeting as the days go by, if this had been done in January then he could’ve been higher. An outstanding 2020 season showed Hirschi as an immense talent in the Classics and as a breakaway <em>artiste, </em>his big move to UAE Team Emirates hasn’t exactly gone well so far results-wise but there’s still time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cofidis would be wise to take the punt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Movistar – João Almeida</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_-970x711.jpg\" alt=\"joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_-970x711.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_-300x220.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_-768x563.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_-1536x1126.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_-750x550.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_-1140x835.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044244/joao_almeida_by_gonzalo_arroyo_moreno_via_getty_.jpg 1984w\" /><figcaption>Gonzalo Arroya Morena via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Portuguese youngster thrilled the hearts and minds of cycling fans everywhere with his performance at the Giro last year. Not only did he hold onto the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\" target=\"_blank\">maglia rosa</a> </em>for most of the race, he fought for every sprint and showed out in the time-trials. Massive potential and would suit Movistar well – one more contender can’t hurt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Lotto-Soudal – Brandon McNulty</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next American GC prospect, McNulty has already shown that he can compete at the highest level with a couple of standout performances at last year’s Giro. He almost did the business at the Itzulia Basque Country but blew up on the final stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He might not be as Belgian as Lotto-Soudal but competing in the general classification would keep the sponsors happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. AG2R-Citroën – Mauri Vansevenant</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AG2R are going all in for one-day racing, and Mauri Vansevenant is a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mauri-vansevenant-and-the-rise-of-the-heavy-metal-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">heavy metal cyclist</a>. Enough said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Bahrain Victorious – Ivan Sosa</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This will either push Mikel Landa over the edge or just add another big talent to that mountains train that’s yet to get a big result. Sosa has proven his climbing credentials with a couple of wins in the Tour de la Provence, he just needs to take the next step. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. Team BikeExchange – Robert Stannard</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is he Australian (and rides for BikeExchange in real life) but he’s stood out in the Classics this year. While a podium is yet to come, he’s got legs. Plus he’s called Stannard, he <em>must</em> be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. EF Education-Nippo – Ide Schelling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Stannard, Schelling has had a good start to the year in the one-day races including a fourth at De Brabantse Pijl. EF are the most stylish team, both in kit and the way they race, Ide would fit right in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>11. Groupama-FDJ – Clément Champoussin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s the best French talent on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>12. Trek-Segafredo – Stefan Bissegger</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trek-Segafredo have a dual threat in the Classics, several talented climbers including <em>Lo Squalo. </em>It’s time to win a TT or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>13. Astana-Premier Tech – Vadim Pronskiy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Place of birth: Astana. Say no more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>14. Bora-Hansgrohe – Ethan Hayter</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/03044150/ethan_hayter_by_a.s.o.aurelien_vialatte-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"ethan_hayter_by_a.s.o.aurelien_vialatte\" /><figcaption>ASO/Aurelien Vialatte</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hayter’s versatility and pedigree mean he’s destined for a few big wins. Bora could strengthen both their Classics and stage racing squads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>15. Team DSM – Max Kanter</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sprinters are the running backs of cycling, a necessity for the top teams but not necessarily valued as highly as your GC contenders, therefore they only start to pop up at the end of the first round. Plus he’s called Max Kanter and he’s a sprinter!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>16. Ineos Grenadiers – Jake Stewart</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge British talent, Ineos would need mere seconds to make this call. Stewart announced himself in a big way bagging second at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, and that was only the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>17. UAE Team Emirates – Quinn Simmons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Controversial? Yes. Talented? Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>18. Deceuninck-QuickStep – Mikkel Bjerg</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bjerg’s engine would get Lefevere another win or two. Despite not being Belgain, several U23 World titles in the TT more than show his talent. In real life they would trade all their picks for the next three years to move up and bag Remco though, it’s the only way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>19. Jumbo-Visma – Matteo Jorgenson</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s give the Killer Bees another rider with big GC potential to close out the first round. The high mountains would be like that episode of Black Mirror, Pogačar swarmed by yellow and black. Roglic, Van Aert, Kuss, Bennett, Vingegaard, Gesink, Kruijswijk, Jorgenson. (Please come back Dumoulin, we miss you.)</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-mens-cycling-2024\">Opinion: Men’s cycling has never been more bleak for fans</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\">Opinion: Tadej Pogačar is the Greatest Of All Time</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mauri-vansevenant-and-the-rise-of-the-heavy-metal-cyclist\">Mauri Vansevenant and the rise of the heavy metal cyclist</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2024: Stage-by-stage preview and how to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/if-cycling-did-an-american-style-draft-what-would-happen\">Cyclist Revisited: If cycling did an American-style draft, what would happen?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1d60ddb1a0294dc0da2c52689336ad7441c46b515297319d8c5168e112295a0c","category":"Cycling"}
