Five Democratic Representatives joined the Republican majority to pass a bill that would prohibit the US Environmental Protection Agency from enacting stricter new corporate average fuel efficiency regulations that would require automakers to sell many more EVs by the year 2032.</p>\n<p>Its passage in the House follows <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/car-dealers-say-they-cant-sell-evs-tell-biden-to-slow-their-rollout/\">a letter-writing campaign by some US auto dealers</a> to get the White House to abandon its climate targets as the dealers say they find it too difficult to sell electric vehicles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/automakers-may-have-to-sell-4x-more-evs-under-new-proposed-cafe-rules/\">As Ars detailed at the time</a>, the tougher new regulations will require automakers to sell four times as many zero-emission vehicles to meet the new fleet averages. If the rules go into effect, two-thirds of all new passenger cars and light trucks would have to be EVs by 2032.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989420#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989420&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
