Fitbit.com used to be both a storefront and a way for users to get a big-screen UI to sift through reams of fitness data. The store <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/04/27/fitbit-google-store-replaced/\">closed up shop</a> in April, and now the web dashboard <a href=\"https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/Fitbit-com-web-dashboard-is-transitioning-to-the-Fitbit-app/td-p/5613159\">is dying</a> in July.</p>\n<p>In a post on the \"Fitbit Community\" forums, the company said: \"Next month, we’re consolidating the Fitbit.com dashboard into the Fitbit app. The web browser will no longer offer access to the Fitbit.com dashboard after July 8, 2024.\" That's it. There's no replacement or new fitness thing Google is more interested in; web functionality is just being removed. Google, we'll remind you, used to be a web company. Now it's a phone app or nothing. Google did the same thing to its Google Fit product <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/google-fit-website-to-close-on-march-19-shifting-focus-to-mobile-and-smartwatch/\">in 2019</a>, killing off the more powerful website in favor of an app focus.</p>\n<p>Dumping the web app leaves a few holes in Fitbit's ecosystem. The Fitbit app doesn't support big screens like tablet devices, so this is removing the only large-format interface for data. Fitbit's competitors all have big-screen interfaces. Garmin has a <a href=\"https://connect.garmin.com/\">very similar</a> website, and the Apple Watch has <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-started-with-health-ipadf82bbc87/ipados\">an iPad health app</a>. This isn't an improvement. To make matters worse, the app does not have the features of the web dashboard, with many of the <em>livid</em> comments in the forums <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1ddm7yp/fitbitcom_web_dashboard_shutting_down_in_july/\">on Reddit</a> calling out the app's deficiencies in graphing, achievement statistics, calorie counting, and logs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030992#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030992&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c0f0a5ec85e1bb93a45b16c32099a460450c2541f03771b90803164e5992af6f","category":"Tech"}
