The Camera Control button can be used for a number of different functions when capturing images and video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-capture-button.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple says that the Camera Control button is meant to work in either landscape or portrait mode, and it was built with a force sensor and touch sensor to support different gestures.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Single click - Open up the Camera app (or a third-party app).</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Single click, Camera open - Take a photo.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Click and hold - Open Camera app, start a video recording.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Light press - Open up controls like zoom. This button will also lock focus and exposure (coming this fall) for reframing shots without losing focus.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Double light press - Bring up the camera preview menu to choose different controls like exposure or depth of field.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Swipe - Swap through available adjustment options, and also change parameters like zoom, exposure, or depth of field when a control is selected.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThe button has deep software support, so you can also swap between control functions without having to go into the Camera app manually.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Adjust zoom</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Adjust exposure</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Adjust depth of field</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Swipe through different stylistic options</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThird-party developers will be able to take advantage of the Camera Control for their apps for adjusting settings, and it will work in social media apps like Snapchat.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLater this year, Camera Control will be able to work with a new visual intelligence feature. Users will be able to open the Camera app and point it at an object to get information about that object with a click and hold gesture. Pointing it at a restaurant, for example, will bring up hours and ratings, while pointing it at a plant will identify the plant. Using visual control with something that has a date, such as a flyer, will add the date to the Calendar app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCamera Control will work as a gateway to third-party tools, such as when users want to search Google for an item to buy or use ChatGPT to solve a problem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are settings that will allow users to change the double press speed and the sensitivity of the button for a light press.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Camera Control has a sapphire crystal covering with a smooth texture, surrounded by stainless steel trim. It is inset into the ‌iPhone‌'s frame just a bit, and the force sensor has haptic feedback to make it feel like a DSLR camera shutter.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-camera-control-button/\">Here's What the New iPhone 16 Camera Control Button Can Do</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-what-the-new-iphone-16-camera-control-button-can-do.2435573/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2125fe8165ea6878dbf18185728ae2d1416e8ef18646ae4f4d118e51fe8cd844","category":"Apple"}
