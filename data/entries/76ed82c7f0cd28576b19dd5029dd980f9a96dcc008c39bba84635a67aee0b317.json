Pressing a button on the necklace allows the user to speak to Friend, with a message sent to the ‌iPhone‌ in response. Friend is also able to send messages without a conversational prompt, responding to what the wearer is doing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Friend and its \"memories\" are stored on the necklace, with nothing uploaded to cloud servers. Friend creator Avi Schiffmann <a href=\"https://www.friend.com/blog.html\">said in a blog post</a> that the device is an \"expression of how lonely\" he's felt. In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24207029/friend-ai-companion-gadget\">The Verge</a></em>, Schiffmann said that Friend is designed to be supportive, validating, and able to encourage ideas. \"It's a great brainstorming buddy,\" he said. \"You can talk to it about relationships, things like that.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFriend is <a href=\"https://www.friend.com/\">available for pre-order</a> for $99, and it is set to launch in January 2025.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/friend-necklace-ai-companionship/\">New 'Friend' Necklace Offers AI Companionship</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-friend-necklace-offers-ai-companionship.2432570/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"76ed82c7f0cd28576b19dd5029dd980f9a96dcc008c39bba84635a67aee0b317","category":"Apple"}
