Shifting has picked up lots of improvements, be they electronic or wireless, as have derailleurs and internal gearboxes. Materials and tolerances have only improved over the decades.</p>\n<p>But in almost all cases, you're still manually adjusting something to move the chain and change gears, depending on the resistance you're feeling on the bike. Even <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/ceramicspeed-driven-chainless-drivetrain-shifts-performs-under-load/\">the most outlandish recent ideas</a> still involve indexed movement between different-sized gears.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987481#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987481&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d91e40e71db02d78e8abdc7f6f4578fc9cd54dae1e50f129817b340cf4461119","category":"Tech"}
