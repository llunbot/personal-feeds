But scientists have long debated the extent of her bipedalism. Now a 3D digital re-creation of Lucy's muscular anatomy, combined with computer simulations, has reaffirmed that she was quite capable of walking fully erect. The results appeared in a new paper published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.</p>\n<p>“Lucy’s ability to walk upright can only be known by reconstructing the path and space that a muscle occupies within the body,” <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/992054\">said author Ashleigh Wiseman</a>, an archaeologist at Cambridge University. “We are now the only animal that can stand upright with straight knees. Lucy’s muscles suggest that she was as proficient at bipedalism as we are, while possibly also being at home in the trees.”</p>\n<p>Lucy's remains were found in 1974 in Ethiopia at a site called Hadar. Several paleoarchaeologists—including Donald Johanson, Mary Leakey, and Yves Coppens—began surveying the site for signs of fossils relating to the origin of humans. The first interesting find occurred in November 1971, when Johanson found a fossilized upper shinbone and, nearby, the lower end of a femur. Now known as AL 129-1 and dating back more than 3 million years, the angle of the knee joint indicated this was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini\">hominin</a> (now known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_afarensis\"><em>Australopithecus afarensi</em>s</a>) capable of walking upright.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947108#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947108&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"75ee5385e17ac1a6191aca08a7432f5623915be1b482a3e65e08edb6faa26fab","category":"Tech"}
