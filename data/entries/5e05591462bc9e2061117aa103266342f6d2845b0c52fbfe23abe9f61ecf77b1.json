Now you can barely avoid the symbol widely known as the hashtag and ubiquitous on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you type a hash or hashtag symbol on a Mac? Well, that depends on your keyboard layout. For readers using the standard U.S. layout, it’s pretty simple, if you are in the U.K. it is a little trickier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where is the Hash Key?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an Apple keyboard, with a U.S. keyboard layout, things are simple. To type a hashtag sign, hit <strong>Shift + 3</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Mac US keyboard layout\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-US-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>You’ll notice that the euro sign has also disappeared.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to type a hashtag sign (#) in the U.K.</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UK-extra-keys-on-keyboard.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"UK extra keys on keyboard\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UK-extra-keys-on-keyboard.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 589w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UK-extra-keys-on-keyboard.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UK-extra-keys-on-keyboard.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"589\" height=\"327\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The ‘hidden’ keys on a U.K. Apple keyboard</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Because U.S. readers have less need for the pound sign, the hash sign gets higher billing: it’s the secondary option for the 3 key. But on U.K. keyboards that space is reserved for £, so typing Shift + 3 will give you £.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To type a hashtag on a Mac keyboard with a U.K. layout, press <strong>Option + 3</strong>. (The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670647/what-is-the-option-key-on-a-mac.html\">Option key</a> is sometimes known as Alt, by the way.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Mac UK keyboard layout\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mac-UK-keyboard-layout.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>U.K. keyboards have to relegate the # to the number 3’s Option slot, because we need the Shift slot for our glorious British pound sign.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On some old keyboards you’ll find that the number 3 key only has the pound sign. Don’t be put off: pressing <strong>Option + 3</strong> will still work on such keyboards. It’s just that in those days, the hash sign wasn’t viewed as such an important character. (You may also find that your older Mac keyboard labels the Option key as Alt.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3688542/mac-keyboard_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mac Keyboard UK\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Alt?

And when you hold Shift, it types a vertical line (or |)? In that case, our guess would be that you’re inadvertently using a PC keyboard.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hash-key-on-UK-PC-keyboard-layout-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Hash key on UK PC keyboard layout\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hash-key-on-UK-PC-keyboard-layout-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2248w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hash-key-on-UK-PC-keyboard-layout-1.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hash-key-on-UK-PC-keyboard-layout-1.jpg?resize=768%2C466&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hash-key-on-UK-PC-keyboard-layout-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C728&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hash-key-on-UK-PC-keyboard-layout-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C932&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hash-key-on-UK-PC-keyboard-layout-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1243&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"621\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>A handy key for hashtags and tildes.</figcaption></figure><p>David Price / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some PC keyboards in the U.K. have a dedicated hash key on the right, above Shift, and to the left of Return. If this keyboard was connected to a Windows machine, hitting this button would generate a # (and a ~ when used with Shift). But because you’ve connected a PC keyboard to a Mac–which is possible, and will work fine a lot of the time–the differences in layout confuse macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, your Mac is misinterpreting the keyboard’s hash symbol as a backslash. We’d recommend that you get a proper Mac keyboard., but in the meantime, you can type hashtags using your PC keyboard/Mac combo by pressing <strong>Alt + 3</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more keyboard tips, see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671016/how-type-at-euro-hash-special-characters-mac.html\">How to type Æ, €, #, @, © and other special characters on a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5e05591462bc9e2061117aa103266342f6d2845b0c52fbfe23abe9f61ecf77b1","category":"Apple"}
