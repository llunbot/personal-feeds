This year, the summer wave began earlier and, by some metrics, is peaking at much higher levels than in previous years.</p>\n<p>Currently, wastewater detection of SARS-CoV-2 shows \"very high\" virus levels in 32 states and the District of Colombia. An additional 11 states are listed as having \"high\" levels. Looking at trends, the southern and western regions of the country are currently reporting SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater that rival the 2022–2023 and 2023–2024 winter waves, which both peaked at the very end of December.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044101#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044101&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"490c9d6c1f039df627d1a1bebd62f30097791d0f33f2c50e5bc14a07d9fac13b","category":"Tech"}
