Affected users are unable to view any emails in their inboxes, and the app can also become glitchy and unresponsive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue does not appear to be tied to any specific iPhone model, and the underlying cause is unknown. Most if not all affected users said their iPhones were running iOS 18.5, but it is unclear why online discussion about this issue only started to gain traction within the past few days, given that the update was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/\">released more than three weeks ago</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAffected users said restarting their iPhones temporarily solves the issue, but a permanent solution has yet to be identified. <em>MacRumors</em> has emailed Apple about the matter, and we will update this story if and when the company responds to the inquiry.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue is not reflected on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\">Apple's system status page</a> as of writing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Thanks, Steve Ryan!</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-mail/\">Apple Mail</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/iphone-mail-app-blank-screen-ios-18-5/\">iPhone Users Say Mail App Suddenly Showing Blank Screen on iOS 18.5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-users-say-mail-app-suddenly-showing-blank-screen-on-ios-18-5.2458234/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"824b33c39911dd9be2201214dca9c64d8b5905210bd27997dd81680b712f6ef9","category":"Apple"}
