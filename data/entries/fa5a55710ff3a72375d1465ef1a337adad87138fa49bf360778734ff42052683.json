Situated in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland, the island spans 52km by 23km, making it just slightly more than one third the size of Hertfordshire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is home to about 86,000 people, and while it may have a reputation for attracting tax evaders and petrolheads, I am here for the cycling and to gain an insight into how the island has bred some of the best British cyclists over the years, a certain Manx Missile and Millie Robinson coming to mind.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gravel-cycling-scotland\">Wee bit hill and glen: Scotland gravel ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/deep-in-the-forest-northern-ireland-ride\">Deep in the forest: Northern Ireland gravel ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 137: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h4>Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge sportive at a glance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Choice of three routes: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Full circle (100 miles/161km with over 2,000m ascent)</li><li>Half circle (51 miles/82km, 1,500m ascent)  </li><li>Quarter circle (26 miles/42km, 620m ascent)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Entry costs £36, £31 and £25 respectively.

There are three route options – 100 miles/161km, 51 miles/82km and 26 miles/42km – and anyone on any sort of bike is welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve been trying to push e-bikes and leisure cyclists,’ says organiser Ollie Last. ‘That’s why we have three routes, so that more people can get involved and try it for themselves. This year we have had 80 riders doing the quarter route, which is double the normal number.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-02-776x970.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-02-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-02-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-02-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-02-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-02-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Covid saw a huge boost in cycling but that has tapered off, so with these different routes we’re trying to bring new people into the sport, in whatever way suits them.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we join the start line beneath some seriously moody clouds, I can see the plan has paid off. The range of bikes is extensive, from classic road racer to fat-tyred e-mountain bike, to the forgotten-at-the-back-of-the-garage old faithful. My eyes flit across the 360-strong field. There are a lot of men, many of them wearing eclectic, colourful jerseys, along with a fair few youngsters and a decent sprinkling of women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clock hits seven and we’re off out of Douglas, curling our way up towards Marine Drive, a magnificent coastal road that has been closed to traffic since 1977 due to cliff-falls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fact I discovered yesterday, when I got my first taste of the island on a ride with Richard Fletcher, non-executive director for Visit Isle of Man and a prominent champion for cycling on the island. Rolling along, I notice many places beginning with the word ‘Balla’, this is Manx for ‘home of’, with people who buy holiday homes here naming them in Manx. A popular choice is ‘Thie Veg’ which technically means ‘little house’, but colloquially means ‘little toilet’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-03-970x776.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-03-970x776.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-03-300x240.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-03-768x614.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-03-750x600.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-03-1140x912.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Thie Vegs aside, our recon weaves through narrow country lanes, a stunning view over Douglas to our right and a trio of mountains looming ahead. Richard says the one in the middle is Snaefell, the highest mountain on the island. From the top on a clear day you can sometimes see the ‘seven kingdoms’: England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and the kingdoms of heaven and the sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the Lighthouses Challenge skirts the coastline, we won’t be hitting anything like that altitude today, but the event still delivers several climbing tests. The first comes quickly – straight out of Douglas the gradient kicks up aggressively as we pass under the impressive arched former tollgate with its castle-like turrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, everyone is chatty at this early stage, the lady next to me revealing that she moved here from Liverpool a few years ago for work and now can’t see herself leaving. The sea lies beneath a steep drop to the left and the view is magnificent – not just the strikingly rugged land laid out before us, but also the sea of cyclists bobbing up and down along the coastline.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>After dipping down to the Sound, the island’s southernmost tip, it’s a brutal burn to come all the way back up</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I find myself riding beside a yellow jersey-clad local. We remark on the sheer variety of people who have turned up to take part in the event, and discuss how e-bikes are great for promoting mobility and getting more people involved in the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A succession of short, sharp hills follow and no sooner have I finished harping on about how great e-bikes are when one whizzes past as we battle a devilishly sneaky 17% gradient that seems to have come out of nowhere. My new friend laughs and says, ‘And now you hate them, right?’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Castle in the wind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we head towards the southernmost tip of the island I encounter people who have come from all over to ride the sportive – from the Lake District, Mauritius, even Australia – and of course plenty of locals. The wind is really bellowing on the flat section into Castletown, and my poor little ears begin to lament my choice to forgo a more protective form of headwear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We pass King William’s College, the island’s only private school and an enormous structure that looks out of place – the carefully curated lawns don’t seem to fit in with the rest of the island’s more rugged demeanour. We follow the promenade all the way along the edge of the airport, where I’m told Lewis Hamilton’s private jet is registered (though never seen), and make a swift U-turn at Cafe Bar Two Six to head towards the Sound. There are plenty of people lining the roadside, waving bells, blowing whistles and banging buckets. It is quite the occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we head up towards the Sound on the southern tip of the island, my gaze falls on a steep ascent lying ahead. A friendly steward ensures we cross a main road safely and just as I begin the climb up Mull Hill he says, ‘Oh yes, now that is a hill’. This is not the encouragement I am looking for. A slow and steady grind begins and just as I near the top, a man in front clambers off his bike and calls to his friend in disgust, ‘I absolutely hate this hill, every time I do it.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A vibrant array of cyclists on all sorts of bikes lines up in the island’s capital, Douglas, to begin the sportive</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Finally we crest the top and descend towards the Sound, a smaller version of New Zealand’s but still glorious. The island’s jagged coastline is on full display, as is the Calf of Man, a very small island that is a haven for birdwatchers and home to no fewer than four lighthouses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We race down to sea level… only to turn around at the bottom and come all the way back up again. The wind soon falls stagnant as the speed drops and I join a group of riders heaving themselves out of the saddle to make the climb. A blonde-haired girl zooms past us, easing her way around the bunched group and pedalling on. I never see her again. She must have been about 12. They really are a different breed here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We drop down via an abrupt descent, although there are plenty of stewards lining the narrow road to ensure we don’t career off into the brambles. Still, I’m relieved when Port Erin reveals itself and the road levels out. This is also where the Quarter route ends so there’s plenty going on at the first feed station.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The sportive offers majestic views of the island’s rugged coastline. with traditional dry stone walls in abundance</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After shovelling in several homemade delights and sloshing down some squash, I head out again and the running commentary from my riding compatriots continues when I hear an elderly female rider say, ‘My buttocks need rubbing.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Four-horned sheep</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a long slow-burner of a leg towards the next major town, Peel. The route includes The Sloc, a notorious Isle of Man climb but one made considerably more palatable by the majestic scenery and the possibility of catching sight of an Isle of Man icon: the Manx Loaghtan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rare breed of sheep native to the island, they have dark brown wool and four horns – some extra-rare ones even have six. I’m told they are a hardy breed and able to survive in harsh conditions, traits I’m beginning to think run in the water here. Much to my dismay, the closest I get to seeing one is an indistinguishable shape far in the distance. The local rider pointing it out could be looking at anything for all I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On reaching Peel – which is famous for its castle – and discovering its ice-cream shop, there’s another parting of the ways as the 82km Half route deviates back to Douglas while the rest of us continue north.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The northern part of the island is much easier-going with gentle rolling hills, and to improve things further, the sun has come out to play. It’s a flat road out to the Point of Ayre lighthouse, which lies at the northern tip of the island, then we turn south and head back in the direction of Douglas. A formidable late kick comes just after Laxey in the form of Creg Ny Baa, serving up a 16% gradient with about 20km to go.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Supporters line the road as riders whip into Castletown, whose harbour is home to the World Tin Bath Championships</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The final climb takes us up towards the edge of the famous TT course. Barriers are lined up against the stone walls, and while the thought of crashing into one of those on a motorbike fills me with horror, I can see why people ride here. The road is effortlessly playful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we roll down into Douglas, a tribute band is playing some old-school tunes, the bassist resplendent in a Hawaiian shirt. People are milling about, beers in hand and bicycles are everywhere. Not bad for a small island.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h3></h3>\n\n\n\n<h2>Four things to know before you go</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>‘Gow kiarail er y jough night’ means ‘take care on the beer tonight’…</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The final push up Creg Ny Baa towards the edge of the famous TT course presents one last leg test before it is downhill to the finish in Douglas</figcaption><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>1. Speaking Manx</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Celtic language closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic, Manx was once spoken by almost the entire population of the Isle of Man but declined when the island was sold to the British Crown in 1765.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In more recent years the language has seen a revival and in 1985 the island’s parliament passed a resolution giving Manx limited official recognition for the first time. UNESCO declared it extinct in 2009 but after a vigorous protest from native speakers, reclassified it as critically endangered. Latest figures show about 2,200 people speak, read or write Manx.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. The Three Legs of Mann</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The national symbol of the Isle of Man is the Three Legs of Mann, a triskelion of three legs joined at the thigh and which are usually running clockwise. The symbol appears on the island’s flag, coins and coat of arms, and is often accompanied by the Isle’s motto <i>Quocunque jeceris stabit</i>: ‘whichever way you throw it, it will stand’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Three Legs’ origins are uncertain, but some say it dates from as far back as the Iron Age and was a symbol of the sun, power and life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Manx cat</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Believed to have originated on the island, the Manx cat is distinctive for being tailless. This is a result of a degenerative gene that causes spina bifida (shortening of the spine), which can damage the nerves, bowels, bladder and digestive system. The most affected breed is the Rumpy cat, which is completely tailless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is said that to avoid this, the Rumpy can be bred with the Stumpy Manx cat, which has a tail stump. There are two other breeds of Manx cat, the Rumpy-riser (which has a small knob of a tail) and the Longy, which looks like a normal cat. Manx cats are known to enjoy a game of fetch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Safety first</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a global survey in June 2022, the Isle of Man was ranked the fourth-safest place to live, and the safest place in the British Isles thanks to its low crime rate. According to several locals it is not uncommon for people to leave their cars and houses unlocked, something that’s attributed to the strong sense of community on the island. Should anything untoward happen, I’m told that ‘all the troops’ get deployed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Isle of Man Lighthouses Challenge Sportive\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/isle-of-man-lighthouses-challenge-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alice Alphrey</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flights to Ronaldsway Airport near Castletown on the Isle of Man go from London (Loganair, EasyJet), Liverpool (Loganair, EasyJet), Bristol (EasyJet) and Edinburgh (Loganair), and take on average an hour and a half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During summer a ferry operates between Douglas and Liverpool, which takes two hours and 45 minutes to reach the island, while a year-round ferry operates from Heysham, taking three and a half hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The start and finish of the Lighthouses Challenge was in Douglas, which is a short ride from most places on the island, but for the 2023 edition the event will start and finish in Castletown, making it even easier to get to from the airport. To get around the island, we hired a car from Mylchreests Motors Ltd, which we picked up and dropped off at the airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at Ballavartyn Holiday Homes, set within the grounds of an equestrian centre. The self-catered homes are a five-minute drive from Douglas and Castletown, and close to the airport and sea terminal. Prices start from £105. See <a href=\"https://ballavartyn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ballavartyn.com</a> for details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to Visit Isle of Man for hosting us, to Richard Fletcher for all his local knowledge and to Ollie Last for welcoming us to the sportive.
