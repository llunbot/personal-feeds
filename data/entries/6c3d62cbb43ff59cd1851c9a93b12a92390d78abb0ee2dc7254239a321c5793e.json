It also brought the higher-end 48-megapixel camera sensor and the Always-On display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDan goes into depth on how the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max (used caseless!) has held up over the course of the last 11 months, what battery life is like, and how the latest feature set has worked out for him. The video provides an thoughtful retrospective on a year with Apple's flagship <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as we head into ‌iPhone‌ launch season.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe're expecting the ‌iPhone 15‌ models to come out in September as usual. The standard models won't get much in the way of an upgrade aside from a transition to the ‌Dynamic Island‌ and a USB-C port, but we can expect slimmer bezels, faster chips, and a periscope telephoto lens for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max that will replace the 14 Pro Max.
