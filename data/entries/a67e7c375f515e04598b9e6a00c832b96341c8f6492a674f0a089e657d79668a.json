With the right accessories a computer can tell you where you are when you get lost, how many watts you’re struggling to put out, and even when it’s time to stop for a piece of cake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built on the infrastructure of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-it-s-better-without-gps\">GPS positioning satellites</a>, the best bike computers increasingly offer smartphone-style features and extensive ride and performance analysis alongside simple speed and distance data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might include mapping and navigation, previews of upcoming climbs, or even the ability to see the fastest times set by other riders on the stretch you’re currently pedalling along. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For riders searching for these features, the bike computer market has come to be dominated by Wahoo and Garmin. However, there are still smaller brands worth considering. The main thing is to decide why you are buying a computer in the first place. If you want outstanding mapping that can guide you on and off-road, you’ll need to look towards options that boast navigation capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a data junkie, you will need to assess the connectivity of the device. However, if you are solely using the computer to upload your ride to Strava, you may be better served by a more budget option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you’ll find our guide to what we consider the best bike computers on the market, alongside advice on understanding their features and how to pick the best one for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best bike computers

href=\"https://tidd.ly/3WERyd3\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy to configure and use</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>32GB storage</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Excellent app integration</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The big boss of Wahoo’s GPS cycling computer range, the Roam had an upgrade in October 2022 and the V2 includes multi-band GNSS satellite fixes for improved accuracy, a 64-colour screen and 32GB of memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the original, it boasts onboard rerouting and on-demand route generation that partners with existing functions such as routing you to a pre-downloaded course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Roam has also received climbing profiles – or Summit Segments as Wahoo calls them. Much like the higher end Garmins and the Hammerhead Karoo, climbs are colour-graded according to steepness and pop up when approaching an ascent on both pre-mapped and unmapped routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On GPS setup, you are prompted to download the Elemnt app which acts as the central hub for all the necessary information and data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app integration is seamless and makes up for what the computer lacks in touch-screen technology. Screen profiles, options and data fields can be changed easily through the app and sync automatically when both devices are turned on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take mapping, for example. After creating my route on a third-party app such as Strava or Ride With GPS, the route automatically synced to my pre-downloaded Elemnt Roam App and then onto the computer through Bluetooth in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo says that the new dual-band GPS is more precise and good for riding under dense tree cover or around tall buildings. The navigation system works well, but lacks heatmaps, so can lead you out onto busier roads to get you from A to B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roam has a respectable battery life of 17 hours, even at full functionality, despite the added storage capacity. A top-drawer product, but if you’re happy with a smaller screen the Bolt 2.0 still does pretty much the same job for £100 less. More details below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 2.7in; <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 17 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> Multi-band GNSS, GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 95g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Easy setup, tight app integration</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our

Garmin Edge 1050 has the same screen size as the Edge 1040 (see below), but it’s brighter and very touch-responsive, with more detailed maps. The 64GB of storage means there’s loads of capacity for maps and ride data, although unlike the Edge 1040 (and the 840 and 540), there’s no solar charging option and battery life has decreased to 20 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin has worked hard on its setup process, which is now the match of Wahoo’s and will transfer your configuration over if you’re upgrading from a previous Garmin model. The home screen makes getting started, checking the weather from your phone, finding Strava segments or changing the setup easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin has added a speaker, which is used to direct you when navigating and also serves as a digital bell when you tap the screen. There’s also Garmin Pay onboard, so you can pay for your mid-ride coffee, although there are relatively few UK banks that can be used. There’s connectivity if you carry your phone to manage group rides, ride tracking, alerts from the phone and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an impressive piece of kit, with loads of functionality for ride tracking and training, although with a big pricetag and significant bulk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 3.5in; <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 20 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> Multi-band GNSS, GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 160g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Speaker for verbal directions and works as a bike bell, indoor trainer control, training support</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-edge-1050-gps-bike-computer-review\">Garmin Edge 1050 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wahoo Elemnt Ace: Large screen and wind sensor</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-970x643.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-1536x1019.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-2048x1359.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-1140x756.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£599.99 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Wahoo-Elemnt-Ace-GPS-Computer_271880.htm\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Large format with 3.8 inch touchscreen</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Easy setup and configuration via phone app</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integrated wind speed measurement</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wahoo Elemnt Ace is the largest cycling computer from a mainstream brand, with a 3.8-inch colour touchscreen (the first touchscreen in a Wahoo computer) but is also significantly heavier than the competition. Wahoo has the same array of buttons as on its Roam and Bolt cycling computers and offers its Perfect Zoom feature too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elemnt Ace’s headline feature is the integrated wind pressure sensor built into the front of the unit. Wahoo uses this to display wind speed and indicate if you’re riding in a headwind or a tailwind and the effect of drafting. You can see a breakdown of wind assistance/resistance and where on your route each occurred in the Wahoo app once you finish your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo continues to offer configuration via a smartphone, making for easy changes in setup. The font is impressively clear too, so you can pack your screen with data fields or view a detailed map with directions, which are also relayed orally via the built-in speaker. As with the Garmin Edge 1050, the speaker also serves as a bike bell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of January 2025, the Wahoo Elemnt Ace doesn’t offer live tracking and group ride functionality, although this is scheduled to be delivered along with a range of other enhancements during 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 3.8in; <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 30 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> Multi-band GNSS, GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 208g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Touchscreen, wind pressure sensor</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review coming soon, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\">subscribe</a> to see it first</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Garmin Edge 840 Solar: Huge range of features in a compact package</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin Edge 840 Solar\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Garmin-Edge-840-Solar-11-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£519.99 | <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3XYhJe5\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solar charging option</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-band GNSS location fix</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Responsive touchscreen interface</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin’s latest Edge 840 and 540 bike computers share much of the functionality of its premium Edge 1040 in a smaller format. That includes solar charging, with a brown surround to the 2.6in colour touchscreen and a thinner, transparent coating on the screen itself collecting the sun’s rays to boost the unit’s run time, in the case of the Edge 840 Solar to a claimed 32 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a non-solar option that shaves £70 off the list price, which we’d suggest might be a better purchase for UK riders and those not into epic adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features include multi-band GNSS for a more accurate location fix, a switch to the ‘Glances’-based home screen, which gives you a customisable choice of key summary stats, and on-the-fly climb profiles. There’s the same responsive touchscreen interface as the previous model Edge 830, augmented by an array of seven buttons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Routes are transferred seamlessly to the Edge 840 from the Garmin Connect phone app, which also allows you to customise your bike computer.

As it is, switching from mapping on your phone to that on a bike computer is like going from an iMac to an Amstrad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the Android operating system, with 64GB of storage, and including free access to worldwide mapping, the Karoo aims to bridge the gap between the two experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering turn-by-turn navigation both on and off-road, the Karoo’s base map offers a significant level of detail, with nearby points of interest from cafes to toilets all flagged. Hit a climb and it will bring up the oncoming elevation, while it’s also possible to drop a pin and have the unit quickly create a route to it. Unlike other units, searching and sorting routes and locations is easy, partly thanks to the unit’s in-built QWERTY keyboard. If you aren’t riding a preplanned route, you still get climb profiles on the fly, although that’s functionality now matched by all the best bike computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very much positioning itself as a tech firm rather than a hardware maker, Hammerhead (now owned by SRAM) promises to provide fortnightly updates to the unit’s firmware and functionality. The third generation Karoo was launched in May 2024. It adds Multi-Band GPS support, rivalling Garmin and Wahoo, includes a more powerful processor and provides tight integration to the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS</a> groupset and a more comprehensive phone app. While the Karoo 2’s battery life lagged behind its rivals at around 8 hours, the new Karoo has increased this to over 15 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 3.2in; <strong>Battery life:</strong> 15 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 167g; <strong>Other features:</strong> High-res screen</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-3-gps-bike-computer-review\">Hammerhead Karoo 3 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Garmin Edge 1040 Solar: Every feature under the sun</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"best bike computers number 4: garmin edge 1040 solar\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120744/garmin-edge-1040-solar-4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£608 |<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3TUzsBV\" target=\"_blank\"> View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solar charging contributes to huge runtime</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-band GNSS for position accuracy</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Garmin 1040’s party trick is its solar charging capability (there’s also a cheaper non-solar version), which adds significantly to its already long battery life, giving you 45 hours claimed runtime with all functions running and up to 100 hours in its most pared-down GPS mode. The solar screen is slightly difficult to read though, due to its internal coating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes with multi-band GNSS satellite tracking, which ups the accuracy of its GPS trace (something that’s included in the latest version of the Wahoo Elemnt Roam and the lower priced Edge x40 models too).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin’s touchscreen works really well wet or dry, with or without gloves and the large 3.5-inch diagonal means that you can see plenty of data fields. The maps have lots of detail and it’s very quick to upload a course to follow. Popularity-based routing means that you’ll be kept to cycle-friendly routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Edge 1040 gives you loads of ride stats, including Stamina, which keeps tabs on your energy expenditure as your ride and tells you how much you’ve got left in the tank.

If you carry your phone with you, you’ll get incoming messages and call alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The base map is clear and easy to follow with turn-by-turn directions from uploaded routes, while the unit’s data screens are easily configurable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S800 is good value as standard but another £50 will also get you an additional ANT+/Bluetooth speed and cadence sensor plus a heart rate strap, making it an even better deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 3.4in; <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 36 hours;<strong> Location:</strong> GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidou, QZSS; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 104g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Touchscreen</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bryton-rider-s800-computer-review\">Bryton Rider S800 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Garmin Edge 540 Solar: Big features on a smaller budget</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Eds-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"best bike computers number 6: Garmin Edge 540\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/garmin-edge-540-solar-1.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£379.99 (RRP £429.99) | <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3VM1K1H\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Same functionality as Garmin’s higher priced Edge 840</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Button-only interface</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin’s lowest priced bike computer in its newest Edge x40 range, the Edge 540 is the same size as the Edge 840 above, but uses buttons rather than including a touchscreen.

It also links up to Garmin’s Varia rearview radars to alert you to approaching traffic and uses Garmin’s cycling-specific popularity routing to keep you off high traffic routes in the first place. It will alert you to a high traffic road ahead and even to sharp bends and steep descents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most functions work well without the touchscreen, although a few such as panning around maps are fiddly. It’s also quite easy to press a button accidentally while using the Edge 540 when riding. As with the Edge 840, in our review we questioned the usefulness of solar charging, at least in the UK. That led us to suggest that the non-solar 840 was a better purchase at the same list price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen size:</strong> 2.6in; <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 32 hours; <strong>Location:</strong> Multi-band GNSS, GPS, Glonass, Galileo; <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi; <strong>Weight:</strong> 86g; <strong>Other features:</strong> Solar charging option, button operation only</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-edge-540-solar-review\">Garmin Edge 540 Solar review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Garmin Edge 540</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Garmin Edge 540 Solar</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wahoo Elemnt Bolt 2.0: The one for racers</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"738\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop-970x738.jpg\" alt=\"best bike computers number 7: wahoo elemnt bolt\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop-970x738.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop-300x228.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop-768x584.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop-1536x1168.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop-750x571.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop-1140x867.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06133213/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop.jpg 1918w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£265.92 | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zSJtsF\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compact aerodynamic shape</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>LED lights can be programmed for additional information in-ride</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elemnt Bolt is a bike computer for those who race.

Most will also allow you to preload routes to follow and many will even allow you to renavigate on the fly, although compared to using your phone the search function can often feel a bit clunky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart notifications: </strong>Smart notifications are when you sync the bike computer to your phone and receive notifications on the go. Most will send through messages and call alerts allowing you to keep tabs on what’s going on without having to reach for your back pocket. Many will also transmit data back to your phone, letting your contacts follow your ride and alerting them if something is wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Battery life: </strong>If you plan to spend long days in the saddle exploring then you will need to look at options with healthy battery life. Most cycling computers will last up to 18 hours albeit when used conservatively, many much longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sensor compatibility: </strong>This could be an external power meter, heart rate monitor or cadence sensor. If you want to use any of these, you should check the computer’s ability to connect to sensors and devices. Some only allow connection to one at a time but most allow multiple connections using ANT+ and/or Bluetooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So you’ve got one of the best bike computers, but you can’t measure your watts?
