The hire, now working as a product design engineer at Apple at its \"Special Projects Group,\" also previously worked at Porsche, undertaking similar responsibilities. A second engineer who previously worked at Mercedes has also recently been tapped by Apple to join the company, <em>MacRumors</em> has learned.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Car‌, internally codenamed \"Project Titan,\" is one of the company's most secretive projects. Despite a myriad of rumors, Apple's ultimate goal in the automotive space remains unclear. The most recent hires by Apple joins a list of former engineers and executives the Cupertino tech giant has tapped in from some of the world's largest car makers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs the company continues to build up its workforce with skills and talents needed to produce and develop a car, Apple has also had several setbacks.

Apple is reportedly in discussions with several suppliers, including its most significant, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/11/apple-car-contract-manufacturers-possibility/\">Foxconn</a>, and carmakers regarding a partnership. The talks and discussions have so far not materialized into any formal deal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFoxconn, which serves as the mass producer for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, is likely to be tapped to play <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/foxconn-electric-vehicle-ambitions/\">some role in the supply chain of an Apple Car</a>, said to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/apple-car-launch-5-to-7-years-away/\">at least half a decade away</a>.
