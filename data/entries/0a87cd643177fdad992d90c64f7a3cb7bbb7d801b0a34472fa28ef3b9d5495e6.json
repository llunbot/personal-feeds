It has a woefully underdeveloped refueling infrastructure in the US, being almost nonexistent outside of California, and even there, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/retail-h2-stations-close-in-california-while-h2-heavy-trucking-expands/\">retail hydrogen stations are closing down</a>. And hydrogen prices fluctuate like crazy, with recent costs hitting $33 per kilogram, when you can even get it. In short, it seems like a weird time for a company to introduce a new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, but that's just what Honda is doing with its awkwardly named CR-V e:FCEV.</p>\n<p>The fuel cell CR-V is unique in a few ways that make it interesting, the biggest of which is that it's effectively a plug-in hybrid, only instead of an internal combustion engine being paired with an electric drivetrain, this has a fuel cell powering a 17.7 kWh battery pack and a traction motor that bears more resemblance to one you'd find in an EV than in a traditional PHEV. Cool, right?</p>\n<p>The biggest question that we have is simply why?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011097#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011097&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a87cd643177fdad992d90c64f7a3cb7bbb7d801b0a34472fa28ef3b9d5495e6","category":"Tech"}
