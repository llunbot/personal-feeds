The clever design holds your bike while you pump up the tires, but I’m not sure the non-drive side pedal would clear it for spinning the cranks for minor maintenance, cleaning, or tuning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a two-stage pump, filling up high-volume tires quickly, then switching to a high-pressure pump for finishing off-road bike tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Topeak prepstand T3X bike work stand mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/topeak-prepstand-t3x-clamp-free-bike-workstand-03.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Topeak Prepstand T3X is a three-axis frame mount that doesn’t clamp to your seatpost to hold your bike.
