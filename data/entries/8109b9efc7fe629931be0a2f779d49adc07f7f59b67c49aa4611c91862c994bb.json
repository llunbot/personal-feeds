That's when the county health department began using court orders to try to compel her to get her deadly respiratory infection treated and/or remain in isolation to protect the public until she is no longer infectious.</p>\n<p>Pierce County Superior Court Judge Philip Sorensen ruled once again Friday that the woman—known only by the initials \"V.N.\" in court documents—was in contempt of those court orders. Sorensen had initially issued a civil arrest warrant on March 2, 2023, ordering her to involuntary detention for testing and treatment. He extended the warrant Friday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941465#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941465&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8109b9efc7fe629931be0a2f779d49adc07f7f59b67c49aa4611c91862c994bb","category":"Tech"}
