It has all the trademark \"gamer\" laser-beam design language and pointless LEDs, but also some really wild engineering additions when it comes to cooling your super-hot gaming phone.</p>\n<p>Specs include a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and—the highlight of the spec sheet—a whopping 6000 mAh battery with 65 W charging. The display is a 165 Hz,  6.78-inch, 2448×1080 Samsung AMOLED. The phone has two USB-C ports, one on the side and one on the bottom, along with a headphone jack. There are three rear cameras, a 50 MP main camera, a 13 MP wide-angle, and a 5 MP macro, while the front camera is 32 MP.</p>\n<p>There are two models here, the ROG Phone 7 and ROG Phone 7 Ultimate. The specs are the same; the ultimate just adds a rear \"ROG Vision\" display. This is a 2-inch OLED display with six different modes to show things like the time, charging level, an incoming call, or a few purely aesthetic animations. The Ultimate model also interfaces better with a clip-on fan accessory, the \"AeroActive Cooler 7.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931480#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931480&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"216bd727fa1cf3bacb71765838c93fc46c77f0297e4be0c0a76d86493922d938","category":"Tech"}
