HCS is now being deprecated for our on-demand customers. At the end of 2022, we reached out to HCS customers regarding this change and are working with customers on migrating their HCS clusters to the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) to ensure the continued operation of their Consul clusters. </p>\n\n<p>We encourage you to clean up any HCS related resources in your Azure subscription to prevent incurring additional costs. In the coming weeks, HashiCorp will start to shut down remaining clusters.</p>\n\n<p>Users can now enjoy the benefits of <a href=\"https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-up\">HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Consul on Azure</a>, which offers a simplified service mesh architecture for Consul and significant improvements in user experience. With HCP Consul, users can enjoy hassle-free Consul deployments and scale their service mesh and service discovery capabilities more efficiently across multiple environments. This provides users with an enhanced experience while reducing the burden of managing infrastructure and associated costs.</p>\n\n<p>We are dedicated to assisting all our customers in this transition. HashiCorp is committed to providing a multi-cloud experience that will enable you to effectively scale service mesh and service discovery in your organization.
