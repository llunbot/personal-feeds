But the Jumbo-Visma racer had a life-altering crash – fracturing vertebrae, collarbone, shoulder &amp; more during the Tour of the Basque Country road race just days before the first XCO race of 2022. He literally spent half a year in rehab, but was surprisingly able to return to racing on &amp; off-road last year – <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cervelo-zht-5-xc-hardtail-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">debuting the Cervélo hardtail</a> in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cervélo ZFS-5 carbon full-suspension XC mountain bike, Cervelo ZFS XCO MTB race-ready, Milan Vader\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Milan-Vader.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now he is back on the World Cup, joined by new teammate and current Cyclocross World Champion Fem van Empel, both set to race the new fully on the notoriously techy Nové Město XCO course this weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, onto the bike…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details &amp; Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cervélo ZFS-5 carbon full-suspension XC mountain bike, Cervelo ZFS XCO MTB race-ready, wet berm riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_wet-cornering.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Cervélo is going all-in with XC mountain bike racing aboard the all-new ZFS-5 full-suspension bike.

And for riders looking to go slacker, they can shift to a 66.6° headtube in the 120mm variant.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_floating-rear-brake.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_floating-rear-brake-800x652.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cervélo ZFS-5 carbon full-suspension XC mountain bike, Cervelo ZFS XCO MTB race-ready, floating rear brake mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_floating-rear-brake-800x652.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_floating-rear-brake-297x242.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_floating-rear-brake-120x98.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_floating-rear-brake-768x626.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_floating-rear-brake.jpg 1350w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One trickier bit in the suspension, Cervélo describes the post mount rear brake as ‘floating’ as it attaches to the chainstay and then the axle, to isolate it from the suspension flex around the drop-out and lower-end of the seatstay. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_threaded-bottom-bracket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"615\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_threaded-bottom-bracket-800x615.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cervélo ZFS-5 carbon full-suspension XC mountain bike, Cervelo ZFS XCO MTB race-ready, main pivot &amp; threaded bottom bracket, BSA BB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_threaded-bottom-bracket-800x615.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_threaded-bottom-bracket-297x228.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_threaded-bottom-bracket-120x92.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_threaded-bottom-bracket-768x591.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_threaded-bottom-bracket.jpg 1300w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbon full-suspension bike sticks with a threaded bottom bracket for usability, a 30.9 seatpost with stealth dropper routing, full internal cable routing through the 1.5″ headset, UDH compatibility with the latest direct mount SRAM Eagle AXS Transmission derailleurs, and gets two sets of bottle cage mounts inside the main triangle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cervélo ZFS-5 carbon full-suspension XC mountain bike, Cervelo ZFS XCO MTB race-ready, 100mm or 120mm geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_100mm-or-120mm-geometry.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One more interesting detail though is that Cervélo have shared two sets of geometry for two different travel options – 100mm or 120mm, presumably for cross-country or marathon racing. While it’s not uncommon to slap a longer fork on an XC race bike to slacken it out for more comfortable long-distance mountain bike racing, the 120mm geo is slacker BUT shares the same bottom bracket drop. That suggests that there is either a flip-chip somewhere that we haven’t been able to spot, or there might be 2 different linkages for the separate travel options, which could also allow for rear travel variation too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cervélo ZFS-5 carbon full-suspension XC mountain bike, Cervelo ZFS XCO MTB race-ready, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_Martin-Vader-rainy-riding.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure, I’ll find out this weekend!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cervélo ZFS-5 – Options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Cervélo ZFS-5 carbon full-suspension XC mountain bike, Cervelo ZFS XCO MTB race-ready, muddy complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cervelo-ZFS-5-carbon-full-suspension-XC-mountain-bike_XCO-MTB_muddy-complete-bike.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, pricing hasn’t been set for the new full-suspension Cervélo ZFS-5 XC bike.
