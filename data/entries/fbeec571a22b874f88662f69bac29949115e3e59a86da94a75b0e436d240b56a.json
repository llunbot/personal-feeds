That auto show should have taken place this week, but for the second year running, COVID had something to say about that. Which is a shame because this year the luxury Korean automaker would have shown off a new car far more interesting than another concept car (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/this-little-electric-car-is-the-coolest-thing-at-the-ny-auto-show/\">even one as cool as 2019's Mint</a>). That's because this is no concept.</p>\n<p>I've been waiting for Genesis to show off its first production electric vehicle, and this is it. It's called the GV60, and it should go on sale in the US in 2022, underpinned by parent company Hyundai Motor Group's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/everything-we-know-about-hyundai-and-kias-new-electric-vehicle-platform/\">new E-GMP platform</a>.</p>\n<p>Genesis hasn't released any technical specs of the GV60 yet. But we know that the E-GMP platform—also used to build the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/this-crisp-looking-crossover-is-hyundais-next-ev-the-ioniq-5/\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/kia-shares-more-details-about-its-electric-ev6-due-in-early-2022/\">Kia EV6</a>—uses an 800 V electrical architecture, which makes it possible to fast-charge the battery to 80 percent in 18 minutes. A clever inverter also supports 400 V DC fast charging and bidirectional charging, using the EV's battery pack to supply up to 3.5 kW of AC power.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788444#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788444&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
