Challenge was quietly at work over the past year, working on just that — the Challenge Getaway XP (Extra Protection) for endurance rides on rougher terrains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tire is part of Challenges’ new reinforced Gravel XP Series, which focuses on all those looking for an overall robust and durable tire, without compromising comfort and handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To arm the new XP Series of tires, Challenge opted for a bead-to-bead makeover of protection and compound to enhance its new endurance tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-compounds-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-compounds--800x286.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire compounds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-compounds--800x286.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-compounds--297x106.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-compounds--120x43.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-compounds--768x274.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-compounds-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>All New Corazza Armor Gold</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Corazza Armor Gold is a particular layer of tightly woven material on the tire that helps reinforce it under aggressive conditions. The new Getaway XP is the first Challenge tire to have the Corazza Armor Gold, but all tires in the XP Series will share this technology moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-side-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-side--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire tread side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-side--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-side--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-side--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-side--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-side-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge SmartPlus Compound</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Getaway XP has a special higher durometer natural rubber than others in the Challenge line called SmartPlus Compound. While providing reduced wear and enhanced durability, the SmartPlus rubber compound retains all the natural rubber properties. Offering grip, shock absorption, control, and reduced rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-inside-tire-carcass-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-inside-tire-carcass--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire inside tire carcass\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-inside-tire-carcass--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-inside-tire-carcass--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-inside-tire-carcass--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-inside-tire-carcass--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-inside-tire-carcass-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Chafer Aramid Bead Protection Strip</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getaway XP includes a bead protection strip to aid in tire life by reducing the effects of rubbing against the rim’s carbon bead hooks. The black chafer also acts as a precise line around the rim to confirm the tire is seated when inflating.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-clearance-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-clearance--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-clearance--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-clearance--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-clearance--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-clearance--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-clearance-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-new Challenge Getaway XP will be available in 40 and 45mm Handmade Tubeless Ready and Hookless compatible. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $94.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sizes: </strong>40mm and 45mm </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 632g – 45mm </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Available:</strong> June 3rd 2023</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-mounted-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-mounted--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-mounted--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-mounted--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-mounted--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-mounted--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-mounted-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Challenge Getaway — First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Challenge Getaway XP is a handmade open tubular, so it’s different than most gravel tires on the market. The XP casing creates a thick, more robust tire, keeping the handmade tubular (cotton) feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-flop-tire-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-flop-tire--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire flop tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-flop-tire--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-flop-tire--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-flop-tire--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-flop-tire--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-flop-tire-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The casing is very supple to the touch but notably thicker than all Challenge tires I’ve ridden. The tread sits high on the tire’s carcass but comes down enough to offer legit cornering knobs. The shoulder knobs are enough for digging into the mud when sunk in but not as large as the Chicane, as to feel overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-side-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-side--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-side--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-side--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-side--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-side--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-side-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Challenge Getaway — Set up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up open-tubular tires can be tricky, especially when they are wide, like the Challenge Getaway XP 45mm tires. You have to have a plan of attack, and with unreleased tires, usually, that plan has yet to be discovered. For me, the plan was to get the full tire over the rim and then push the bead on from over the top. Since the tire is flatter than most, this tactic seemed the best. After wrestling with it for a minute, the first side went on, and I knew I was dialed. The second side popped into place, and I was good to inflate — no compressor needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-measured-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-measured--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire measured\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-measured--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-measured--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-measured--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-measured--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-measured-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I installed the Challenge Getaway XPs on; Roval Terra CLX II, CADEX 36 (hookless), and Bontrager RSL 36 wheels. The tires were easy enough to install on all the aforementioned, especially on the hookless wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-weight-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"736\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-weight--800x736.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-weight--800x736.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-weight--297x273.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-weight--120x110.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-weight--768x706.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-weight-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tires inflated to a nice 46mm at 30 PSI on the Roval Terra CLX II and are just enough volume to max out (with mud wiggle room) the clearance in my 2022 Specialized Crux.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-top-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-top--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-top--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-top--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-top--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-top--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-top-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve had little time on the Getaway XPs, but I am fairly stoked from my time on them. The ride feels like a tubular tire with a muted yet supple quality. The open tubular feel differs from the gravel-style tires I’ve ridden over the past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-in-bike-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-in-bike--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire in bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-in-bike--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-in-bike--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-in-bike--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-in-bike--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-in-bike-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the open road, the Getaway is a fast tire; the tightly spaced center line keeps a fast roll, and the overall tread is minimal. The knobs offer a round tire with predictable corning on the road, compared to some “flat top” style gravel treads that are all or nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-folded.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-folded-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire tread folded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-folded-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-folded-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-folded-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-folded-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-tread-folded.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The volume was a bit much for me on my initial road-ish rides, but the Getaway hit its stride when I hit the gravel and dirt. The volume aids in traction and comfort, notably. The open tubular casing is very active and sensitive to bumps and terrain. The thickness of the XP casing takes away a bit of the suppleness (compared to the original Getaway casing), but it’s hardly noticeable with 45mm of the tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-knobs-side-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-knobs-side--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Getaway XP Gravel Tire knobs side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-knobs-side--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-knobs-side--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-knobs-side--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-knobs-side--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Challenge-Getaway-XP-Gravel-Tire-knobs-side-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t 100% speak to the puncture protectiveness of the Getaway XP tire and new Corazza Armor. Though I have ridden this tire in some sketchy places, the sidewalls are still very much intact, and I’ve yet to flat.
