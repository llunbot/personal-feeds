For iPhone 15 Pro owners, this is a must-download. As we previously explained, some users have been experiencing <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2083659/iphone-15-pro-overheating-thermal-system-design-software-update.html\">overheating</a> during certain tasks, which Apple has chalked up to some bad app updates as well as a bug in iOS 17, which has been fixed with this update. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s release notes for iOS 17.0.3 say:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update provides important bug fixes, security updates, and addresses an issue that may cause iPhone to run warmer than expected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you have an iPhone 15 Pro, grab this update now and make sure your apps are up to date. (Uber and Instagram are notable popular apps that seem to be contributing to the overheating issue and have been recently updated.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even if you don’t have the latest iPhone, iOS 17.0.3 is a worthwhile download.

These fixes will also be part of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2084154/ios-17-1-beta-1-has-just-been-released-to-developers.html\">iOS 17.1</a>, which is currently in testing and will likely be released later this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Kernel</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact: </strong>A local attacker may be able to elevate their privileges.
