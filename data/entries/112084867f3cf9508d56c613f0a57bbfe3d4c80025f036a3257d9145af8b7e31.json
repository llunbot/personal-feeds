However, sometimes you want to let people know that you’re unavailable while driving. Apple offers an auto-reply to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to make sure that the While Driving mode of Focus turns on automatically while you’re driving. Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Focus</em> &gt; <em>Driving Focus </em>&gt; <em>While Driving</em> to set options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Activate:</strong> The Automatically option should be set by default. However, you might prefer to use <em>When Connected to Car Bluetooth</em> if you’re never driving without connecting—that is, other times, you’re on transit or a passenger. You can also set <em>Manually</em> to enable from Control Center—before driving, not while!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Activate With CarPlay:</strong> If you’re one of the many people with an automobile that has CarPlay installed, enable this switch so that While Driving is synced with your use of CarPlay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mac911-driving-focus-sbs.png?w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 16 Messages driving focus\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mac911-driving-focus-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2422w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mac911-driving-focus-sbs.png?resize=300%2C181&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mac911-driving-focus-sbs.png?resize=768%2C464&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mac911-driving-focus-sbs.png?resize=1200%2C725&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mac911-driving-focus-sbs.png?resize=1536%2C928&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mac911-driving-focus-sbs.png?resize=2048%2C1238&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"725\" /><figcaption><p>First make sure While Driving engages automatically (left); then confirm who gets your auto-reply message.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Having now ensured While Driving will activate…while you’re driving, you can now set up responses. In <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Focus</em> &gt;<em> Driving Focus</em> &gt; <em>Auto-Reply,</em> you can compose a message; there’s one there by default: “I’m driving with Focus turned on. I’ll see your message when I get where I’m going.” You can choose whether it’s sent to No One (more like temporarily turning off the feature), Recents, Favorites, or All Contacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an especially dire situation, someone responding can send an additional message reading just “urgent” as a reply to override your Focus state. I would hope no one would do that without good reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
