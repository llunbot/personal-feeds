It also includes exclusive rights to the Tour de France Femmes in Ireland and Norway, plus exclusive rights to the men’s and women’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> in Norway and the Netherlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Discovery and co. are understandably delighted with this development, it comes at the cost of ITV’s Tour de France coverage – and free-to-air coverage of the Tour entirely in the UK (free-to-air coverage will continue in Europe).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stalwart of the ITV show Matt Rendell took to Twitter to respond to the news:</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>I guess you’ll have heard the news, that 2025 is to be ITV’s last Tour de France. Surprised (no free-to-air for London 2027??). Slightly in shock. No Gary presenting the Tour. Hard to believe.</p>— Matt Rendell @mattrendell@indieweb.social (@mrendell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrendell/status/1849783092698906643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rendell also added that it’s not just the live show, it looks to be the end for the nightly highlights programme too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While ITV has yet to comment on the matter, GCN’s Dan Lloyd has reported that ITV did not even bid for the rights:</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>I understand that ITV did not bid for the live rights, and nor did any other UK free-to-view broadcasters.<br /><br />Also sounds like WBD will make a big effort to ensure long form highlights will be available, free to view, somewhere. <a href=\"https://t.co/1q6BaB7Ifo\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/1q6BaB7Ifo</a></p>— Daniel Lloyd (@daniellloyd1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daniellloyd1/status/1849802802966466621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>This page will be updated with more details and fallout if/when it comes through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll always have the theme tune…</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best women’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vs-merckx\">Pogačar vs Merckx: Who had the best season ever?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ned-boulting-podcast-2024\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 115: Ned Boulting on the 2011 Tour de France, and other stories</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/itv-tour-de-france-2025\">ITV to lose Tour de France broadcast rights after 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8f7686b39b21f1e564bfcc5e95c3ee49cbf451019d03bd4ebc7934cdffd5c320","category":"Cycling"}
