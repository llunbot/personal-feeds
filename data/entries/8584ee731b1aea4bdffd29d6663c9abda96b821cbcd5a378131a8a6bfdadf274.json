Normally, these reports are kept confidential, leaving questions regarding the methods and extent of data manipulations.</p>\n<p>But in this case, the report became public because the researcher had filed a lawsuit that alleged defamation on the part of the team of data detectives that had first identified potential cases of fabricated data, as well as Harvard Business School itself. Now, the court has ruled on motions to dismiss the case. While the suit against Harvard will go on, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.259933/gov.uscourts.mad.259933.74.0.pdf\">the court has ruled</a> that evidence-backed conclusions regarding fabricated data cannot constitute defamationâ€”which is probably a very good thing for science.</p>\n<h2>Data and defamation</h2>\n<p>The researchers who had been sued, Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson, and Joe Simmons, run a blog called <a href=\"https://datacolada.org/\">Data Colada</a> where, among other things, they note cases of suspicious-looking data in the behavioral sciences. As we detailed in our earlier coverage, they published a series of blog posts describing an apparent case of fabricated data in four different papers published by the high-profile researcher Francesca Gino, a professor at Harvard Business School.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049567#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049567&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8584ee731b1aea4bdffd29d6663c9abda96b821cbcd5a378131a8a6bfdadf274","category":"Tech"}
