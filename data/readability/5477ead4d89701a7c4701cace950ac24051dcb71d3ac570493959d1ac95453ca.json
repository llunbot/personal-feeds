How can Muc-Off possibly know that Ludicrous AF is the World’s Fastest Race Lube? After all, there must be more drivetrain lubricants out there than there are stars in the sky. OK, maybe not that many, but you get the point. The answer is that, after investing a 7 figure sum in their in-house R&amp;D facilities, and bench marking their product against competitors’ lubes, Muc-Off are pretty confident in their claim.</p><h2>Muc-Off Ludicrous AF</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest.jpg\" alt=\"muc-off ludicrous af chain lube application\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031842/muc-off-ludicrous-af-bike-chain-lube-worlds-fastest-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Muc-Off Ludicrous AF is a pure, stripped-back race lube. It’s not an eye-catching neon presentation of their favorite color of the rainbow, nor does it smell like your morning coffee. It also doesn’t contain additional corrosion inhibitors, claiming the sustainability accolade, too. <em>“Just a unique blend of environmentally friendly raw ingredients designed to minimize chain friction and wear”</em> – Muc-Off. It is non-toxic and readily biodegradable, lacking PTFE and other environmentally harmful ingredients.&nbsp;</p><p>About that 7 figure investment…</p><p>Muc-Off now have a very expensive R&amp;D facility set up at their HQ in Poole, Dorset. It is home to state-of-the-art machinery, chief among which is a tribometer. A what now? It’s basically a machine used to perform tests and simulations of wear, friction and lubrication. Muc-Off say that it replicates friction-inducing motion in a way that is infinitely controllable. The metal-to-metal wear that happens on a bicycle drivetrain can be reproduced exactly, to keep conditions consistent while testing hundreds of different formulas.</p><p>So what other lubes has it been tested against?

That again showed that Ludicrous AF came out on top. But, it depends what time frame you’re looking at. Over the first 30 minutes of testing, AbsoluteBlack’s lube demonstrated the least loss of power, whereas Ludicrous AF demonstrated the most. As time went on however, AbsoluteBlack’s performance deteriorated while Ludicrous AF’s performance improved, actually demonstrating less chain power loss at 2 hours than it did at the beginning of the test.</p><p>How is that possible?</p><p>Another piece of kit Muc-Off have is a contour white light interferometer. This is said to allow the team to study how the lube beds-in to the chain on a molecular level. When applied to a chain, Muc-Off say it penetrates chain link scars to create a sheer plane. The PR mentions all sorts including the “charging up” of molecules, something we’re not sure we quite understand, but they do go on to say that the list of proprietary additives include synthetic polymers designed for long-distance performance.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube.jpg\" alt=\"muc-off ludicrous af chain lube worlds fastest durable sustainable\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16031839/muc-off-ludicrous-af-application-chain-lube-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Ultimately, the formula is said to reduce wear on chain components, making it super-fast and super-durable. Muc-Off say it provides unbeatable performance in both wet and damp or dry and dusty conditions at a range of temperatures.</p><p>Beyond the ultra-clean environment of the R&amp;D test facility, Ludicrous AF has been tested extensively out on the road.
