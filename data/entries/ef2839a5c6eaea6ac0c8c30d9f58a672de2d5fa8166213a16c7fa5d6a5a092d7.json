But based on a new paper by the University of Texas at Austin's Adrian Ward, this is just a variation on something that has been happening throughout human history. No person could ever learn everything they need to know. But that's OK, according to Ward: \"No one person needs to know everythingâ€”they simply need to know who knows it.\"</p>\n<p>Over time, we've developed alternatives to finding the person who has the information we need, relying on things like books and other publications. The Internet simply provides electronic equivalents, right?</p>\n<p>Not entirely, according to Ward's latest results. Based on data he generated, it seems that search engines now return information so quickly and seamlessly that we tend to think we remembered information that we actually looked up. And that may be giving us unjustified confidence in our ability to pull facts out of our brain.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806093#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806093&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ef2839a5c6eaea6ac0c8c30d9f58a672de2d5fa8166213a16c7fa5d6a5a092d7","category":"Tech"}
