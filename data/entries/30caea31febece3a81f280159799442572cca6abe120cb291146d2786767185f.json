Elon Musk again overwhelmingly topped the list with compensation amounting to $6.658 billion.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast month, it was alleged that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-wanting-to-become-apple-ceo/\">Musk demanded to become the CEO of Apple</a> as part of early discussions around a potential <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/22/elon-musk-tim-cook-tesla-meeting/\">Apple acquisition of Tesla</a>, though Musk denies this.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's Senior Vice President of Retail and People Deirdre O'Brien and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kate Adams also made the list in 93rd and 96th place, with pay of $45 million each. This makes O'Brien and Adams the fourth and fifth-highest paid women executives in the United States.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/04/tim-cook-now-the-eighth-highest-paid-executive/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Now the Eighth Highest-Paid Executive in the U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-now-the-eighth-highest-paid-executive-in-the-u-s.2306492/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oQAJ-ONwrFw:b7fvEuSE1QQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oQAJ-ONwrFw:b7fvEuSE1QQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oQAJ-ONwrFw\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"30caea31febece3a81f280159799442572cca6abe120cb291146d2786767185f","category":"Apple"}
