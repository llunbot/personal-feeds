Multi is a new utility for MacOS that makes any app multiplayer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shared control for any app or display</li>\n<li>Drawing and deep links for faster communication</li>\n<li>Native app crafted to feel like a part of MacOS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since launching a month ago Multi has seen an amazing response, in particular from the iOS/MacOS/Apple and Typescript communities — no surprise, given that Multi was built to help software teams build faster together.</p>\n\n<p>It’s rather amazing: “multiplayer MacOS” is a perfect description. The team behind it would love to hear what you think, and as part of their sponsorship, Daring Fireball readers <a href=\"https://multi.app/newsletter?r_id=DARINGFIREBALL\">get immediate access</a>. Every single person reading this should check it out. It’s that cool.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/24/multi\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e4143a6c707b5b310f517c2a65a95370542f704f818fdcb8c4d6c79a5dea7dc4","category":"Tech"}
