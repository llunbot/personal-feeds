Join us as experts from the community share how they use HashiCorp tools to codify their infrastructure, secure their data, and deploy their applications both on-premises and to the cloud.</p>\n\n<h2>What is HashiTalks?</h2>\n\n<p>HashiTalks is an annual HashiCorp User Group (HUG) virtual event that follows the sun around the world. It is produced and facilitated by the HashiCorp Community team. We hosted our first HashiTalks in February 2019 as a 24-hour event and since then we have watched community engagement in the event grow across the globe. Attending HashiTalks is an excellent way to engage with our community, learning from international speakers presenting in their local time zones. Viewers have the opportunity to engage live in chat and interact with key community leaders who participate as emcees throughout the event.</p>\n\n<p>The 24-hour HashiTalks event will be held in English with the support of American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters. We also hold several regional events throughout the year in local languages. In 2024, we produced HashiTalks in 8 geographic regions and 7 languages (you can watch those livestreams on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@HashiCorp/streams\">Live section of our YouTube channel</a>). In addition to our annual 24-hour event and the regional events, we also produced themed events specifically for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bswxyJvNDrQ\">builders within our ecosystem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL81sUbsFNc5Ye64ues9AEBu0kFv5TjSVb\">security engineers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Submit to the call for proposals</h2>\n\n<p>The HashiTalks <a href=\"https://www.sessionize.com/hashitalks-2025\">call for proposals</a> (CFP) is open to the community.

HashiTalks are intended to be a safe space, and HashiCorp’s <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines\">community guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/our-principles/\">principles</a> help ensure that all participants are welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone who makes an effort to submit to the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/sessionize.com/hashitalks-2024\">HashiTalks CFP</a> is encouraged to use the pre-recorded series of speaker-enablement sessions with industry leader and <a href=\"https://qconsf.com/\">QCon conference</a> chair <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesreisz\">Wesley Reisz</a> as a resource to develop your talk. We aim to consistently empower anyone who has expressed interest in giving talks by providing opportunities to learn and improve their skills.</p>\n\n<p>Talks given at HashiTalks will be recorded and posted as individual videos within a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL81sUbsFNc5Y657HkipxDVaGwXKHuPJY-\">YouTube playlist</a> for self-paced, on-demand viewing and to act as a point of reference for use cases from the community.</p>\n\n<p>Attendees are encouraged to ask questions in real time using YouTube’s chat feature while talks are in progress. Speakers are encouraged to hang out after their talks to answer questions, gather feedback, and interact.</p>\n\n<h3>Join us in February 2025</h3>\n\n<p>Register for <a href=\"http://hashi.co/hashitalks-2024\">HashiTalks</a> to stay up to date on the schedule of speakers and be eligible to win giveaways as we approach the day of the livestream.
