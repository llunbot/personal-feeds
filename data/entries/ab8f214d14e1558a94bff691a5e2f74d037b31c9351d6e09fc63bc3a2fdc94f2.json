Well, Matt bought a single ticket and ended up winning the bike! Dillen was already coming to Matt’s house to stay for the NM Bikepacking Summit, so he hand-delivered the bike. After a quick ride, Matt decided he’d take the bike on the Dangerbird. That’s serendipity at its finest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/The-2021-Dangerbird-57.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/The-2021-Dangerbird-70.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks to Baphomet Bicycles and Ride Group for pulling this together.
