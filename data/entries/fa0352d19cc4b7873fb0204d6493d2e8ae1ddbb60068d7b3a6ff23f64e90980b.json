That’s right, the cubist designs of Dutch artist Piet Mondrian are back in the professional peloton and will be gracing the acclaimed stones of Roubaix almost four decades on.</p>\n<p>The one-off kit, designed in collaboration with bicycle and component brand Look and clothing manufacturer Marcello Bergamo, will be worn in homage to the 1985 La Vie Claire team – which saw <em>le blaireau</em> Bernard Hinault win both the Giro d’Italia and Tour France – and Look launch its ‘groundbreaking’ clipless road pedals.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/09/look_history_1985_lemond-hinault_3.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The specially designed kit will be worn only once, at Paris-Roubaix, before presumably being whisked off the shoulders of the Team Delko riders and filled into Look’s historical vaults.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/1015/paris-roubaix-all-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix 2021: Route, start list and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/4470/where-paris-roubaix-2021-will-be-decided-part-4-roubaix-velodrome\">Where Paris-Roubaix 2021 will be decided, part 4: Roubaix Velodrome</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10138/paris-roubaix-weather\">Will it rain at Paris-Roubaix 2021?</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nLike the La Vie Claire kit of the 1980s, it uses red, yellow and blue blocks of colour bordered by black outlines coupled with plain black bibshorts that are finished with white panelling on either leg, just how Bernard Tapie intended.</p>\n<p>On the collaboration, Look Cycles CEO Federico Musi said, ‘We are very proud of our strong racing heritage at Look and the achievements of French riders and teams that we have been able to work with over the years. It’s a special moment for us to see the 1985 design ride again with Team Delko.</p>\n<p>‘We have been a partner of the team since they started amateur racing and have watched as they moved from strength to strength. From all of the Look family, we wish them the best of luck for Paris-Roubaix.’</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/09/look1985_delko_marseillecemmanuel_bournot_111.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The million dollar question for us connoisseurs of cycling’s past is, obviously, can we be dealt in on this kit too? The answer is yes, absolutely, but only if you are quick.</p>\n<p>Look and Team Delko are releasing this special kit as a limited edition run and, better yet, it is not even that expensive at €89 for the jersey and €99 for the bibshorts. Cheap as chips as far as <em>Cyclist</em> is concerned.</p>\n<p>The only issue is that there will only be 50 sets <a href=\"https://www.lookcycle.com/fr-fr/\">released on the Look website</a>, limited to customers in Europe (yes, that includes the UK…) and once they are gone, they are gone. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fa0352d19cc4b7873fb0204d6493d2e8ae1ddbb60068d7b3a6ff23f64e90980b","category":"Cycling"}
