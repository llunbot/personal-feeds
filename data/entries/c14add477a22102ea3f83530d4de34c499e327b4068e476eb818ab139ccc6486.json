Keep reading to learn how it's done.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg\" width=\"836\" height=\"470\" />\r<br />\nOn iPhone and iPad, Live Photos bring your pictures to life by adding a few seconds of video before and after the shot, creating a living memory rather than a static image. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Live Photos are great on their own, it's also possible to weave several together to create a video montage. This process transforms a collection of moments into a cohesive narrative, and offers an easier way to share and relive your memories. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhether it's a series of shots from a special event, a day out with friends, or a compilation of everyday moments, the following steps show you how to turn several Live Photos into a video that can encapsulate their essence in a way that a single photo or traditional video might not.\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n  <li>In the Photos app, tap the <strong>Albums</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Scroll down to \"Media Types,\" and tap <strong>Live Photos</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap <strong>Select</strong> in the top-right corner, then tap the Live Photos you want to include in your video so that a little checkmark appears on each one.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap the circle icon containing three dots in the bottom-right corner.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Choose <strong>Save as Video</strong> in the pop-up menu.</li>\r<br />\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/turn-live-photos-into-video.jpg\" alt=\"photos\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat's all there is to it.
