Corroborating previous rumors, the publication claims that the foldable is set to be a \"larger device\" rather than an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, instead embodying a tablet or notebook. Design efforts on the device are now said to be converging ahead of plans for mass production.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince hinge mechanisms for foldable devices have become increasingly advanced in recent years, the main problem for Apple's foldable is said to be developing a panel that meets its quality demands. The report adds that Apple's rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/foldable-iphone-paused-failing-screens/\">suspension of Samsung foldable display panel development</a> and internal reorganization to move Vision Pro engineers to the foldable project are not contradictory moves, since the company is overwhelmingly prioritizing quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report clarified that Apple has not suspended work on foldable devices, with the company allegedly now possessing multiple departments responsible for different foldable product lines. Apple's first foldable device will not launch until 2025 at the earliest.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/\">Foldable MacBook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/first-apple-foldable-wont-be-an-iphone/\">Apple's First Foldable Device Won't Be an iPhone, Say Supply Chain Sources</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-foldable-device-wont-be-an-iphone-say-supply-chain-sources.2420149/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e99e7cfb30c631189cc2fcd7a7391039ce106198c1af91da4b788af2231262e0","category":"Apple"}
