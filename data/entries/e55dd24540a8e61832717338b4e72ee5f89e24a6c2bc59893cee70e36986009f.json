However, based on previous reporting, he does not expect the Mac mini to be one of the first models with the M3 chip. They are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/\">likely to be</a> the 13-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch MacBook Air, and 24-inch iMac. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/\">last month said</a> that he did not expect a new Mac mini to emerge until late 2024 at the earliest. If the developer logs do indicate Apple is testing an M3 Mac mini, that could mean we could see it sooner than previously expected. That said, the latest Mac mini models are less than a year old, having been introduced in January 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌M3‌ chip is widely expected to be fabricated using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/3nm-macbook-pro-reportedly-launching-in-2023/\">TSMC's 3nm process</a> for significant performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the 5nm-based ‌M2‌ chip in existing devices.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-testing-mac-mini-m3/\">Apple May Be Testing an M3 Mac Mini, Based on Developer Logs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-may-be-testing-an-m3-mac-mini-based-on-developer-logs.2397965/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e55dd24540a8e61832717338b4e72ee5f89e24a6c2bc59893cee70e36986009f","category":"Apple"}
