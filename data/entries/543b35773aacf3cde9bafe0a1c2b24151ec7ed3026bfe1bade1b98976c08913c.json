Very sensibly you’ve kept your hands down, although you can actually take them off your handlebars whenever you like if you’re riding indoors while enjoying all the other benefits – beyond being warm, dry and safe – that BKOOL has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is BKOOL?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BKOOL is a virtual cycling simulator that stands out for its realism and breadth. It is the only indoor cycling app that offers four different types of riding content: real roads and tracks, velodrome, spinning classes and workouts, all of it customisable so you can plot your own training path rather than follow the hordes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That isn’t to say you’re alone. BKOOL brings together a community of thousands of cyclists in more than 150 countries around the world, so there will always be others on hand to ride or share tips with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about kit?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can enjoy BKOOL content on your computer (PC or Mac), tablet (Android or iPad) or smartphone (Android). All you need is a BKOOL Premium subscription, priced at €11 per month or €110 per year, plus a smart trainer or smart bike. That makes it among the best-value training apps, and you can try it free for 30 days at bkool.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BKOOL is designed to provide an immersive and realistic training experience. Your smart trainer or smart bike will simulate every incline, so you can experience legendary passes such as Alpe d’Huez or the Col du Tourmalet without leaving home. BKOOL even adds in details such as the slipstream when you slot in behind another rider and the force of the wind when you’re on your own.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-2-970x546.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-2-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-2-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-2-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And it’s simple – your smart trainer or smart bike connects to the BKOOL app via Bluetooth or ANT+, and you can connect to your favourite cycling apps such as Strava, Garmin Connect and TrainingPeaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is BKOOL the most complete?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes BKOOL so complete? Four reasons, the first of which is the largest collection of virtual cycling routes in the world. You can ride big mountain passes, classic road routes, gravel roads and mountain bike trails from all over the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can upload your virtual routes in video and 3D and add them to the BKOOL community. And with the Video Route Editor, you can turn your weekend rides into virtual routes and share them. All you need is a GPX file and the route video. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about workouts?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BKOOL has you covered here too, with the largest catalogue of structured cycling workouts available on any virtual training platform. There are hundreds of options with different durations, targets and intensities to help you get fitter on the bike, or you can create your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once signed up, you can find out your power zones with an FTP test, and BKOOL will automatically adjust the resistance of your trainer for each workout. As well as allowing you to create your own workouts, BKOOL lets you import workouts from other applications such as Training Peaks, which you can personalise by creating custom sessions. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>And there’s spinning too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BKOOL Spin Studio gives you the same workout as you get at the gym without leaving home. There are hundreds of instructor-led Video Spinning classes at different levels and durations, and in a selection of languages. BKOOL Spin Studio is a standalone app that you can use as part of your BKOOL Premium subscription. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-3-970x546.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-3-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-3-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-3-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/bkool-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Did someone say ‘velodrome’?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, BKOOL is the only virtual cycling app that includes three different velodromes, including London’s Lee Valley VeloPark. As well as racing, they can be used for warm-ups, warm-downs and training – and there are always other riders to share the experience. You can even test your fitness by taking on the Hour record and kilometre test, then set training goals to improve your times. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The community aspect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BKOOL also allows you to take part in events to experience the thrill of real-life races, all delivered using the same immersive mix of HD video and 3D elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BKOOL is the official host of the virtual Milan-San Remo, Strade Bianche, Tirreno-Adriatico, Il Lombardia, Deutschland Tour and the ultimate simulation experience: the Virtual Giro d’Italia, which thanks to exclusive and innovative technology allows you to enjoy videos of the real stages of recent editions of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride with the pros</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BKOOL’s ambassadors include Alberto Contador, Chris Froome, Óscar Freire, Team Polti Kometa and the Soudal-QuickStep team, including Spanish hero Mikel Landa and the current World Time-Trial and recently crowned double Olympic Champion Remco Evenepoel. You can ride with all of these huge names several times a year thanks to special Group Rides, as well as interact with them via Instagram Live. They’ll let you into their world – from the comfort of your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• Try BKOOL free for 30 days at <a href=\"https://www.bkool.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">bkool.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/be-fitter-be-faster-with-bkool\">Be fitter, be faster with BKOOL</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"543b35773aacf3cde9bafe0a1c2b24151ec7ed3026bfe1bade1b98976c08913c","category":"Cycling"}
