The smaller the transistors on a chip, the lower the energy consumption and the higher their speed. Today, terms such as “2 nanometer” and “3 nanometer” are widely used as shorthand for each new generation of chip, rather than a semiconductor’s actual physical dimensions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989946#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989946&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f10ef632c4d7d33e98838a711372a50bbabc9471f415b1344192579c257f4e9","category":"Tech"}
