{"title":"Germany Urges EU to Require 7 Years of Updates and Repairs for iOS Devices","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/06/germany-eu-require-7-years-iphone-updates/","date":1630926817000,"content":"Smartphone makers like Apple and Google should be required to provide security updates and spare parts for their mobile devices for at least seven years, according to new environmental responsibility proposals from the German government to the European Union (via <em><a href=\"https://www.heise.de/news/Bundesregierung-Smartphones-sollen-sieben-Jahre-lang-Updates-erhalten-6179995.html\">Heise Online</a></em>).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/apple-independent-repair-program.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe European Commission recently proposed that mobile device manufacturers should provide software updates and spare parts for five years, with tablet spare parts available for six years. It also wants to force manufacturers to publish the prices of the spare parts and ensure they don't increase, and deliver said parts in no more than five working days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Germany wants the EU to go further by demanding seven years of updates and spare parts availability. In addition, it wants manufacturers to offer spare parts at \"a reasonable price,\" and faster delivery of spare parts, a point it wishes to discuss further with the Commission.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe German government also supports the European Commission's push to introduce ecodesign rules, including an energy label and a repairability index for smartphones and tablets. The production of the equipment accounts for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EC, and only part of the raw materials can be recovered during recycling.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe DigitalEurope Industry Association, representing manufacturers including Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, believe the Commission's proposals go too far, and have suggested that makers provide security updates for three years and OS updates for two years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe association also believes that it should only be required to offer replacement batteries and displays to consumers, since these parts have the highest failure rate. In contrast, components like camera sensors, microphones, and connectors \"rarely fail,\" and therefore should not come under the mandate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing additional negotiations between all parties involved, the European Union plans to introduce the proposals by 2023.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has often been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/30/ifixit-apple-emails-right-to-repair/\">criticized</a> for disproportionate repair prices, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/11/homepod-mini-repair-fee/\">$79 fee</a> to service the $99 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, as well as arbitrary limits on repairs, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/30/iphone-12-camera-repairs-require-proprietary-tool/\">barring repair</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>'s camera without access to Apple's proprietary cloud-linked System Configuration app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe European Parliament last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/27/european-parliament-supports-right-to-repair/\">voted</a> to support the recommendations of the EU Committee on the \"Right to Repair,\" including a system of mandatory labelling on consumer electronics to provide explicit information on the repairability and lifespan of products.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/germany/\">Germany</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/\">Right to Repair</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/06/germany-eu-require-7-years-iphone-updates/\">Germany Urges EU to Require 7 Years of Updates and Repairs for iOS Devices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/germany-urges-eu-to-require-7-years-of-updates-and-repairs-for-ios-devices.2309854/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O9gLiLs0pl0:CV9fWgrq1iA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O9gLiLs0pl0:CV9fWgrq1iA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/O9gLiLs0pl0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4dfb3ea73a8a033da08f31c4feee97be9558fed4f601b7d80adb3336af83ea3","category":"Apple"}
