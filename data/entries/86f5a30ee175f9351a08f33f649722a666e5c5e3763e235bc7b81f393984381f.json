On this day, Chinese people prepare <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laba_congee\">Laba congee</a>, a special porridge combining various grains, dried fruits, and nuts. This</p> \n<p>nutritious mixture symbolizes harmony, prosperity, and good fortune — with each ingredient representing the diversity and abundance of life. This traditional practice dates back to when Buddha achieved enlightenment after consuming rice porridge, making it a symbol of both material and spiritual nourishment. The festival, occurring on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, marks the countdown to Spring Festival, China’s most significant traditional holiday celebrating family reunion and renewal.</p> \n<p>As our global tech community grows, such cultural celebrations remind us of the importance of inclusive innovation and shared progress.</p> \n<p><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></p> \n<p>Let’s take a look at what <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> launched in this week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-the-new-aws-asia-pacific-thailand-region/\">New AWS Asia Pacific (Thailand) Region</a>– AWS has expanded its global infrastructure with the launch of the new Asia Pacific (Thailand) <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region\">AWS Region</a>, featuring three Availability Zones.
