After getting no major new AI features in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/ios-18-3-release-date-beta-features-and-compatibility.html\">iOS 18.3</a>, Apple is bringing Apple Intelligence to many more countries in iOS 18.4 as well as a new device—Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the anticipated Siri update has to wait. There are several big Siri updates coming, including personal context, app intents, and screen reading, but they’re missing from iOS 18.4, and Apple is having <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2638224/report-apple-internally-acknowledges-ugly-and-embarrassing-siri-delays.html\">such trouble making it work well</a> that it’s not coming until next year. Despite missing this important feature—promised at WWDC last fall—there are lots of improvements in iOS 18.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS 18.4 beta began on February 21 with a developer beta, and the first public beta on February 24. The wide release came on March 31, just a little before the expected early April release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated March 31:</strong> iOS 18.4 is now in wide release. The release notes have been added below.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new in iOS 18.4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll update this section with the features and changes found in the latest iOS 18.4 beta, as they are found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Intelligence languages:</strong> Including Simplified Chinese, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish—along with localized English for Singapore and India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Intelligence regions:</strong> With iOS 18.4, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will gain access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Siri in Control Center:</strong> There are new Control Center options for Type to Siri and Talk to Siri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> You can now invoke Visual Intelligence on the Action button or from Control Center, and Visual Intelligence is available on iPhone 15 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Prioritize Notifications: </strong>Apple Intelligence will attempt to show notifications that may be important in a separate section on the lock screen.

There are a stunning 59 updates listed, which is more than we can recall seeing in any single release. Of course, that doesn’t make them more important, the severity of security vulnerabilities is not necessarily related to their number. But these fixes involve everything from under-the-hood core libraries and frameworks, kernel patches, all the way to common apps used every day like Calendar and Photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.4: How to install</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the latest version of iOS 18 on your phone, head over to the Settings app, then <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>. Then follow the prompts to restart and install the update. If you don’t want to wait until the official update arrives, you can install the most recent release candidate, which will be identical to the public release, by turning on <em>Beta Updates</em> in the Software Update tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18 superguide</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4f580532b705a6c1b560eddc35aac11333619abafc3ec62c69428f7b6d071a8a","category":"Apple"}
