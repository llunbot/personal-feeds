Google announced its cookie updates <a href=\"https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/\">in a blog post</a> shared today, where the company said that it instead plans to focus on user choice.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nRather than eliminating third-party cookies entirely, Google will introduce \"a new experience in Chrome\" that is designed to allow people to \"make an informed choice\" applicable across their web browsing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in 2020, Google claimed that it would phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022, a timeline that was pushed back multiple times due to complaints from advertisers and regulatory issues. Google has been working on a Privacy Sandbox to find ways to improve privacy while still delivering info to advertisers, but third-party cookies will now be sticking around so as not to impact publishers and advertisers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had opposed Google's plan to stop relying on third-party cookies because a shift to Privacy Sandbox could limit competition in digital advertising, and now the CMA says that it is <a href=\"https://x.com/CMAgovUK/status/1815465046689882274\">reviewing Google's new plan</a> for a user-choice prompt.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle does not plan to stop working on its Privacy Sandbox APIs, and the company says they will improve over time so that developers will have a privacy preserving alternative to cookies. Additional privacy controls, such as IP Protection, will be added to Chrome's Incognito mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of now, the new customer choices that Google is planning for are being discussed with regulators, with more information to come at a later date.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/google-keeping-third-party-cookies-chrome/\">Google No Longer Plans to Eliminate Third-Party Cookies in Chrome</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-no-longer-plans-to-eliminate-third-party-cookies-in-chrome.2431972/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e2be3f358e2d19253ea11d249e06a950254d399af00b087563f05aa714e30229","category":"Apple"}
