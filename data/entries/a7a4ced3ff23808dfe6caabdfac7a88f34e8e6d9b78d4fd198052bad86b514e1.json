This was surprising because she had died on a Canadian highway back in January.</p>\n<p>When Max last saw Betty White, his nickname for his Tesla Model Y Performance, they were both in rough shape after getting sideswiped on the highway. Max’s rotator cuff was torn in several places. The small SUV had bounced off multiple concrete barriers at high speed and was bashed in on all four corners, its wheels ripped to pieces. Coolant appeared to be leaking into the battery chamber. From his own work on EVs in the garage, Max knew that Betty was done for. “No auto shop would put a repair person at risk with that kind of damage,” says Max, whose last name isn’t being used out of doxing concerns.

His insurer agreed, and Betty was written off and sent to a salvage yard.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984930#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984930&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7a4ced3ff23808dfe6caabdfac7a88f34e8e6d9b78d4fd198052bad86b514e1","category":"Tech"}
