To date NASA and other space agencies have spent billions of dollars returning a few grams of rocky material from asteroids. Humanity has <em>never</em> visited a metal-rich asteroid, although that will finally change with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/10/nasa-is-about-to-launch-a-mission-of-pure-discovery-to-a-metal-asteroid/\">NASA's $1.4 billion Psyche mission</a> in 2029. And so commercial asteroid mining seems like a stretch, and indeed, other similarly minded startups have come and gone.</p>\n<p>But it turns out that I did hear from Acain and Gialich again about their asteroid mining venture, Astro Forge. On Tuesday the co-founders announced that they have successfully raised $40 million in Series A funding and shared plans for their next two missions. Astro Forge has now raised a total of $55 million to date.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044016#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044016&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1373d23e69c73d8cf34924e2d41cc5b2134e988742c8323966d43ac176e065e2","category":"Tech"}
