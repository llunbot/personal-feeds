Here's everything Double Tap can do, and how you can get it working on your watch today. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg\" alt width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nDouble Tap is a new gesture-based feature for the latest Apple Watch models that lets you control watch functions by tapping your thumb and index finger together twice. The feature aims to make it easier to navigate the Apple Watch when you have only one hand free, like when you're walking a dog, carrying groceries, or holding a cup of coffee.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Double Tap gesture is <strong>exclusive to the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2</strong>, and will be enabled with the release of watchOS 10.1 in October. watchOS 10.1 is currently available today as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/\">developer beta</a>. If you want to install the beta on your watch, it will need to be paired to an iPhone running the iOS 17.1 beta, which you can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-ios-17-beta-iphone/\">download for free</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>What Double Tap Can Do</h2>\r<br />\nDouble Tap's functionality is pretty simple. You raise your watch to wake, and then you double tap your thumb and index finger together to control what's happening on the screen of your watch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBy default, Double Tap selects the primary button in whatever app you're in. So for example, if you get a call, you can double tap to answer, and use it to hang up when you're done. Likewise, if you're watching/listening to media, you can pause it and resume it (or skip). \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome other use cases: If you've set a timer, double-tapping will pause it. Performing the gesture again will resume the countdown, and when the timer goes off, a double-tap will stop it. Similarly, you can use it to do other everyday things like snooze alarms, trigger the Camera Remote app's shutter button, and dismiss notifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-double-tap.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" /><div><em>Double Tap activation is indicated by a blue icon at the top of the screen</em></div>\r<br />\nAs you might expect, the gesture is also set up to assume your other hand is preoccupied. If you receive a text, for instance, a double tap lets you reply with a voice message, while another double tap sends the message.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, Double Tap can be used to invoke the Smart Stack from the watch face and advance through your widgets, offering you a one-handed glance of your most regularly viewed information. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>How to Set Up Double Tap</h2>\r<br />\nDouble Tap is disabled by default, so you will need to enable it manually for it to work. This can be done from your wrist or in the Watch app on iPhone, and both menus include options to customize Media Playback and Smart Stack functionality. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that to enable Double Tap, setup involves giving watchOS permission to disable some Accessibility options, including Assistive Touch, Zoom with Hand Gestures, VoiceOver with Hand Gestures, and Quick Actions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>On Apple Watch:</h3>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li>\r<br />\n<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> at the bottom of the on-screen alert.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Choose your preferred setting for \"Playback\" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and \"Smart Stack\" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap2.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1920\" height=\"940\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>On iPhone:</h3>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Watch</strong> app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>With the \"My Watch\" tab selected, tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li>\r<br />\n<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> in the on-screen alert.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Choose your preferred setting for \"Playback\" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and \"Smart Stack\" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap1.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says Double Tap is enabled by the S9 chip's faster Neural Engine, which is why the feature is only available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Apple said it developed an algorithm that detects the \"unique signature\" of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb are tapped together.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/\">How to Use Hand Gestures to Control Your Apple Watch</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nIf you own an earlier Apple Watch model that doesn't support Double Tap, you can always try a similar but more limited accessibility feature called <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/\">AssistiveTouch</a>, which is available on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/double-tap/\">Double Tap</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/new-apple-watch-double-tap-gesture/\">New Apple Watch Double Tap Feature: What It Does and How to Get It</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-watch-double-tap-feature-what-it-does-and-how-to-get-it.2406256/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d779c35389f21cbe2d7217dd5a3e7557cdb09c2b0111d054c710dcdbe953c8c5","category":"Apple"}
