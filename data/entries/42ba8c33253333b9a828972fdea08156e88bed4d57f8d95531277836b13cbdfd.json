In January 2023, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/cdc-and-fda-identify-preliminary-covid-19-vaccine-safety-signal-persons-aged-65-years-and-older\">jointly reported a preliminary safety signal</a> from their vaccine-monitoring systems that indicated mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may increase the risk of strokes in the 21 days after vaccination of people ages 65 and older. Since that initial report, that signal decreased, becoming statistically insignificant. Other vaccine monitoring systems, including international systems, have not picked up such a signal. Further studies (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2023-10-25-26/01-VaxSafety-Shimabukuro-508.pdf\">summarized here</a>) have not produced clear or consistent data pointing to a link to strokes.</p>\n<p>In May, the FDA concluded that the evidence does not support any safety concern and reported that \"scientists believe factors other than vaccination might have contributed to the initial finding.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995767#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995767&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"42ba8c33253333b9a828972fdea08156e88bed4d57f8d95531277836b13cbdfd","category":"Tech"}
