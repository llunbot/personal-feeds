As such, it looks like a great rear tire to pair with something a little grabbier on the front for mixed conditions, but at the moment their other fastest tires top out at 2.25″ and 2.3″. For now, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-tire-comparison.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"572\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-tire-comparison.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-tire-comparison.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-tire-comparison-297x170.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-tire-comparison-120x69.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-tire-comparison-768x439.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>L to R: Thunder Burt, Rick XC, and Racing Ralph.

Rectangular transition knobs with files between them lead to taller shoulder cornering knobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined, they say it “combines grip and low rolling resistance like no other Schwalbe XC tire”. It’s also E-25 e-bike rated, and comes in two versions and two sizes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>29 x 2.25 Super Race I Addix Speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>29 x 2.25 Super Ground I Addix Speedgrip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>29 x 2.40 Super Race I Addix Speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>29 x 2.40 Super Ground I Addix Speedgrip</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1530\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe rick xc mountain bike tire tread closeup.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-mountain-bike-tire-3-275x300.jpg 275w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-mountain-bike-tire-3-110x120.jpg 110w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/schwalbe-rick-xc-mountain-bike-tire-3-768x839.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tan-wall Addix Speed models have a higher durometer rubber that rolls faster but has slightly less grip. The black wall Addix Speedgrip models are a bit softer and gripper, but with slightly more rolling resistance. Weights are the same between them by size – 29×2.25″ are 680g, and 29×2.4″ are 760g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available now, MSRP €68.90 (about $90 USD).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.schwalbe.com/en/Rick-XC-11654568\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-rick-xc-is-that-new-in-between-race-tire/\">Schwalbe Rick XC is that new In-Between Race Tire</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c40d423ff6cb29a30220ad8772a0bc5c3f1469dacb9ecc2ef6feb50cca937631","category":"Cycling"}
