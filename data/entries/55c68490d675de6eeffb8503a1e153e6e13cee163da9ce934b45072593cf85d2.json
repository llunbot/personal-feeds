The technology allows for faster wireless charging (up to 15W on most models and 25W on newer Pro models) compared to standard Qi wireless charging, which is limited to 7.5W on iPhones.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-launches-feb-28-new-features/\">iPhone 16e Launches Today With These New Features</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple has developed a whole ecosystem of MagSafe accessories including cases, wallets, battery packs, and mounts. The magnetic alignment ensures an optimal charging position and makes attaching accessories more convenient.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the iPhone 16e was announced, there was some speculation that its new C1 modem might have interfered with MagSafe functionality, but Apple has already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-no-magsafe-unrelated-to-c1/\">confirmed</a> that this wasn't the case. Backing up Apple's claim, a prominent iPhone case manufacturer also told <em>MacRumors</em> that its testing confirmed that MagSafe cases don't impact the C1 modem's performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16e continues the trend set by its predecessor, the now-discontinued iPhone SE, which also lacked MagSafe connectivity. However, the 16e is the first iPhone in Apple's flagship smartphone lineup to omit this feature since its introduction. For users who prefer the convenience of MagSafe, some third-party iPhone 16e cases include built-in magnets, but they won't enable faster charging speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-16e-retail-charging-dock.jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1179\" height=\"884\" />\r<br />\nInterestingly, <em><a href=\"https://www.ithome.com/0/834/441.htm\">IT Home</a></em> reports that Apple retail stores have had to create a workaround for displaying the iPhone 16e with wireless charging that prevents the device from slipping off its display dock. Apple is using a special docking station that includes a bottom groove that holds the device upright, enabling wireless charging during demonstrations. This custom dock only activates charging when the phone is placed vertically â€“ if you place it horizontally, the iPhone falls off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's decision to exclude MagSafe from the iPhone 16e may be a cost-cutting measure. But as Gruber notes, \"I think Apple knows the 16e's intended audience better than I do,\" suggesting the company has done its market research on what features matter most to the target buyers of this device.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-accessories/\">MagSafe Accessories</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-provides-reason-iphone-16e-no-magsafe/\">Apple Provides Reason for iPhone 16e's Lack of MagSafe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-provides-reason-for-iphone-16es-lack-of-magsafe.2450353/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"55c68490d675de6eeffb8503a1e153e6e13cee163da9ce934b45072593cf85d2","category":"Apple"}
