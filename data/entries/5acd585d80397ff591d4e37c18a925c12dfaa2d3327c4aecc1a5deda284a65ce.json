But he's also chosen some truly original, visionary independent projects, most recently 2019's Lovecraft adaptation <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/color-out-of-space-review-nic-cage-lovecraft-match-made-in-rlyeh/\"><em>Color Out of Space</em></a> and the bloody horror comedy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy%27s_Wonderland\"><em>Willy's Wonderland</em></a> earlier this year. He's currently earning critical raves for his portrayal of a chef turned truffle hunter in search of his stolen truffle pig in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(2021_film)\"><em>Pig</em></a>. And now we have the official trailer for Cage's latest film, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_the_Ghostland\"><em>Prisoners of the Ghostland</em></a>, a post-apocalyptic thriller that looks like <em>Max Max</em> transported into a surreal samurai Western.</p>\n<p><em>Prisoners</em> is helmed by idiosyncratic auteur <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sion_Sono\">Sion Sono</a>. While Sono isn't a household name in the US, he has enjoyed a fair amount of fame in his native Japan and on the film festival circuit. The Hollywood Reporter <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sion-sono-film-review-915591/\">once called him</a> \"the most subversive director working in Japanese cinema today, with nearly 50 films of various genres—rite-of-passage stories fueled with social transgressions, all-out sex-and-gore thrillers, hip-hop musicals, and warm human drama.\" He's perhaps best known for 2008's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Exposure\"><em>Love Exposure</em></a>, a four-hour (!) art-house comedy drama inspired by Sono's <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2009/09/film/10-true-90-lies\">own youthful experience</a> with a cult.</p>\n<p><em>Prisoners of the Ghostland</em> is Sono's English-language debut, and it looks like a good fit for Cage's colorfully flamboyant, mega-acting style. (Cage himself has called his method \"Nouveau Shamanic\" or \"Western kabuki.\") The film premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival to decidedly mixed reviews, although both Cage's performance and Sono's striking visuals received praise.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786477#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786477&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5acd585d80397ff591d4e37c18a925c12dfaa2d3327c4aecc1a5deda284a65ce","category":"Tech"}
