Real-time website status tracker DownDetector received <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/massive-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-october-2021/\">over 14 million </a>reports from users who couldn't use the social media giant's apps and services.</p>\n<p>But beyond the obvious inconvenience to those cut off from these services, yesterday's outage has had financial repercussions not only for Facebook, but many small businesses that rely on the platform.</p>\n<h2>Downtime estimated to cost Facebook over $60 million</h2>\n<p>Facebook's 2020 revenue was $86 billion. Experts have used this number to approximate the average loss incurred by the company yesterday at <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-outage-by-the-numbers-largest-outage-ever-tracked-could-cost-millions-11633387093\" target=\"_blank\">$163,565 for every minute</a> of the outage. Over the six-hour period, this sums up to roughly $60 million in lost revenue. Another report by Fortune <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/10/04/facebook-outage-cost-revenue-instagram-whatsapp-not-working-stock/\" target=\"_blank\">pinned</a> the loss at $100 million, stating that \"for many companies, a $100 million drop in revenue over any time period would be a financial event of significant concern.
