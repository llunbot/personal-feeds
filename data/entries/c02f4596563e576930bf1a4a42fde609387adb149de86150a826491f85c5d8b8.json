Over more than 200 hours, I ate up the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-trailer-gives-us-more-elden-ring-lore-to-get-wrong/\">cryptic lore</a>, learned lots of timings, and came to appreciate the feeling of achievement through perseverance.</p>\n<p>Months ago, in preparation for <em>Elden Ring's</em> expansion, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/\"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> (also on <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA04610_00-ELDENRINGDLC0000\">PlayStation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k\">Xbox, </a>arriving June 21), I ditched the save file with which I had beaten the game and started over.

Reader, this expansion is mopping the floor with me. It looked at my resume, which has \"Elden Lord\" as its most recent job title, and has tossed it into the slush pile. If you're wondering whether <em>Shadow</em> would, like <em>Elden Ring</em>, provide <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/\">a different kind of challenge</a>Â and offer, like the base game, easier paths for <em>Souls</em> newcomers: No, not really.
