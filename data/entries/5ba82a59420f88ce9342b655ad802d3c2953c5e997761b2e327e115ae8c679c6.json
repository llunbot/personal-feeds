Essentially you got pro-level DH suspension, but with a Climb switch-activated platform so you could then efficiently pedal it back to the top of the mountain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That gives you independent adjustability to really fine-tune the feel of your bike’s suspension, perfectly tailoring it to offer the best balance of support and suppleness to expertly match the individual kinematic design of your bike. That stays the same, just now you get a new hydraulic bottom-out feature to ramp up support in the last 1/4 of your bikes travel and prevent a harsh bottom when you finally smash through all the travel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast also slimmed down the new shock by 6mm in width, then shifted the piggyback 3mm further from the mount. First by narrowing down the damper head, and then rotating the main body of the Fenix 2.0’s piggyback reservoir, to tuck it in closer to the coil to reduce overall size a bit, to fit more of today’s enduro and all-mountain bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fast-Suspension-Fenix-2-MTB-coil-shock_custom-tune-3-way-adjustable-enduro-mountain-bike-shock-update_LTD-Purple-Climb-switch-and-LSC-dial-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fast-Suspension-Fenix-2-MTB-coil-shock_custom-tune-3-way-adjustable-enduro-mountain-bike-shock-update_LTD-Purple-Climb-switch-and-LSC-dial-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Fast Suspension Fenix 2.0 high-performance enduro mountain bike coil shock, Climbn switch &amp;
