{"title":"Tuesday Telescope: Does this Milky Way image remind you of Powers of 10?","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-the-heart-of-the-galaxy-revealed-in-two-kinds-of-light/","date":1744110917000,"content":"<p>When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0\">Powers of 10 video</a>, which came out in the 1970s. Perhaps you remember it, with the narrator taking us both outward toward the fathomless end of the Universe and then, reversing course, guiding us back to Earth and inside a proton. The film gave a younger me a good sense of just how large the Universe around us really is.</p>\n<p>What I did not know until much later is that the short film was made by <a href=\"https://www.eamesoffice.com/about/biography/\">the Eames Office</a>, which was founded by the noted designers Charles Eames and Ray Kaiser. It's the same organization that produced the Eames Lounge Chair. It goes to show you the value of good design across genres (shoutout to Ars' resident designer, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/author/aurich-lawson/\">Aurich Lawson</a>).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I say all that because the Power of 10 film continues to live in my head, rent-free, decades later. It was the first thing I thought of when looking at today's image of the Milky Way Galaxy's center. The main image showcases huge vertical filaments, with the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core clearly visible. This image, captured by a South African radio telescope named MeerKAT, also shows the ghostly, bubble-like remnants of supernovas that exploded over millennia.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-the-heart-of-the-galaxy-revealed-in-two-kinds-of-light/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-the-heart-of-the-galaxy-revealed-in-two-kinds-of-light/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0983adf337c895ce15925bccb2108ad1d295e56e99eef112af997b1455ddd77a","category":"Tech"}
