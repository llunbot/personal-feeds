This is not a haven of high-end dream machines – these are functional, utilitarian bikes in need of a bit of love. So why are we here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes London Bike Kitchen special is not the bikes, but the people doing the repairs, and the ethos they bring to the job. This is not your average bike shop.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-integration\">Opinion: Bike integration has gone too far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-upgrades\">Best road bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-to-do-with-old-cycling-kit-bikes-parts\">Here’s what to do with all the bike stuff you don’t need</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 144: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Open for everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jenni Gwiazdowski has a Polish passport but was born and raised in California. In 2012 she founded LBK in the mould of open workshops she knew on the west coast of America – DIY spaces complete with second-hand parts, tools to use and mechanics ready to answer questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LBK has been on a mission to educate the public on how to repair, how to re-use and how to include those who haven’t necessarily been welcomed by the industry: namely, women and non-binary people of colour. Gwiazdowski explains that she aims to ‘teach people ways to get more life out of what they already have and how to buy better so that they don’t have to be a part of that hamster wheel of buying stuff all the time’. In this kitchen, they like you to do the cooking yourself.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-776x970.jpg\" alt=\"London Bike Kitchen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While it is a company, LBK has a not-for-profit structure. It operates as a worker co-op and only employs female or non-binary staff. As you might imagine, its cooperative status adds weight to the recruitment process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You need every single person to be on board,’ Gwiazdowski says. ‘Pretty much all decisions are communal. We have weekly meetings, agendas set up and we talk about the finances, marketing, the workshop, the classes – how are things going? How can we do stuff better?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This democratised utopia seems to be working well: during our visit the workshop is full of smiling faces and everyone is wrenching and hammering away happily at their stations. Gwiazdowski is adamant that ‘skills, sure, they can be taught. But… vibe check. Are we going to get on as human beings?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At LBK, anyone can come in and have a tube fixed or a chain changed, but education has always been at the centre of the project. They teach classes on everything from maintaining disc brakes and repairing punctures to changing a cassette and indexing gears. Which begs the question: if you teach all your customers how to fix their bikes, aren’t you doing yourself out of a job? That would be to miss the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our space has enabled people to get comfortable in workshop environments, which typically aren’t places people are invited into at an Evans or wherever, where it’s all done in the back. So by having that kind of open space, and saying, “We want you to come in, use the tools and ask questions,” people start to see something in themselves and they are like, “I really love doing this. I love working with my hands.”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no better testimonial to learning than Gwiazdowski herself, who went from knowing how to change a puncture and brake pads in 2010 to publishing her own book <em><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fhow-to-build-a-bike%2Fjenni-gwiazdowski%2F9780711238985\" target=\"_blank\">How To Build A Bike</a></em> in 2017. As the LBK motto goes: ‘Fix shit or cry trying’. (You can get it on a T-shirt.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting your hands dirty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>LBK’s ethos is a progressive move away from our habitual buy, break and dispose culture. It’s more than just a workshop. You can subscribe to its bike seat library to find the perfect perch, or sign up to its whimsical newsletter that’s stuffed with meme and gif-based tutorials, not to mention the excellent <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/wheel-suckers-podcast\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wheel Suckers</em> podcast</a>, which is well worth tapping into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back on the shop floor you won’t find any targets. Bikes and jobs are assessed on a case-by-case basis. As Gwiazdowski says, ‘We don’t have quotas. We don’t keep score about bikes getting done. They take the time they take. I’m a big believer in doing it right the first time.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"693\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-693x970.jpg\" alt=\"London Bike Kitchen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-693x970.jpg 693w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-214x300.jpg 214w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-360x504.jpg 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-750x1050.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02-1140x1596.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And just as many office workers are lapsing into daydream mode as 4pm rolls by, equally nothing new is getting pulled apart in LBK’s oily kitchen. The rule is that mechanics are not allowed to start any new jobs after that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You’re going to start making mistakes. Rushing doesn’t fix anything,’ says Gwiazdowski. ‘Do some cleaning instead.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Gwiazdowski did her City &amp; Guilds Cycle Mechanic training in 2011, she was the only woman on her course. While this wasn’t a huge stumbling block for her, she knew it was important to provide access for others, which is why LBK started hosting WAG – women and gender variant – nights, where people were invited to use the workshop for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The WAG nights were trying to encourage women to come in because LBK is open to all but that doesn’t mean everyone’s coming from the same place. Women are still not very well represented in STEM [science, technology, engineering, maths] fields, so to get women to even think they could do something like this you have to create a space specifically for them.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn’t just beneficial for those taking part, as it turned out. The WAG nights became a way of scouting for budding employees, and two current mechanics came from that route.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Gwiazdowski discovered that other Hackney bikeshops didn’t think they had a representation problem. ‘They said, “We’re fine, we’ve got women customers. Women just don’t want to be mechanics.” This industry is not welcoming – it’s very much a boy’s club. People just want to keep doing what they’re doing and, in some respects, I can understand that, but I don’t want to live in that kind of world.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led her to help form the Women of Colour Cycling Collective after seeing an article in <em><a href=\"https://gal-dem.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gal-dem</a></em> magazine about <a href=\"https://www.ridelondon.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">RideLondon</a> that centred on female participants of colour. ‘WCCC was just a social thing for people to meet up,’ she says. ‘The biggest thing we heard from people was that they felt lonely. They’re the only woman of colour in their cycling club or on the road that they see, so when they do see another person of colour, they think, “Let’s talk.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think there’s some comfort knowing that. And so for them to be able to find other women who are as crazy about it as they are, it just makes you feel better.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with most independent London businesses, there’s an air of uncertainty around LBK’s future. It even took some vigorous adjacent campaigning to save their premises during the past ten-year stay of execution. But things are looking bright, and from someone who claims they are ‘super-lazy when it comes to maintaining my own bikes’, it seems Gwiazdowski’s kitchen is going to be cooking with gas for a while yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kitchen crew</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jenni</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"London Bike Kitchen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you get into being a bike mechanic?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I grew up in San Diego and was cycling from an early age, but I had no real interest in bikes until I moved to Japan. After I moved to Oxford (initially thinking double yellow lines were the cycle lane) I took my first maintenance class. My instructor was a guy who I eventually hired at LBK as our wheelbuilding instructor. How the tables do turn!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the best things about the job?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With customers, the stock response is that they are clueless and they want someone else to do it for them, but once you nudge people in the right direction they often surprise themselves. Also, being able to create a working environment where all the staff are learning and growing together makes it worthwhile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the importance of having a women and non-binary-led workshop?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We live in a culture where everything is basically set up by cisgendered white men. You have to create smaller groups for under-represented people as these are the stepping stones for everyone to get comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hayley</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"London Bike Kitchen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you get into being a bike mechanic?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The push came about three years ago.

Not all workshops are all-male, but enough that people feel intimidated and are put off getting their bikes serviced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that we walk the walk and embody what we’re about: an anti-capitalist, queer, environmentally conscious bicycle workshop and classroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Amie</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"London Bike Kitchen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you get into being a bike mechanic?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started off by volunteering at my local bike shop just after lockdown, having bought a new bike. I joined Jenni’s online fix-a-longs and loved the atmosphere and her approach to learning. Shortly after the online course, by some miracle LBK was hiring, so I took the leap and left my job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the best things about the job?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many positives, but the anti-capitalist culture is a big one. There is no hierarchy and everyone treats people like people and not like machines. Plus we’re committed to debunking bicycle industry myths that only serve to encourage endless consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the importance of having a women and non-binary-led workshop?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A workshop with only women and non-binary people provides a very different dynamic. It’s nice to come to work in a space that’s safe from lots of the problems of patriarchy. It’s also refreshing for our customers and it really gives younger people a great example of what’s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Silvi</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"London Bike Kitchen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you get into being a bike mechanic?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From being a BMX athlete. I was constantly sorting something out on my BMX due to wear and tear and from crashes. Then I discovered the passion while working as a bike builder in a bike shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the best things about the job?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Positives: getting a non-working bike back to being fully functional again. So satisfying! And I love how open and empowering our team at LBK is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drawbacks: hair stuck on hubs, and dirty, dirty, dirty bikes. I don’t mind cleaning them – what I mind is that people don’t look after their own bikes enough. Those poor bikes tend to be in shocking states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the importance of having a women and non-binary-led workshop?</strong> Spaces like ours are still so few, and it emphasises how under-represented we are in this industry. LBK provides role models for people that have historically been put into gender-biased boxes. I can’t emphasise enough the difference it makes to see people doing things we once thought weren’t for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 144 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/london-bike-kitchen\">London Bike Kitchen: We’re here to fix things</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"30614995d211a43e1c460b111f318de809346fc297faeb87d70d67f63cecb73d","category":"Cycling"}
