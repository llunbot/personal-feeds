Just because a product is made in China or Vietnam or Thailand, doesn’t mean that everything made in that country is subject to a flat-rate tariff. As has always been the case, tariff charges are hyper-specific to certain product types, as classified by a massive index of product categories. Companies spend vast sums of time and effort to find the most optimal classification for their product.</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, most of the new US tariffs are sweeping (with few exceptions), and Wahoo (like all companies selling into the US) has gotten caught up in that storm. <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/05/wahoo-fitness-adds-tariff-surcharge-to-trackr-radar.html\">As you may remember from a month ago</a>, Wahoo tried to add a tariff surcharge for US purchasers for their new TRACKR Radar, only to have that smacked down by e-commerce giants. So instead, they added a shipping surcharge, but that only complicated things for retailers (and was misleading to consumers). Finally, the company has decided that simply raising prices is the most logical way forward.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of all the price increases. Initially, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/gplama\">GPLAMA</a> had noticed the price increases on the three bike computers + treadmill, and then I decided to continue down that rabbit hole over my morning coffee.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>TRACKR HR:</strong> $89 to $99<br />\n<strong>TRACKR RADAR:</strong> $199 to $249<br />\n<strong>BOLT 3:</strong> $329 to $349<br />\n<strong>ROAM 3:</strong> $449 to $464<br />\n<strong>ACE:</strong> $599 to $624<br />\n<strong>DESK:</strong> $199 to $229<br />\n<strong>HEADWIND:</strong> $299 to $319<br />\n<strong>KICKR CORE (+Zwift COG Variant):</strong> $499 to $534<br />\n<strong>KICKR ROLLR:</strong> $599 to $699<br />\n<strong>KICKR CLIMB:</strong> $699 to $749<br />\n<strong>KICKR V6:</strong> $999 to $1,049<br />\n<strong>KICKR MOVE:</strong> $1,299 to 1,349<br />\n<strong>KICKR BIKE SHIFT:</strong> $2,499 to $2,549<br />\n<strong>KICKR BIKE V2:</strong> $3,799 to $3,899<br />\n<strong>KICKR RUN (Treadmill):</strong> $4,999 to $6,999</p></blockquote>\n<p>Notably, Wahoo’s US site still seems to be updating itself, because if you hover over products, you’ll see the old price. But once you open up the product page, you’ll see the new price. Also notably, Amazon’s pricing on many of these, like the new <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4kx0GKk\">ROAM 3</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/43VkQqu\">BOLT 3</a>, appear to still be older. Undoubtedly it’ll take time for retailers to update pricing too.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I do appreciate that Wahoo isn’t punishing European (or any other region) users for the US’s play-time. European pricing has remained as-is, insofar as I can tell. This is notable, as sports tech companies have been taking various approaches here. In the case of Suunto, Polar, and now Wahoo, they’re letting the US absorb those tariff price impacts by themselves. Or, in the case of Polar, not even launching the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/06/polar-grit-x2-in-depth-review.html\">Polar Grit X2 yesterday</a>, to the US for now.</p>\n<p>Whereas some companies are instead raising prices across the board, seemingly to either soften the impact of the tariff on US customers, or to just be more profitable. We’ve seen Garmin keep so-called price parity between the US and EU on recent launches, meaning the price is both $749 &amp; 749EUR. It’s a practice many companies have tended to do in the past, but now is more difficult to do with the tariffs depending on the country of origin. Of course, there’s also the reality that, for some products, Garmin is just raising prices because they can. On their earnings call, they alluded to the massive cash reserve they have, and having a bit more flexibility to absorb some of the tariffs without having to increase all prices. Said differently, it can swing both ways (keeping costs lower, or raising them).</p>\n<p>Garmin’s CEO said during <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/garmin-q1-2025-earnings-call-tariffs\">the most recent earnings call that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“So we’re evaluating pricing not broadly, but specifically in context of each market and product line… there are cases where definitely, there’s room to have different pricing, and there’s other cases because… it’s more competitive and difficult to increase prices.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the end of the day, there’s no good answer here. But of course, we already knew that months ago.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you wanted any of the above products near-term, I’d be buying them today-ish, before retailers get wind of the price adjustments and increase their platforms.</p>\n<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"0942b788f482bad8944074b192e8fcd74ca0f531956ffabb09a91b11413e471c","category":"Cycling"}
