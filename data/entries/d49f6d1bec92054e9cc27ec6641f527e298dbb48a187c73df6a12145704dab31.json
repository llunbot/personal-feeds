Can an artificially intelligent robot create a true moral compass for itself? Is there a best time to play <em>The Talos Principle</em> again?</p>\n<p>The answer to at least one of these questions is now somewhat answered. <em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened,</em> due in \"Early 2025,\" will bundle the original critically acclaimed 2014 game, its <em>Road to Gehenna </em>DLC, and a new chapter, \"In the Beginning,\" into an effectively definitive edition. Developer commentary and a level editor will also be packed in. But most of all, the whole game has been rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, bringing \"vastly improved visuals\" and quality-of-life boosts to the game, according to publisher Devolver Digital.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Trailer for <em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em>.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Playing <em>Reawakened, </em><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2806640/The_Talos_Principle_Reawakened/\">according to its Steam page</a> requires a minimum of 8 GB of RAM, 75 GB of storage space, and something more than an Intel integrated GPU.
