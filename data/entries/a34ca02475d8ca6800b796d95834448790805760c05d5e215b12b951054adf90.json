As of April 30th 2025, developers were finally\nallowed to send customers in the United States to an external\nwebsite to complete the purchases, and thus avoid the 30% fee that\nApp Store takes. We quickly released <a href=\"https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons/\">Web Purchase Buttons</a>\nthat, combined with our <a href=\"https://www.revenuecat.com/billing/\">Web Billing</a> product, create a\nseamless way for developers to drive purchasers out of their app\nto the web for check out.</p>\n\n<p>IAP in the US is a $52B market, representing about half of all App\nStore revenue, and this is the first time that Apple has opened up\nsuch a major market to web purchasing. Previously, similar court\norders have been limited to much smaller markets. It has been much\ndebated over the years how much, or even if, this new-found\nfreedom would help developers make more money. The only real way\nto know is to run a test, so we took this opportunity to run the\nbiggest open test of web purchases in history.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, we deployed an experiment on Dipsea (the app we\nacquired last year as a testing-ground) and we’re excited to share\ninitial results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The initial conversion rate for IAP was around 28%; the conversion rate for the link-out web flow was just 18%. That’s a notable drop-off.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t find it surprising at all though. IAP really is more convenient. Apple’s built a great system, and they don’t need exclusivity to keep users preferring it, and thus keep developers using it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/15/revenuecat-external-purchase-report\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a34ca02475d8ca6800b796d95834448790805760c05d5e215b12b951054adf90","category":"Tech"}
