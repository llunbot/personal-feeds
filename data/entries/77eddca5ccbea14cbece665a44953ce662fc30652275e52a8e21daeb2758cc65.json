Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the physicist who led the research effort to develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about the race for the bomb, of varying quality. (As always, let me give a shout-out to <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/physics-and-the-human-factor-a-q-amp-a-with-the-writers-on-manh-a-ttan/\"><em>Manhattan</em></a>, a stellar fictional series that was tragically canceled after just two seasons.) How would Nolan make this very well-trodden material his own?</p>\n<p>I needn't have fretted. With <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)\">Oppenheimer</a>,</em> Nolan has gifted us a truly unique, unflinching, nuanced portrait of the enigmatic, complicated man who spearheaded the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project\">Manhattan Project</a> and subsequently ran afoul of the \"red-baiting\" politics of the McCarthy era. Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one. It's more like Nolan carefully selected various threads running through Oppenheimer's life and wove them into a richly textured tapestry that somehow transcends those raw materials. The result is pure visual poetry.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers below, although this is very well-documented history.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957638#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957638&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77eddca5ccbea14cbece665a44953ce662fc30652275e52a8e21daeb2758cc65","category":"Tech"}
