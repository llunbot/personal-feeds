Loop repeats the action in a continuous looping video, Bounce rewinds the action backward and forward, and Long Exposure simulates a DSLR-like long exposure effect by blurring motion. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following steps show how you can apply them to your own Live Photos on iPhone and iPad.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the Photos app and select a Live Photo. (If you look under \"Media Types\" in the <strong>Albums</strong> section, you'll find all of your Live Photos collated in a folder of the same name.)</li>\r<br />\n<li>With the Live Photo open, tap the <strong>LIVE</strong> icon in the top-left corner of the interface.</li>\r<br />\n<li>From the dropdown menu that appears, choose from <strong>Live</strong> (the default), <strong>Loop</strong>, <strong>Bounce</strong>, <strong>Long Exposure</strong>, and <strong>Off</strong>.</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/loop-bounce-live-photos.jpg\" alt=\"photos\" width=\"2760\" height=\"2760\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe effect you choose will be applied immediately, ready for you to share your creation using the Share icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's worth noting that with Live Photos, if you get a blurry image, you can open it up and see if other frames you captured are clearer, and then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/make-a-new-key-photo-in-live-photos/\">select a replacement \"key photo\" for it</a>.
