Reliable leaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1706190950232445368\">Kamila Wojciechowska</a> has a whole list of Pixel 8 and 8 Pro specs over at <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-8-pro-specifications-revealed/\">91mobiles</a>, along with some Pixel<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1706277114717040721\"> market materials</a>. The big news is that Google is finally giving its Pixel phones a longer support window. Pixel phones are getting <em>seven years</em> of updates, which is longer than Apple. Google pitches the Pixel phones as the flagship of the Android ecosystem, and now, if this spec sheet pans out, the OS maker is finally giving them an update plan to match.</p>\n<p>Currently, Pixel phones have three years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is not only beaten by Apple's update policy but is also inexplicably worse than many of Google's Android partners. For instance, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/samsung-now-updates-android-for-longer-than-google-does/\">Samsung</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/oneplus-adds-an-extra-year-to-its-update-promise-now-at-4-years-of-major-updates/\">OnePlus</a> offer four years of OS updates, albeit with some caveats around arrival times and the security update cadence. Apple doesn't have a policy written in stone anywhere, but with the iPhone X not <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/ios-and-ipados-17-drop-support-for-iphone-x-first-ipad-pros-and-other-old-devices/\">making the jump</a> to iOS17, that makes for a five-year major OS update policy if you're counting to 2022's iOS16, though with some point updates in 2023 you could argue six years.</p>\n<p>Google has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/pixel-6-leaks-five-years-of-security-updates-749-and-1049-price-tags/\">messed around</a> in the past by calling its current \"three years of major OS updates and five years of security updates\" plan \"five years of updates,\" but this spec sheet very clearly says \"seven years of OS, security, and feature drop updates.\" That would comfortably lead all major manufacturers, leaving only Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/fairphone-5-sets-a-new-standard-with-8-10-years-of-android-support/\">and Fairphone</a> at the top of the charts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970816#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970816&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"112eb558d80c3a3234b346346f2c10036a97d0333f384aef49b2d6a0cb341158","category":"Tech"}
