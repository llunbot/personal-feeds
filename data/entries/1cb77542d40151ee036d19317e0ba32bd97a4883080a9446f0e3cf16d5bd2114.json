It features a 6.7-inch 1 to 120Hz display, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, while the standard Pixel 8 has a 120Hz 6.2-inch display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle has updated the design of its Pixel smartphones, adding a polished aluminum frame and matte glass for the Pro and a satin metal frame and polished back glass for the standard Pixel. Google says the devices have softer silhouettes compared to the prior-generation models, and they come in new colors. Google is using Gorilla Glass Victus for both, but the Pro has Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for better durability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are equipped with Google's Tensor G3 chip with enhanced AI capabilities that can filter out more spam calls, improve image processing, erase background noise from videos, and boost call quality.

Google is also touting updated Google Assistant functionality, with the Assistant able to translate, read aloud, and summarize web pages, as well as distill key points about what's on the screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Pixel 8 Pro is priced starting at $999, which is the same starting price as Apple's ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, and the Pixel 8 is priced starting at $699.

Google says that with Safety Check, you can let friends and family know where you are, setting a timer for a check in.
