The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 firmware has a build number of 7A302, up from 7A294, and the ‌AirPods 4‌ firmware has a build number of 7A304.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Pro-Firmware-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nThere is no word yet on what’s included in the firmware, but it comes just a week after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-3/\">last updated</a> the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 firmware to add <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> features like support for head gestures and Voice Isolation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is adding hearing aid and hearing test functionality to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2, so this update could potentially introduce those capabilities, or it may lay the groundwork for a future update. Apple plans to introduce hearing aid features to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 this year, and the company has received FDA approval. Hearing aid functionality will not be included in the ‌AirPods 4‌. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple doesn’t have a way to manually upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air when the AirPods are in a charging case and connected to an iOS device or Mac.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/apple-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a302/\">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 Firmware</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-and-airpods-4-firmware.2436910/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"64e13ae81543d340b23b44e25001e633956a3d33a3d821750e62cfb384f8d6ba","category":"Apple"}
