Paired with the RockShox 140mm Pike Ultimate fork and Super Deluxe rear shock, this translates to a bike that is unflappable and right at home on twisty, steep descents.</p>\n<p>When it comes to climbing, ample space between the saddle and bar lets you put your body weight in the right place and the suspension robs very few watts.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the bike has a full <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-deore-xt-m8100-review/\">Shimano XT M8100 groupset</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/dt-swiss-ex-1501-spline-one-30-review/\">DT Swiss EXC 1501 wheels</a>, making this bike not just a great performer but excellent value for money too.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/bird-aether-9-review/\">Read our full Bird Aether 9 (2021) review </a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Boardman MTR 8.9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boardman MTR 8.9 has the same geometry as the MTR 9.0.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd  / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Fantastic all-rounder</li>\n<li>Limits become clear on extreme terrain</li>\n<li>£1,750 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Boardman MTR 8.9 has the same geometry and suspension as the pricier MTR 9.0.</p>\n<p>It has a well-chosen spec that balances cost, performance and strength, with a RockShox front fork, a<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\"> SRAM NX Eagle</a> drivetrain and Maxxis tyres.</p>\n<p>The triple-butted alloy frame looks purposeful and has externally routed cables, making for easy maintenance. There is a bottle mount too, but we found there to be minimal clearance.</p>\n<p>The geometry is modern but not extreme with a generous reach, leading to a comfortable ride.</p>\n<p>You do have to shift your weight forward to keep front-wheel traction over tricky ascents, and downhill the bike is fairly noisy. So really this is a bike for speedy trail centre rides, rather than super-challenging terrain.</p>\n<p>The bike is also ripe for upgrades and, with a few parts swapped out, we think it would be great as a lightweight, mile-munching machine.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/boardman-mtr-8-9-review/\">Read our full Boardman MTR 8.9 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Spectral 29 CF 7</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Quiet confidence, great suspension and impressive capability define the Canyon Spectral 29 CF 7.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Ideal handling for a trail bike</li>\n<li>Excellent frame finish and performance</li>\n<li>£3,599 / $3,999 / AU$5,299 / €3,399 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Canyon Spectral 29 CF 7 delivers an effortless ride, and we reckon most riders could jump on it and start setting personal bests straight away.</p>\n<p>The Spectral sees Canyon return to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in wheels</a> and a geometry that throws out no surprises, creating a bike with plenty of control that handles just as a trail bike should.</p>\n<p>The suspension also helps the Spectral achieve its excellent ride quality, with Canyon’s take on traditional four-bar linkage rivalling the very best rear suspension.</p>\n<p>The RockShox rear shock provides 150mm of supple travel that soaks up trail chatter. It has plenty of pop in the mid-stroke but remains rock solid when you stamp on the pedals.</p>\n<p>When it comes to componentry, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-gx-eagle-12-speed-drivetrain-review/\">SRAM GX Eagle groupset</a> makes sense for the price tag, but the G2 R brakes might lack the power you want and the Pike fork doesn’t have RockShox’ latest damper.

When climbing, the new geometry provides plenty of room for you to move and retain traction on steep sections and increased anti-squat figures help create a very stable feeling.</p>\n<p>The bike is equipped with Canyon’s own finishing kit and dropper post, as well as a Shimano XT drivetrain and DT Swiss wheels.

The handling is composed and the progressive 160/140mm travel is incredibly calm across rough terrain.</p>\n<p>Now in its fourth generation, the Troy has wider tyre clearance and an updated geometry that’s longer and slacker, helping deliver downhill stability.</p>\n<p>Devinci claims the Troy to be a one-bike quiver, and it’s probably as close as you’ll get. Despite the downhill performance, when you point the bike uphill it is efficient, though it would benefit from a steeper seat-tube angle to help move body weight over the bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>The Troy we tested was the top-of-the-range carbon model with parts to match, but Devinci also offers the Troy in an aluminium frame with a varying range of specs, so there’s likely to be a Troy for most budgets and riders.

But with some upgrades, this bike could be even more fun to ride.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/marin-hawk-hill-1-review/\">Read our full Marin Hawk Hill 1 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Marin Rift Zone Carbon 2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The water bottle is a tight fit in the frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Fantastic frame</li>\n<li>Great performance across riding disciplines</li>\n<li>£3,995 / $4,399 / AU$5,999 / €4,399 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Marin recently updated its Rift Zone, making it less of a cross-country orientated bike and shifting it towards the rowdier end of the riding spectrum.</p>\n<p>The new longer, slacker geometry is on the extreme side for a trail bike and the Rift Zone now veers closer to an enduro bike than other trail bikes.</p>\n<p>When you point the Rift Zone 2 downhill you can feel this new geometry come into its own.

And with powerful four-piston brakes, you’ll probably find yourself wanting to let it go.</p>\n<p>The long geometry does impact agility, though, and getting the front end up and over obstacles takes a bit of work.</p>\n<p>Common wisdom might suggest that such a long bike wouldn’t make a great climber, but the steep head tube helps counter the long wheelbase and makes this bike great on ascents. The rear suspension, which is incredibly stable, helps too.</p>\n<p>Combine all this with a great spec, and on the face of it the Privateer 141 is an excellent trail bike. But the handling can be slightly unruly which, given how far trail bikes have come in recent years, stops it from getting a higher score.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/privateer-141-slx-xt-review/\">Read our full Privateer 141 SLX XT review</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The CC X01 RSV is Santa Cruz’s range-topping 5010.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Composed and fun</li>\n<li>Only 130mm of travel, but still capable</li>\n<li>£7,599 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The new Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV is the brand’s top-flight version of its 5010.

It sticks to 650b wheels though and retains the fun factor of previous models.</p>\n<p>The suspension comes in the form of RockShox’ top-spec kit on the front and rear, providing 140mm/130mm of travel. Paired with the new geometry, this creates a ride that is capable and fast on descents, remaining composed but spurring you on, and is incredibly energetic on climbs when pushing power through the pedals. The handling is also razor-sharp.</p>\n<p>Fittingly for this carbon fibre bike, and its significant price tag, the finishing kit is top-tier too, with SRAM drivetrain and brakes and Santa Cruz’s own carbon Reserve rims built around DT Swiss hubs.</p>\n<p>This all comes together to create a bike that is seriously fun to ride. It’s not quite as playful as previous versions, but it is more capable and faster. And if the price is too steep, Santa Cruz offers the 5010 in less expensive builds.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/santa-cruz-5010-cc-x01-rsv-review/\">Read our full Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Saracen Ariel 30 Pro</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Saracen Ariel 30 Pro has a stretched-out geometry.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Stretched-out geometry</li>\n<li>Efficient pedalling and snappy ride feel</li>\n<li>£3,000 / €3,499 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Saracen’s Ariel 30 Pro sits at the trail bike sweet spot, with 130mm of travel at the front and rear courtesy of Fox.</p>\n<p>The aluminium bike has a long reach and slack head angle.

When climbing at lower speeds, we found the shock’s compression lever helped improve the ride.</p>\n<p>Overall, this bike feels well sorted but it’s probably one for play-in-the-woods types rather than mile eaters, due to its weight.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/whyte-t-160-rs-v1-review/\">Read our full Whyte T-160 RS V1 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2>Also consider…</h2>\n<p>In a mountain bike category as large as trail bikes, there are almost countless bikes to choose from, with pretty stiff competition.</p>\n<p>The following trail bikes didn’t score enough stars to be included in our main best list, or haven’t been subject to a full review just yet, but are still worth considering.</p>\n<p>They might just offer you what you’re after and those first rides might make their way onto the main list once our testers have put them thoroughly through their paces.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cannondale-scalpel-se-ltd-lefty-review/\">Canyon Scalpel SE LTD Lefty </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cotic-jeht-gold-gx-review/\">Cotic Jeht Gold GX </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/evil-offering-gx-hydra-review/\">Evil Offering GX Hydra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/giant-trance-x-advanced-pro-29-0-review/\">Giant Trance X Advanced Pro 29 0 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/hope-hb-130-long-term-review/\">Hope HB.130 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/intense-primer-29-expert-review/\">Intense Primer 29 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/lapierre-zesty-am-6-9-cf-review/\">Lapierre Zesty AM 6.9 CF </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/norco-sight-c2-29-review/\">Norco Sight C2 29 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/pace-rc295-ultimate-gx-review/\">Pacer RC295 Ultimate GX </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/transition-scout-gx-review/\">Transition Scout GX </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2021-specialized-stumpjumper-expert-review/\">2021 Specialized Stumpjumper Expert </a></li>\n</ul><hr /><h2>Trail bike buyer’s guide | Everything you need to know when choosing a trail bike</h2>\n<h3>What is a trail bike?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trail bikes might not have as much travel as enduro bikes, but that doesn’t stop them from flying down descents.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The trail mountain bike category occupies the space between lightweight, speed-focused cross-country bikes and enduro and all-mountain mountain bikes designed to fly downhill and slowly winch back to the top.</p>\n<p>Balancing pedalling efficiency and gravity potential, trail bikes aim to hit a sweet spot; they aren’t quite as rowdy as enduro bikes but are tougher than cross-country bikes.</p>\n<p>They make light work of riding down flow trails with big sweeping berms and can cut it on more demanding terrain too – and you might be surprised at just how capable they truly are.</p>\n<p>Really, trail bikes are best for mountain biking in the most general sense and are designed to give you just about enough of everything.</p>\n<p>Trail bikes also tend to be relatively affordable when compared to other types of mountain bike. The components don’t have to be super-lightweight as on XC bikes, or heavy-duty enough to survive the rigours of downhill, which helps to keep costs down.</p>\n<p>Although enduro and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a> are considered to be the Formula 1 of mountain biking, we think trail bikes are the most important and widest-spanning category, and benefit from economies of scale where bigger production runs also play a factor in keeping prices down.</p>\n<p>The affordability of trail bikes combined with their versatility, helps to make them an ideal choice if you’re new to the world of mountain biking or are looking for a one-bike solution to all your mountain biking needs.</p>\n\n<h3>What to look for in a trail bike</h3>\n<p>There are no set rules when it comes to defining what a trail bike is and, like all mountain biking sub-disciplines, they exist on a sliding scale in terms of capability, geometry, suspension travel and price.</p>\n<p>However, there are various factors that when put together constitute a trail bike and are worth bearing in mind when looking for one of these versatile machines.</p>\n<h4>Frame material</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aluminium is a good choice if you’re on a budget, but carbon bikes are extremely desirable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many brands stick to aluminium alloy or carbon fibre for trail bike frames, while some more boutique builders opt for alternative frame materials, such as steel or titanium.</p>\n<p>Carbon has the advantage of being lighter and stronger, and can be made to be stiffer than an equivalent aluminium frame, so it’s a good choice if zipping uphill and weight are priorities. It does, however, cost more than aluminium.</p>\n<p>While it might not have the exotic feel of carbon, or be as lightweight, an aluminium frame is a good call if you’re new to the sport or on a budget, but it’s hard to argue with the desirability and performance of carbon.</p>\n<h4>Geometry</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Longer and slacker, many modern trail bikes are built for descending.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">Frame geometry</a> probably has the biggest impact on how a mountain bike handles, with even slight adjustments to the wheelbase, head tube angle and reach determining how a bike feels.</p>\n<p>In keeping with their Goldilocks position between XC and enduro bikes, trail bikes have a relatively slack geometry that makes them capable enough to handle most rough descents, while being suitable for all-day epics and plenty of comfortable and efficient climbing.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, trail bikes have a head tube angle of between 64 and 66.5 degrees and seat tube angle of between 73 and 78 degrees.</p>\n<p>Look for slacker head tube angles if you want a bike that will descend better, because a slacker angle helps give the bike a calmer ride by slowing down the steering. It also makes its wheelbase longer, which helps improve stability at high riding speeds.</p>\n<h4>Travel</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trail bikes come with a variety of different suspension systems.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most commonly, trail bikes have front and rear suspension with between 120mm and 150mm of travel.</p>\n<p>As travel increases, a bike will be better suited to riding downhill and less suitable for climbing, so when considering how much travel to go for on a trail bike think about the type of terrain you’ll spend most of your time riding and your riding style.</p>\n<p>If you ride on rougher, more technical trails, or like to barrel down descents, choosing a trail bike with 140mm or 150mm is advisable.</p>\n<p>Shorter-travel bikes won’t descend quite as well, but they are light and efficient so are a good choice if endurance riding and climbing is more your thing.</p>\n<h4>Wheel size and tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Maxxis tyres and DT Swiss wheels are common choices for off-the-shelf trail bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There used to be a time when mountain bikes simply had 26in wheels. But those days are long gone, and now mountain bikes come with either 27.5in or 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>Both wheel sizes have their <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">advantages and disadvantages</a>. 29in wheels roll over obstacles and hold their momentum more, making them the preference for cross-country and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">best downcountry mountain bikes</a>. Compared to 29in wheels, 27.5in wheels are faster accelerating, stronger and more agile, with handling and placement feeling more natural too.</p>\n<p>Trail bikes come with either of the two sizes and there isn’t really a right or wrong answer to which size wheels you should go for – you might prefer the snappier feel of 27.5in wheels or value the efficiency of 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>One thing to bear in mind when selecting what wheel size to go for is your height. A taller rider will probably benefit from a larger wheel, whereas a shorter rider will benefit from a smaller wheel. Some manufacturers do consider this and provide models with different-size wheels depending on frame size.</p>\n<p>Trail bike tyres tend to be chunkier with a decent amount of tread and are around 2.3 to 2.5in wide. These provide a decent amount of grip and help make trail bikes the versatile machines they are.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">best mountain bike tyres</a> can really change how your bike feels, so it’s worth paying attention to what tyres a trail bike is specced with, but also remember that it’s not too hard to swap tyres out for something more suitable for your riding.</p>\n<h4>Drivetrain</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You might find that trail bikes have a mix of different groupsets, such as Shimano XT and SLX.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Trail bikes tend to have drivetrains with one front chainring. Thanks to wide-ranging 12-speed cassettes (normally between 10 to 52t), only having one front chainring doesn’t limit climbing potential.</p>\n<p>Groupsets such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-deore-xt-m8100-review/\">Shimano’s Deore XT M8100</a> are a popular choice on trail bikes. Trail bikes also tend to have easier gearing than speed-focused XC bikes. Front rings are usually between 30- and 34-tooth, while rear cassettes can go up to 52-tooth.</p>\n<p>This gives trail bikes a wide range of gears for enough speed on the flat and to help you get up tough climbs.</p>\n<h4>Brakes</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some trail bikes come with four-piston brakes to provide a load of stopping power.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like most aspects of trail bikes, the brakes strike a balance between stopping power and weight saving.</p>\n<p>Trail bikes will generally come with disc brakes that have two- or four-piston calipers. Four-piston brakes are more powerful and are aimed at downhill riding, where more braking power is needed, but this will of course add weight.</p>\n<p>Rotors on trail bikes are often a mix, with up to 200mm both front and back. The larger the disc rotor, the more powerful the brakes will be, but this also comes with a weight penalty.</p>\n<p>Hydraulic brakes are standard on all full-suspension trail bikes costing £1,000 or above, and often the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\">best mountain bikes under £1,000</a> come with these brakes too.</p>\n<h4>Handlebar</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A wide bar gives extra control and stability, making for easier descending.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Wide mountain bike handlebars are becoming the norm, and provide extra stability, comfort and control.</p>\n<p>Trail bikes follow this trend, many coming with a 760mm or 780mm bar, while some go up to 800mm. Just as smaller-sized trail bikes tend to have smaller 27.5in wheels, they also come with a narrower bar, going down 740mm, to help make the bike a better fit for smaller riders</p>\n<h4>Dropper posts</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Versatility at the flick of a switch.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">Dropper posts</a> are almost standard on trail bikes.</p>\n<p>They allow you to lower and raise your saddle with the flick of a handlebar-mounted button, giving you extra room to move your weight around on descents and the correct saddle height for efficient pedalling.</p>\n<p>A dropper post is one of the first upgrades you should consider if your trail bike doesn’t have one, because it will open the bike up to a wider range of riding.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a3ee3c33af2315d9ce2d210538c512081c0ef547c79bcbb4036dce496c72104a","category":"Cycling"}
