The newly-updated V2 sees some updates to a slightly more progressive geometry and a new UDH hanger to future-proof this bike even more. Named after the famous Marty Robbins song, the Big Iron was developed to take on everything from quick rips on the local groomed single track or an epic 1100 mile journey across Alaska. These new updates, along with a lifetime warranty really sweeten the Big Iron this winter!
