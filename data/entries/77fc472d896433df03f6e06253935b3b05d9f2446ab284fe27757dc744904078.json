Our team is in the weeds with MADE coverage right now but we wanted to post a thank you to everyone who came out and shared in the stoke of Wende! </p>\n<p>A huge thanks to YAKIMA for sponsoring the screening, We Are One for the bevs, and the MADE crew for showing the film!</p>\n<p>We’ve got more showings of Camera Corner on the way. The next is in Santa Fe at the Jean Cocteau theater on the 25th of September and we’ll be sharing how to host a screening once we’re back from MADE.</p>\n<p>xo</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/made-camera-corner-premiere/\">Camera Corner World Premiere!
