The 840-series uses a touchscreen and buttons, whereas the 540-series relies solely on buttons. Garmin has also rolled out ClimbPro 2.0, enabling riders to see the profile of an upcoming climb without navigation.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>The screen dimensions of both computers are 2.3×3.4×0.8in.</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>The Edge 840 Solar retails for £519.99/$599/€599.99/AU$879 and the 540 Solar for £449.99/$499/€499.99/AU$749.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Garmin is also launching the Edge 840 and 540, which forego solar charging but otherwise share the same features.
