The delayed update could be attributed to the technical requirements of implementing AI capabilities in a budget-friendly $349 device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current 10th-generation ‌iPad‌ has an A14 chip that was first used in the iPhone 12 lineup, and it's getting outdated. The logical choice for the next ‌iPad‌ is the A16 that was used in the iPhone 15 models, but if Apple wants to make Apple Intelligence as accessible as possible, an A17 Pro chip or A18 chip would likely be necessary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, Apple last week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/\">announced</a> the latest iPad mini with Apple Intelligence support via a standalone press release. The company also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/apple-reduces-pad-price-europe-no-charger/\">lowered the price</a> of the existing iPad 10 and stopped including a charger with the device in Europe. It's highly unlikely that Apple would have changed its iPad lineup in this way if an iPad 11 was imminent.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if Apple is still planning to host a Mac-focused event in October, but it seems that an iPad 11 will not be announced this month either way.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/entry-level-ipad-apple-intelligence-late-2025/\">New Entry-Level iPad With Apple Intelligence Likely Coming Late 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-likely-coming-late-2025.2440584/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4feb58a327364273904f041d930a2c649b5b199ba7c7508b469583f5acceb665","category":"Apple"}
