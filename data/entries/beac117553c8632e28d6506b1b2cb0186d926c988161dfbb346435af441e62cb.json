{"title":"My long quest to revive a ’90s Windows gaming cult classic","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986792","date":1701345635000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>The elusive, addictive gameplay that has been haunting my dreams for years. </p></div>\n<p>As 2023 draws to a close—and as we start to finalize our Game of the Year contenders—I really should be catching up on the embarrassingly long list of great recent releases that I haven't put enough time into this year. Instead, over the last few days, I've found myself once again hooked on a simple, addictive, and utterly unique Japanese Windows freeware game from the late '90s that, until recently, I thought I had lost forever.</p>\n<p><em>Pendulumania</em> is a cult classic in the truest sense of the word: Few people have heard of it, even in hardcore gaming circles, but those who have experienced it tend to have very fond memories of it. And while I shared those memories, it wasn't until this week that I've been able to share my effusive praise for a game whose name and playable executable had eluded me for well over a decade.</p>\n<h2>Timeless design</h2>\n<p>The mechanics of <em>Pendulumania</em> are incredibly simple. You use the computer mouse to control a metal ring, which is attached via an elastic string to a white ball. The object is to carefully move the ring so the stretchy string and gravity can nudge the ball around a 2D plane, crashing into floating scoring orbs to collect points (colored orbs that randomly appear can make the ball larger or the string stronger as well). Be careful, though; if the elastic string stretches too far, it will break and your game will be over.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986792#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986792&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"beac117553c8632e28d6506b1b2cb0186d926c988161dfbb346435af441e62cb","category":"Tech"}
