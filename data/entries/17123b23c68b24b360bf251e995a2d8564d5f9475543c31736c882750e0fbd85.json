However, these aren’t exactly new bikes, rather they are pre-existing offerings dressed up in new clothes that aim to add a little all-road flair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale previously took a similar approach to ‘gravelfy’ its Synapse endurance road by adding the “SE” designation, while a change of spec and a slight tweak to the model name is quite common amongst cross country mountain bikes, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Roadmachine X One and Two</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbon fibre version of the 2022 Roadmachine X shares an identical frameset to the current generation and second-tier <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/06/bmc-roadmachine-2020-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Roadmachine that was updated for 2020</a>. This second-tier version keeps the brake hoses external of the stem and headset and employs a more traditional round steerer fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roadmachine platform has long been a bike the CT team have liked for its sporty nature and a middle-ground approach to geometry that sits somewhere between race-focused machines and relaxed endurance sleds. The frame offers a number of comfort-inducing (flex) features in the frame, fork and seatpost, and has room for up to 33 mm rubber. That tyre clearance is certainly a limiting factor when viewing the Roadmachine X as anything more than a modern road bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-Roadmachine-X-Two-2022-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The Roadmachine X Two. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BMC will use most of that available tyre clearance by equipping the Roadmachine X One and Roadmachine X Two with 32 mm WTB Expanse tubeless tyres. Available immediately, the X One features <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/sram-xplr-drivetrain-review/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM’s new Force AXS XPLR 1×12 gravel groupset</a> and retails for €5,999. Coming April 2022, the X Two will be priced at €4,699 and feature the Rival version of the XPLR groupset. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Roadmachine X AL One </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The metal version of the new Roadmachine X is a very different bike to the carbon. BMC doesn’t offer an alloy version of its Roadmachine road bike and so has seemingly repurposed its<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/bmc-announces-urs-al-for-2022-another-new-alloy-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\"> newly released URS AL gravel bike</a> and given it tighter-fitting outerwear and a different name. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, 32 mm tyres are fitted in the frameset that has room for up to 45 mm rubber. And BMC has made the effective reach a little more aggressive by fitting longer stems across each size. What remains are the URS’ various mounting points, a longer trail figure and a longer wheelbase versus what the carbon version of the Roadmachine X offers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BMC will offer just one model of the alloy bike, with the Roadmachine X AL One priced at €2,299. When it eventually becomes available in May 2022, this bike will feature a Shimano GRX 800 2×11 groupset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All up the Roadmachine X doesn’t appear to bring anything truly new to BMC’s range, but I guess there’s little downside to having more options available to how people may want to modify their bikes. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/bmcs-new-roadmachine-x-is-a-bike-you-likely-already-know/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"17123b23c68b24b360bf251e995a2d8564d5f9475543c31736c882750e0fbd85","category":"Cycling"}
