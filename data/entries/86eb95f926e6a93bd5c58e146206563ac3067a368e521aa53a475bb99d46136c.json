{"title":"Sonar Is Now Taska","link":"https://madebywindmill.com/taska/","date":1713899992000,"content":"\n<p>Made by Windmill recently launched a fantastic Mac App for GitHub and GitLab issues. When it launched two months ago (and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/\">sponsored DF</a>), it was named Sonar. They’ve changed the name to Taska, but it’s the same great app from the same great team. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/25/sonar\">As I wrote when thanking them</a> (now with the new name):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Taska combines the lightweight UI of a to-do app with the power of\nenterprise-level issue tracking, all in a native app built by\nlong-time Mac nerds. The interface is deceptively simple, and very\nintuitive. Fast and fluid too. Everything that’s great about\nnative Mac apps is exemplified by Taska. If you’ve ever thought,\n“Man, if only Apple made a native GitHub client...”, you should\nrun, not walk, to download it.</p>\n\n<p>Taska saves all your changes directly to GitHub/GitLab using their\nofficial APIs, so your data remains secure on GitHub’s servers — not Taska’s. Do you have team members not using Taska? No problem.\nChanges you make in Taska are 100% compatible with the web UI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Free to try for 14 days — no subscriptions or purchases required. Taska remains my favorite new Mac app of the year.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/23/taska\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"86eb95f926e6a93bd5c58e146206563ac3067a368e521aa53a475bb99d46136c","category":"Tech"}
