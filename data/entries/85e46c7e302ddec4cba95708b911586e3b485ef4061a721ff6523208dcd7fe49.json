For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, a Reddit user named \"chaindrop\" <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1244h2c/will_smith_eating_spaghetti/\">shared the AI-generated video</a> on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MagusWazir/status/1640555696750993415?s=20\">quickly spread</a> to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgw8ek/ai-will-smith-eating-spaghetti-hill-haunt-you-for-the-rest-of-your-life\">Vice</a> said the video will \"haunt you for the rest of your life,\" while the AV Club <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/will-smith-scarlett-johansson-joe-biden-ai-spaghetti-1850283199\">called it</a> the \"natural end point for AI development.\"</p>\n<p>We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927886#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927886&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85e46c7e302ddec4cba95708b911586e3b485ef4061a721ff6523208dcd7fe49","category":"Tech"}
