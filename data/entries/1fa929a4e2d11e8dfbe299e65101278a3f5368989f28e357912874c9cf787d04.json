The Watch won’t be able to show systolic and diastolic measurements, but Apple will also reportedly provide a blood pressure journal so that the wearer can record the event and what led up to it. Gurman states that the feature will also “direct a user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements.” The blood pressure monitor could provide exact measurements in a future implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been working on blood pressure monitoring for quite some time, having filed <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674155/apple-patents-way-to-measure-blood-pressure-from-wrist.html\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675735/patent-blood-pressure-measurement-coming-to-apple-watch.html\">patents</a> over the years. The feature has been described as extremly difficult to implement on a watch, with Apple having “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631747/apple-watch-health-blood-pressure-glucose-development.html\">hit some snags</a>” during its development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the same developmental lines, Apple has been long at work on blood glucose monitoring and has decided to take a similar approach as it will with blood pressure: look for trends instead of providing exact data, and then suggest to the wearer on actions to take. However, this feature still needs time to develop and may not be ready for a while, according to reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Apple Watch could also get the ability to check for sleep apnea by monitoring the wearer’s breathing and sleep patterns. If the patterns fit, the Watch will recommend seeing a physician.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also said in the article, as well as in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1656002/airpods-update-health-features-hearing-aid-fda.html\">previous reports</a>, that Apple will be developing the AirPods to act more as a health tool. Next year, AirPods could have the ability to act as over-the-counter hearing aids, as well as be able to perform hearing tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other health features Apple is considering include a digital, paid health coaching service that would involve using artificial intelligence and data from Apple devices to make workout and eating plans; and anti-anxiety and workout features for the Apple Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman’s article also includes details on how Apple embarked on its health initiatives. Gurman uncovers how Apple created a secret subsidiary called Avolonte, how doctors and engineers working for Apple were frustrated by the company’s conservative approach, and how Apple’s approach to healthcare developed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has previously been reported that the Apple Watch Series 10 will bring a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2030272/apple-watch-x-anniversary-thinnner-case-magnetic-bands-blood-pressure.html\">major redesign</a> for the first time with a thinner body and magnetic bands. Apple is expected to unveil the watch next September, so there is a lot of time for plans to change.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1fa929a4e2d11e8dfbe299e65101278a3f5368989f28e357912874c9cf787d04","category":"Apple"}
