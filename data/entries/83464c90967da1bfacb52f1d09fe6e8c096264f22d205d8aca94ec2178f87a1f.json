Specifically, the supplier will be responsible for developing key mechanical components and casings for the tabletop robot. Once the product moves into mass production, Hongzhun will be tasked with producing the mechanical parts on a large scale. Hongzhun is a subsidiary of Foxconn, a longstanding manufacturing partner of Apple. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt its most recent shareholders' meeting, Hongzhun announced its intention to invest in emerging technologies such as robotics and AI, signaling a move away from its traditional focus on producing casings for laptops and game consoles. Hongzhun has prior experience in assembling Foxconn's own \"FoxBot\" robot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's robot project, reportedly code-named J595 internally, is described <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/\">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> as a desktop device that combines an iPad-like display with a robotic arm. It is designed to serve as a central hub in Apple's smart home ecosystem, integrating with other Apple products and services like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and run a variant of iPadOS. It could be introduced as soon as 2026, with an estimated price tag of approximately $1,000.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-robot/\">Apple Robot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain/\">First Plans for Apple's Tabletop Robot Spotted in Supply Chain</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-plans-for-apples-tabletop-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain.2433913/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"83464c90967da1bfacb52f1d09fe6e8c096264f22d205d8aca94ec2178f87a1f","category":"Apple"}
