{"title":"How to use the Terminal to see what Mac processes are accessing the internet","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/200655/netprocesses.html","date":1627715700000,"content":"<div>\n<section><div></div></section><p>If you’ve ever wondered about which programs are using your internet connection at any point in time, here’s one way to find out using Terminal. Open Terminal, in Applications &gt; Utilities, and run this command: </p>\n\n\n\n<pre><strong><code>lsof -P -i -n | cut -f 1 -d \" \" | uniq</code></strong></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>When you press return, you’ll see a list of processes that are using the internet connection. At the time I wrote this, my output looked like this: </p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<pre><strong><code>COMMAND\nAppleVNCS\nPTHPasteb\nSystemUIS\naosnotify\niTunes\nGrowlHelp\nTransmit\niChatAgen\nfirefox-b\nVPNClient\nMail</code></strong></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The first row, <code><strong>COMMAND</strong></code>, is just the column header. Below that are the processes that are using the internet connection. Most of the time, they are self-explanatory, or can be figured out with relative ease. On my list, most of the entries are pretty clear, but perhaps not <code><strong>aosnotify</strong></code>. A bit of work with Google, though, determines that that process is related to MobileMe syncing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nIf you just want to use this command, you know all you need to know now. If you’re curious <em>how</em> it works, though, then keep reading.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p> While the command may look complex, it’s actually three relatively simple commands strung together with the pipe (<code><strong>|</strong></code>) symbol. The first one, <code><strong>lsof -P -i -n</strong></code>, runs <code><strong>lsof</strong></code> to list open files, with options set to focus only on those connections using the Internet connection (<code><strong>-i</strong></code>), and to not try to convert port and host numbers into names (<code><strong>-P</strong></code> and <code><strong>-n</strong></code>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p> The output from this command is then sent to <code><strong>cut</strong></code>, which cuts out everything except the first field (<code><strong>-f 1</strong></code>), based on using spaces to delimit fields (<code><strong>-d \" \"</strong></code>). Finally, that output is sent to <code><strong>uniq</strong></code>, which strips out duplicate entries from the list—without this last bit, you’d see a lot of repetition in the list, because every open app will have multiple open files. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> That’s all there is to it.
