{"title":"We Found the Sucker Willing to Buy Humane, and as Promised, I’m Going to Be Insufferable, Because of Course It Was HP","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/hp-116-million-deal-for-humane-includes-ip-but-no-ai-pin-device","date":1739918534000,"content":"\n<p>Brody Ford, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HP Inc. will acquire assets from Humane Inc., the maker of a\nwearable Ai Pin introduced in late 2023, for $116 million.</p>\n\n<p>The deal will include the majority of Humane’s employees in\naddition to its software platform and intellectual property, the\ncompany said Tuesday. It will not include Humane’s Ai pin device\nbusiness, which will be wound down, an HP spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>Humane’s team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany\nBongiorno, will form a new division at HP to help integrate\nartificial intelligence into the company’s personal computers,\nprinters and connected conference rooms, said Tuan Tran, who leads\nHP’s AI initiatives. Chaudhri and Bongiorno were design and\nsoftware engineers at Apple Inc. before founding the startup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale\">Yours truly, last May</a>, when news broke that Humane was looking for a buyer, “seeking a price of between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I suspect they’ll sell for a pittance — way less than the $230\nmillion they’ve raised. I just don’t see what they have to offer.\nHumane doesn’t own the AI that powers the AI Pin — that comes\nfrom OpenAI, which seemingly not only doesn’t want to buy Humane,\nbut is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23893939/jony-ive-openai-sam-altman-iphone-of-artificial-intelligence-device\">supposedly in exploratory talks</a> with Jony Ive’s\nLoveFrom to design and build their own AI devices. The laser\nprojector idea seems to be a bust, and the hardware’s battery life\nis measured in hours between battery pack swaps.</p>\n\n<p>Off the top of my head, the only company that could afford a $1\nbillion-ish price for Humane <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/304397/the-hp-autonomy-lawsuit-timeline-of-an-ma-disaster.html\">is dumb enough</a> to do\nit is HP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, at least we can say HP was smart enough not to spend $1 billion on this. But they were dumb enough to bring into their company Chaudhri, who was described to me, by someone who worked with him at Apple (and a person whom I’ve never heard badmouth a single other former colleague), as “an utter fraud”. But a fraud whose <a href=\"http://www.imranchaudhri.com/\">personal website</a> is an inadvertent testimony to the lunacy of the U.S. patent system — that it serves ego inflation, not innovation.</p>\n\n<p>But who knows? Maybe I’m all wet and Humane will prove to HP what NeXT proved to Apple, and we’ll all be hanging on every thread of Imran Chaudhri keynotes in a few years and he’ll lead HP back to greatness. (Almost laughed spittle onto my screen there.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3132021e72a7c50987ddfcbbab58ba18c69efced0224ec17c381a757d5a28fbc","category":"Tech"}
