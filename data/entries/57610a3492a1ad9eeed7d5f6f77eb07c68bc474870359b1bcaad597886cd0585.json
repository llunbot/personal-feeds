I had a big meltdown, mentally I was not in the right place. I had spent all day at home and there was only a short amount of time that the government was allowing us to leave the house for sports activities in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>It was the 4th of May 2020. I planned a route very meticulously as I wanted to get the best views of the sunset. So, I packed some of my bags and of course remembered a hip bag with my camera and a few lenses, got my MTB ready, checked it and put some oil on the chain, removed the front wheel so it would fit in the elevator, and opened the door to a new adventure…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/megamo-track-20210917-jbd-3049.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/megamo-track-20210917-jbd-3055.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When I started to put this bike together I wanted it to reflect my favorite moment; a sunset. This was mainly because for me it’s the best part of the day, it’s that moment when you look back and realize all the things you’ve done. It moves me when I look at that certain pallet of colors in the sky and realize that the day is winding down but has not ended yet. Sunsets are romantic much in the same way as my feelings for the bike. It’s a passionate relationship that started many years ago, and even if I sometimes want to, I can’t leave it behind. So, I keep going just as the days keep going too, and one sunset follows another.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/megamo-track-20210917-jbd-3078.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When I ride in the sunsets I fill myself with those amazing colors and even when I am at home, looking at the sunset on a photo on my wall, I can see all the beautiful mountains getting darker by the second while I imagine the sun disappearing behind them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/megamo-track-20210917-jbd-3037-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Now thanks to Megamo bicycles, CeramicSpeed, and the love and skill that Sergio Vergel Escribano from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/scolors/\" target=\"_blank\">Scolors</a> poured into the paint job, this vision has become a reality. “Fading” bike is real and I am ready to take it on some amazing adventures!</p>\n<p>SPECS<br />\nMegamo MTB Track frameset:<br />\nConstruction FSC Technology SuperLight<br />\nCarbon frame with internal wiring<br />\nFOX 34 Stepcast Kashima fork 120mm<br />\nFOX FS Kashima shock absorber<br />\nMegamo integrated carbon handlebar<br />\nSRAM XX1 AXS 12-speed transmission<br />\nShimano XT M8100 hydraulic disc brakes<br />\nEnve M525 MTB wheels<br />\nSeatpost Fox Transfer Factory Kashima with internal cable routing</p>\n<p>You can see more information at <a href=\"https://www.megamo.com/en/bikes/mountain/track-r120/track-r120-axs-01-(21)?id_regio=22\" target=\"_blank\">Megamo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ceramicspeed.com/en/cycling/shop/oversized-pulley-wheel-systems\" target=\"_blank\">CeramicSpeed</a>.</p>\n<p><em>About the bike, Megamo Track is a fast cross bike that can work on all kinds of terrain. I’ve specifically used it on bike parks, rocky trails and smooth paths. With now the three on-the-fly compression damping positions the new Fox fork is even more comfortable to shred around.
