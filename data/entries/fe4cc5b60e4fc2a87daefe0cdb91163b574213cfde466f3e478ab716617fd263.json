Think pro cycling needs a facelift?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could be in luck, if new proposals to transform cycling’s calendar and business model go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is allegedly behind plans to create a Champions League-style format to rival the existing cycling calendar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organisation fronting the changes – One Cycling – is the brainchild of Jumbo-Visma CEO Richard Plugge and Zdenek Bakala, owner of Soudal-QuickStep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five or six other major teams including Ineos Grenadiers and Lidl-Trek – also said to be part of One Cycling – allegedly back the proposal, although only EF Education-EasyPost have explicitly come out in favour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of a competing Saudi-backed league has led to concerns for the survival of pro cycling as we know it, as well as the future of smaller, less financially sound teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saudi investment is one of the most divisive issues in sport and it’s hard not to draw comparisons to golf here. An acrimonious divide between the longstanding PGA Tour and its new competitor, the PIF-owned LIV Golf Invitational Series, ended in a merger earlier this year – but not before several top players had been kicked out of the PGA for switching sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the plan?<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-at-2023-Tour-de-France-presentation-by-A.S.O.Jonathan-Biche.jpg 1890w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Jonathan Biche</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>News of the proposals – which are still secretive – first emerged in October, before a report by RadioCycling featuring Plugge confirmed it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It revealed the PIF’s involvement and a competitive, week-in-week-out ‘Champions League’ format, which could be in place as early as 2026, complete with a points rankings system to determine an overall champion at the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>EF Education-Easy Post manager Jonathan Vaughters explained the series would consist of some races that already exist in a heavily edited calendar. But this would require cooperation from the Amaury Sports Organisation, which controls the Tour de France, Vuelta, the Dauphiné and Paris-Roubaix, among many others.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, ASO is (understandably) said not to be keen to give up its monopoly over pro racing and the huge profits the Tour and other races make. The French organisation is also opposed to losing such a cultural icon – a stance that is likely shared by many people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the UCI appears to be on board with the plans, which gives the project added legs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dissent among the One Cycling teams over the distribution of money in bike racing appears to be a major factor in its creation. The majority of money earned over stage races and from lucrative TV deals goes to the organisers rather than the teams themselves, who are reliant on sponsors for survival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugge told Reuters, ‘It’s obvious that cycling is a sleeping giant and deserves an improved business model. For all the stakeholders, but especially for the WorldTour teams. The only way to get there is cooperation.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea would be to distribute the profits from TV rights packages of the calendar among participating teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The world is changing around us and our competitors are not the other teams; our competitors are football, rugby, NFL, Formula 1. We need to make sure we are future-ready as a sport,’ Plugge explained on RadioCycling. ‘We have to make sure that in five years’ time this sport is bigger than it is today. Everybody will benefit from that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaughters said, ‘This is not about anyone becoming rich – this is about stabilising the economics so that we do not run into situations like Jumbo-Visma almost going bankrupt at the end of the season.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What would it mean for cycling?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"A day in the life of a Tour photographer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/tour-de-france-photographer-01.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pete Goding / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Question marks hang over what a Saudi-backed circuit would actually look like, with opinions divided on how much of the existing schedule would be involved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If ASO were included, big races like the Tour de France would theoretically come under OneCycling and the PIF’s control – but if ASO, and other big players like the Giro d’Italia’s RCS, stand firm there could be two rival calendars. There’s also a chance that ASO could be convinced to give up some of its smaller races like Paris-Nice but maintain control of the Tour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key aim for OneCycling seems to be to commercialise the sport. The provisional calendar would be reduced and all races would take place or finish on a Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More significantly, no races would overlap. Riders and fans could avoid headaches like choosing between Tirreno-Adriatico and Paris-Nice, and spectators would get the chance to see more of the top riders battling it out early in the season before they came together at the Tour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another concern seems to be making cycling more advertiser- and TV-friendly, and drawing in a younger audience that may be put off by the complicated nature of pro racing’s current format, including lengthy events, and confusing traditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugge said, ‘If we have a really strong league, with fewer races, really strong and understandable, then I think the value for everybody will go up,’ he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of whether the league becomes a reality, Saudi involvement in the sport already is. ASO has said it intends to continue developing cycling in the Middle East, already running a Saudi and UAE Tour, and is – interestingly – planning to create a women’s version of the Saudi event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AlUla sponsor in Australian team Jayco-AlUla is the tourist board for the Saudi Arabian city of the same name, and Saudi architectural project NEOM City was also rumoured to be an option to replace title sponsor Jumbo at Jumbo-Visma, so cycling is far from reluctant to cosy up to the state. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling could see even more of a financial gap between its top teams – largely funded by oil money – and its less successful lower-ranked teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment no one has mentioned what a deal would mean for teams not involved in the plans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The split within golf involved many pros rebelling to join the LIV and being suspended from the PGA as a result. That sort of acrimony might be less likely given cycling’s team- rather than individual-based structure, but it’s certainly a possibility if there’s enough backlash to Saudi involvement. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the precedent?<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Bahrain-Victorious-at-2023-Liege-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel.jpg 1882w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Maxime Delobel</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The PIF has become a huge force in sport in recent years: it owns Newcastle United Football Club, has made major sponsorship deals in motorsports, bankrolled the LIV Tour, and is now investing billions in the newly merged golf circuit. So in some ways it’s not a surprise to see it moving into cycling as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling in its current form isn’t immune to Gulf state and oil money. Three of the UCI World Tour’s 18 teams are sponsored by a Gulf country: Tadej Pogačar’s UAE Team Emirates, Bahrain Victorious and Jayco-AlUla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s a far cry from a state controlling an entire racing series – and none of these teams wields as much influence as Jumbo-Visma or Soudal-QuickStep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happily for those who think the new plans are an ethical and logistical nightmare, there’s also precedent for this sort of thing to fall apart. In 2012, eight teams joined forces for a mooted Cycling World Series – which Soudal-QuickStep’s Bakala was also involved in – but it never took off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in 2014, 11 WorldTour squads got behind Velon, an organisation with the vague tagline ‘make cycling better’ and even vaguer goals of commercial opportunities for its teams. It still exists as a content machine, but its flagship event the Hammer Series was kiboshed by the UCI and it has since put all racing activity on hold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the UCI has the power to quash any new super league – but with it apparently behind the proposals, it might have a significantly better chance of success. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, seven of Europe’s biggest football clubs attempted to form a lucrative closed European Super League but the plan collapsed in the face of a huge wave of opposition. So if enough people object to cycling’s version, it could be dead in the water. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What has the reaction been?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Richard-Plugge-by-ASOCharly-Lopez.jpg 1890w\" /><figcaption>ASO/Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media and industry reactions have been largely muted while the plans are still in their infancy, but the major news is that the UCI is apparently onside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But gridlock appears likely as long as big players like ASO aren’t keen. And it does seem that any league that doesn’t involve the Tour de France – obviously cycling’s most famous, marketable, and successful race – will fail before it even gets off the ground. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cyclists have expressed a preference for the existing varied calendar and freedom of choice between races. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Plugge is also a divisive figure within cycling – 13 teams signed a letter at the start of this year expressing frustration with his management of the AIGCP (Association International des Groupes Cyclistes Professionels), of which he is president. So it’s possible that these WorldTour teams and others will refuse to get on board with a plan in which he’s so heavily involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Cookson, UCI president from 2013 to 2017, was critical of the existing format. He said, ‘Outside of the three Grand Tours and a small handful of one-day races, there are no profits from organising bike races. In fact most races are struggling to cover their costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Those companies that do make a profit, specifically ASO, aren’t going to share it with the teams, as previous attempts to reform pro road cycling have shown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If “investors” are to be brought in to make this happen, where is their ROI [Return On Investment] coming from, given that the profitable events won’t share and the other events have nothing to share?’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cookson also speculated that new plans to commercialise racing are likely to hurt the average cycling fan. He wrote, ‘Profits come ultimately from consumers paying to buy a commodity. The answer therefore is that, one way or another, those who want to “consume” cycling, i.e. watch it on TV, online, or at the roadside, will have to pay more than they currently do. That’s you, the cycling fan.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the unanswered questions?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/UAE-Team-Emirates-and-UAE-Team-ADQ-before-Liege-2023-by-A.S.O.Maxime-Delobel-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Maxime Delobel</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A Saudi-run calendar raises obvious questions over the fate of women’s cycling. Women’s cycling is already fighting for funding, equal pay, equal TV coverage, more races to fill the calendar, and just to be taken seriously in the first place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What a women’s circuit would look like under Saudi ownership is another question, because no women’s teams have been approached to be part of OneCycling’s plan, a fact which in itself is ruffling feathers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if a new Saudi-backed league set up competitor races, existing ones would likely struggle to compete with the depth of its pockets and ability to secure rights deals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaughters argues, ‘The stories go on of teams, including mine, that have almost had to disappear. This is about stabilising the underpinnings of the sport, which is good for everyone, so we are going to be very active and to push forward on this.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He and others are right to point out the instability in pro cycling, as funding is low, sponsorships and even teams can collapse, and riders have significantly less contractual security than in other sports. Many have for years demanded change in cycling’s business model and more support for riders who sacrifice so much to go and stay pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is a Champions League-style shakeup of the racing calendar controlled by the Saudi state the right way forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new proposals pose more questions than they answer, from the ethical to the practical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid ongoing concerns about greenwashing, would accepting oil money do terminal damage to cycling’s brand? Is taking money from the less-than-squeaky-clean Saudi state the right, ethical way to make the sport more financially rewarding? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And would the riders and staff actually be the beneficiaries of any new influx of cash, or would the status quo – complaints about race organisers hoarding cash at the expense of those putting in the hard yards – persist?</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/saudi-pro-cycling-league\">What is the rumoured Saudi racing league – and what would it mean for pro cycling?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"fclifford","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fe4cc5b60e4fc2a87daefe0cdb91163b574213cfde466f3e478ab716617fd263","category":"Cycling"}
