Cheng said the iPhone survived unscathed, adding that the move was the kind of calculated risk that Jobs was known to take as a showman.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"The memory underscores the kind of lengths Jobs went to in order to make an impression,\" wrote Cheng. \"Imagine how disastrous it would've been if that iPhone had broken or shut down in front of so many journalists.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nJobs famously introduced the original iPhone as if it were three separate products: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device. The crowd at Macworld San Francisco erupted with cheerful applause upon realizing that Jobs was referring to a single device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJobs passed away October 5, 2011 at the age of 56.
