The Vision Pro is priced starting at $3,499.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-headset-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2698\" height=\"1518\" />\r<br />\nGiven the high price point, there appears to be a single model, with no color options or accessories for the device, despite rumors. There could, however, be different storage options as Apple did mention a starting price. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headset will not be launching in 2023, with Apple instead planning to debut it in early 2024. When it launches, it will be available solely in the United States, though it will expand to other countries later on in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDemonstrations will be available at Apple retail locations closer to the device's launch date.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-vision-pro-3499-price/\">Apple Vision Pro Priced Starting at $3499, Will Launch in Early 2024 in the U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-priced-starting-at-3499-will-launch-in-early-2024-in-the-u-s.2391689/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c620f427f7f817b613f31be4cb6eab29751f845422d9cd674f4561296df8cf8a","category":"Apple"}
