In the U.S., the Pro Display XDR starts at $4,999, while the optional Pro Stand costs $999 extra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman today said a new Pro Display XDR is currently \"less of a priority for Apple\" as an expensive, niche product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2022, he said that Apple was working on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/\">updated version of the Pro Display XDR</a> with an Apple silicon chip, but it is unclear if that remains the company's plan as of today. In Apple's Studio Display, an A13 Bionic chip powers features such as Center Stage camera framing for video calls, spatial audio, and Siri voice commands.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nWhile no other features have been rumored for the next Pro Display XDR, customers are hopeful for a camera, speakers, and a higher refresh rate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Larger iMac</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1626\" height=\"914\" />\r<br />\nIt has been nearly three years since Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-discontinues-27-inch-imac/\">discontinued the 27-inch iMac</a>, as part of its move away from Intel processors. Since then, the 24-inch iMac has been Apple's only all-in-one desktop computer, with no larger model available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWill a larger iMac ever make a comeback? Gurman today merely said that Apple will \"probably eventually get around\" to it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt might not be another 27-inch iMac, specifically, though.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nIn November 2023, Apple announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/\">no plans to release a new version of the 27-inch iMac</a> with an Apple silicon chip at that time. Instead, Apple recommended pairing its standalone Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut an even larger iMac could materialize one day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn late 2023, both Gurman and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/\">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said Apple was developing a 32-inch iMac for release in late 2024 or in 2025. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen would feature mini-LED backlighting, which would allow for increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, and other benefits compared to LCD technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe late 2024 window has now passed, but a 2025 launch is still on the table, perhaps. Gurman's latest update on the larger iMac is vague, though.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/pro-display-xdr-2-and-larger-imac-rumors/\">Pro Display XDR 2 and Larger iMac: Here's What the Latest Rumors Say</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pro-display-xdr-2-and-larger-imac-heres-what-the-latest-rumors-say.2449490/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"08438463757fd726652a95c6b0abfabab2e5e7561e12df2df02b4a33afb29e0b","category":"Apple"}
