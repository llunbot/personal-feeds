Separately, <em>MacRumors</em> is aware that some Apple Stores in the UK recently received large deliveries on pallets, believed to be couches designed for Vision Pro demos, that staff are not yet allowed to open. Apple Retail Managers in the UK have been told to begin the process of planning to transition the Avenues to facilitate Vision Pro accessories. Further refreshes of in-store visuals are also planned for July.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe international launch of the Vision Pro is likely to fall in the third or fourth week of July. Given this timing, there is a chance that Apple will confirm the date at its WWDC keynote on June 10.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis time frame is later than anticipated by many analysts, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, who said that Apple was highly likely to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/\">launch the Vision Pro internationally</a> before WWDC to drive interest in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> 2.
