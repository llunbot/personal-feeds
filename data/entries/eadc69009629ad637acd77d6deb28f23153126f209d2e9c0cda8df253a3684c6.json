{"title":"Panos Panay Is Leaving Microsoft, Just Days Ahead of Their Surface Event","link":"https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1703776961296998693","date":1695063569000,"content":"\n<p>Panos Panay, on Twitter/X:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After 19 incredible years at Microsoft, I’ve decided to turn the\npage and write the next chapter. I’m forever grateful for my time\nat Microsoft and the amazing people I had the honor to make\nproducts with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878609/microsoft-windows-panos-panay-leaving\">Emma Roth, reporting for The Verge</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Panay’s departure from Microsoft is somewhat abrupt. Just last\nmonth, <a href=\"https://x.com/panos_panay/status/1696184684303315420?s=20\">Panay mentioned he was excited</a> to appear at\nMicrosoft’s special event that’s set to take place on Thursday,\nSeptember 21st, where the company is poised to reveal <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23874096/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-2-leak-specs\">the latest\nadditions to its Surface lineup</a> and “AI innovation.”\nHowever, Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw tells The Verge Panay\nwill not appear at this week’s event.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The timing on this is so awkward, given that the Surface event — that Panay was presumably set to emcee — is just three days from now. Microsoft’s terse statement and Panos’s tone in the tweet make it seem acrimonious, but not scandalous.</p>\n\n<p>And lo, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/amazon-is-poised-to-hire-departing-microsoft-product-chief\">Dina Bass and Matt Day report for Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Amazon.com Inc. is hiring Microsoft Corp.’s product chief to run\nthe division responsible for the voice-activated Alexa assistant\nand Echo smart speakers, according to people familiar with the\nsituation. Panos Panay, an almost 20-year veteran who led\nMicrosoft’s Windows team and was central to the company’s hardware\npush with its Surface computers, said Monday he’s leaving the\ntechnology giant.</p>\n\n<p>Dave Limp, the longtime Amazon hardware chief, said last month\nthat he would retire before the end of the year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wormsandviruses.com/2023/09/panos-panay-out-at-microsoft/\">Jack Wellborn</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have mixed opinions on Panos Panay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Same here. Panos without question elevated Microsoft to be a major player in PC hardware, but looking back, I don’t see any of their devices as iconic. From the get-go, I always wondered how hamstrung the Surface was (and remains) by Microsoft’s need to maintain good relations with other PC OEMs.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/panay-leaving-microsoft-for-amazon\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"eadc69009629ad637acd77d6deb28f23153126f209d2e9c0cda8df253a3684c6","category":"Tech"}
