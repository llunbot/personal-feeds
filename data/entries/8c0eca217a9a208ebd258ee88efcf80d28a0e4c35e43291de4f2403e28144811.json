Such was the case this year in Maryland, when the state saw its first locally acquired malaria case in <a href=\"https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Maryland-Department-of-Health-announces-positive-case-of-locally-acquired-malaria.aspx\">over 40 years</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7241a3.htm?s_cid=mm7241a3_w\">a report this week</a>.</p>\n<p>The misdiagnosis led the patient to a weeks-long treatment for the wrong infection and held up public health responses to pinpoint and thwart further transmission. To date, the source of the patient's infection remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>As global travel and climate warming expand malaria's range, awareness of the diagnostic pitfall and better testing will be increasingly needed, the report's authors suggest. The report was published Thursday in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975941#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975941&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c0eca217a9a208ebd258ee88efcf80d28a0e4c35e43291de4f2403e28144811","category":"Tech"}
