They range in size from 7 to 70 billion parameters and reportedly \"outperform open source chat models on most benchmarks we tested,\" according to Meta.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is going to change the landscape of the LLM market,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ylecun\">tweeted</a> <span>Chief AI Scientist</span> Yann LeCun. \"Llama-v2 is available on Microsoft Azure and will be available on AWS, Hugging Face, and other providers.\"</p>\n<p>According to Meta, its Llama 2 \"pretrained\" models (the bare-bones models) are trained on 2 trillion tokens and have a context window of 4,096 tokens (fragments of words). The context window determines the length of the content the model can process at once. Meta also says that the Llama 2 fine-tuned models, developed for chat applications similar to ChatGPT, have been trained on \"over 1 million human annotations.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954747#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954747&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4503251699086805ba4fd6d2d5fa957f0d8bfc0bdffea74b9b487a71408d8c70","category":"Tech"}
