And today’s that price is even better: Amazon is selling <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ?th=1\">the 11-inch M2 iPad Air for $500</a>, $99 off its MSRP, and just $2 off its all-time low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365408/11-inch-ipad-air-m2-review.html\">4-star review</a> of the 11-inch iPad Air, we praised its processor upgrade and performance, as well as the fact the upgrade to 128GB base storage, essentially cutting the price by $50. “The lower entry-level price, the increased basic memory capacity of 128GB, and the front camera on the long edge are all pleasing upgrades for this generation of Air. The fact that the iPad has also been given the next chip up, the M2, is also welcome.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, it’s very similar to the previous model, which isn’t a bad thing. It’s got a gorgeous 11-inch Liquid Retina display as well as a 12MP ultra-wide front camera with Center Stage. This will ensure that even if you move around the room, the camera will focus on you. It’s also ready for Apple Intelligence as it continues its rollout throughout 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss out on the chance to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ?th=1\">get an iPad Air for $500 at Amazon</a>, a fantastic price for one of the best tablets out there.</p>\n\n\n<span>A stellar tablet for a stellar price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0324780a05199278317ab0f8a6d7cbfa2fd38c1f3bbd0d973b418e136e8b6a28","category":"Apple"}
