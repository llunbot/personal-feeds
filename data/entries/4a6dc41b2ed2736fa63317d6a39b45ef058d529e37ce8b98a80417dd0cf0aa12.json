The futuristic-looking electric vans will be provided in a right-hand drive configuration for ease of deliveries.</p>\n<p>\"The multi-purpose platform with steer-by-wire technology, and a unique low-profile suspension system allows for a readily configurable right-hand drive system while maintaining desired roll and ride stability,\" said Canoo CEO and Executive Chairman Tony Aquila.</p>\n<p>The news comes two days after the USPS formally unveiled its first EV charging stations, which have been installed at its South Atlanta Sorting and Delivery Center. It's the first in what will be hundreds of installations at about 400 sites across the US, which the USPS says it will convert to sorting and delivery centers that will act as local hubs for EVs on local carrier routes. Currently, it has opened 29 so far.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998578#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998578&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
