But just how long should you expect a Mac to last?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be considering buying a secondhand Mac and wondering how old is too old? For example, is that 2017 MacBook Pro for $300/£300 a good deal, or would you be better off spending a bit more on a newer model?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One factor to consider is the age at which most Macs start to experience issues, such as random shutdowns and degraded batteries that no longer hold their charge. Unfortunately, at one point repairing your Mac or MacBook will no longer be a viable option and you will need to look for a replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue with aging Macs is that the software you need may not run on it. You may also find that Apple no longer supports the operating system software that runs on that Mac – which could leave you open to malware and security vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we will address the above, as well as give advice about which Macs are still supported by Apple, the Macs that can still be repaired if required (Apple stops providing the required parts after a number of years), and the Macs that Apple considers obsolete and vintage. Being Vintage means Apple may have the parts available if you wanted to fix the Mac, but once Obsolete Apple will not provide parts if you want to try and fix the machine. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When do I need to replace my Mac?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few indicators that your Mac has reached the end of its useful life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple no longer supports the latest version of the software it runs (which could leave you vulnerable).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The apps you need to use no longer run on it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Mac struggles to perform the tasks you need it to – especially if you can’t update the RAM or any other components.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Something breaks and is too expensive to fix, or the parts aren’t available.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Mac is becoming unreliable. Unexpected shutdowns are becoming commonplace and you’ve tried everything to fix the problem to no avail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3783678/MacbookAir11_lifestyle_21_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Old MacBook Air\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Old MacBook Air\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Old MacBook Air\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Macs are supported by macOS updates?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Only the most recent version of macOS gets feature updates, but Apple usually maintains the last three versions of the macOS with bug fixes and important security updates, ensuring that the latest version of Safari will run, and that Apple Services, such as iCloud, are fully supported</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that Apple will currently provide support for these <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672681/list-of-all-macos-versions-including-the-latest-macos.html\">versions of macOS</a>: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma</a> (macOS 14), and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678251/macos-13-ventura-features-compatibility-download-install.html\">macOS Ventura</a> (macOS 13). Prior to the arrival of Sequoia in September 2024, Monterey (macOS 12) was also supported, but now Monterey has fallen off that list and with it Mac from before 2017, and in some cases, 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Mac is running Sequoia, Sonoma, or Ventura you should be able to be confident that Apple will keep an eye on any security vulnerabilities and other problems with these operating systems. (Indeed, Apple issued a security update for Sonoma and Ventura on the day that Sequoia arrived). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if your Mac is running an older version of the operating system, such as macOS Big Sur, macOS Catalina or older, you will find yourself out in the cold when it comes to essential security updates to Apple’s software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the software is too old you may also find that your other Apple products aren’t compatible with your Mac. Without the latest security update, you may no longer be able to use Apple Pay or other means to pay for services online, for example. And if you want to sync your iPad or iPhone with your Mac (rather than using iCloud) you will need a recent version of macOS. Since Catalina, syncing is done via the Finder, rather than iTunes. If you can’t run Catalina you will need at least iTunes 12.8.2.3 and at least Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) or your Mac will not recognize your iPhone or iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just a case of updating your Mac to the latest version of macOS though. Each time Apple updates the Mac operating system more Macs fall off the list of those supported.

You may also find that you can’t carry out transactions on the internet if you want to pay for things on your out-of-date Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also find that the software you need won’t run on your Mac. Apple and other companies stop supporting older versions of the applications they make, so there could be issues with the versions of the software you are running. If you are experiencing random shutdowns, for example, it could be due to problems with an app you are running – problems that will not be addressed by the developer because that version of the app is no longer supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to run fully supported software then you will need to update to a newer version of macOS – and that may mean that you need to update your Mac. There are workarounds to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672461/how-to-install-macos-on-unsupported-mac.html\">install a new version of macOS on an old Mac</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple supports Macs with operating system updates for approximately eight to ten years, after which time Apple will not support the software and it’s probably a good time to replace your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When do Macs become obsolete?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not just software updates that determine the lifespan of a Mac. It’s also a question of whether it will be possible to fix your Mac should something go wrong with the hardware. Apple has two standards that indicate hardware support is waining: Obsolete or Vintage. The first stage is Vintage: you might be lucky enough to get parts for this Mac, the second is Obsolete: you are out on your own when it comes to any attempt to mend the Mac if it goes wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at Apple’s list of Obsolete Macs – those being the Macs that Apple will no longer provide spare parts for – you will see that the company stops providing parts for Macs that it hasn’t sold for more than seven years. In fact, the company may not even provide parts for Macs that haven’t been sold for more than five years (considered Vintage by the company).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could mean that you won’t be able to get a faulty Mac fixed because the parts aren’t available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Obsolete Macs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Obsolete Macs are generally Macs that Apple stopped selling more than seven years ago. Once a Mac is in Apple’s obsolete list you have little chance of getting it repaired if something does go wrong. You might be able to find spare parts yourself, but Apple won’t provide them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll find more details about the exact models on <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201624\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s dedicated page</a>, but the lists below will give you a general idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple considers the following Macs and older Obsolete, with the 2014 iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) added in the second half of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>11-inch MacBook Air (early 2014 and older) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>12-inch MacBook (2015)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13-inch MacBook Air (early 2014 and older)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2014 and older)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2014 and older)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27-inch iMac (late 2014 and older) – newly added</li>\n\n\n\n<li>21.5-inch iMac (mid 2014 and older) – newly added</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini (2012 and older) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini Server (2012 and older)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro (2010 and older)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anything predating the Intel switch, obviously. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3783678/photoshoot_226-2690_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Old Macs\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Old Macs\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Old Macs\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vintage Macs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also has a list of Vintage Macs. These are Macs that Apple stopped selling between five and seven years ago. (If you live in France where a law means you can get support for spare parts for up to seven years after Apple stops selling a Mac).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Authorized Service Providers will repair vintage products for up to seven years, as long as parts are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple lists the following products as being vintage, with the 2017 iMacs (21.5- and 27-inch), 2014 Mac mini, and the 2019 13-inch and 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro’s added in the second half of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>12-inch MacBook (2016)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13-inch MacBook Air (2015)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13-inch MacBook Pro (2015, 2016, 2017 &amp; 2019)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15-inch MacBook Pro (2015, 2016, 2017 &amp; 2018)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>21.5-inch iMac (2013, 2015 &amp; 2017)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27-inch iMac (2017)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro (2012)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini (2014)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the above, we’d suggest that if your Mac is more than eight years old, it’s time to look for a new one. And, if you see a 2015 or earlier Mac on sale, it’s not sensible to buy it.

If you are lucky enough to get the part an Apple service provider might even be able to fix the Mac for you – but the cost of the work is likely to be prohibitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might find that the Mac was included in part of a recall due to the issue you are experiencing, in that case, it might be worth enlisting in a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/service-programs\" target=\"_blank\">repair program</a>. However, if the time period in which Apple was offering the repairs has passed (which is unfortunately likely) then you will still have to find the money for the repair, which again might be prohibitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple repair programs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s current Mac repair programs include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A recall for 15-inch MacBook Pro units from due to a battery fault 2015-2017</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keyboard services for some Mac laptops bought since 2016</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Service programs that have now ended:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A 13-inch MacBook Pro backlit service program for models from 2016-2018</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A SSD service program for 13in MacBook Pro models from 2017-2018</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A battery replacement program for 13in MacBook Pros from 2016-2017</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have more <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673631/macbook-recalls-and-repair-programs-is-your-mac-included.html\">information about Apple’s product recalls and repair programs here</a>.

We suggest that if your Mac is older than five years then repairing it will not be worth it – unless of course there are important documents or photos on it that you want to retrieve in which case it might be worth looking at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671334/how-to-recover-data-from-damaged-mac-or-external-drive.html\">how to recover these files</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3783678/macbook_air_2019_review_4_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Keyboard\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MacBook Keyboard\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MacBook Keyboard\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I update my Mac or buy a new one?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a similar question to the one above in as much as you will be weighing up whether spending money to improve your Mac might be more savvy than buying a new Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various ways you might be able to improve your existing Mac, including adding more RAM or changing from a hard drive to a SSD. If you can upgrade the components inside your Mac you may be able to speed it up and make it more capable of doing what you need. See <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672495/how-to-upgrade-a-mac.html\">How to upgrade a Mac</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many Macs can’t be upgraded at all. In recent years Apple has taken to soldering RAM in place and hiding components away to make access impossible (or at least impossible if you don’t want to completely destroy your Mac attempting to get to them). With M-series Macs memory, GPU and CPU are all integrated onto the chip, so it is impossible to upgrade them. Nor can you update the SSD as it is soldered onto the motherboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are ways to upgrade your Mac.

Perhaps it will buy you a few more years of use.
