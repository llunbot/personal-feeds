As we have now passed the watershed opening to the transfer market on 1st August, moves can start to be revealed publicly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means teams and riders can finally put us out of our misery and share the news of who’s gone where for 2025, though the rumours will keep on circling until all rosters are filled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the men, Simon Yates and Jai Hindley are among the hottest properties on the transfer market this year. There are also plenty of rumours brewing around riders cutting ties early. On the women’s side, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> champion Demi Vollering is expected to move away from SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike are rumoured to be signing MTB World and Olympics champ Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, and Elisa Longo Borghini is on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\r\n

Alaphilippe has finally settled one of the hottest transfer deals of the year. After confirming his departure from the Belgian team at the Klassikoa at the beginning of August, he has gone on to sign a contract with Swiss team Tudor Pro Cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will end a turbulent decade with the Belgian squad led by Patrick Lefevre. Their relationship soured over the past two years and it became clear earlier in the year that Alaphilippe, a double world champion, would be heading elsewhere. Quickstep boss Patrick Lefevre seemed optimistic about Alaphilippe’s chances of staying with the team, saying, ‘If he chooses with his heart, then I think he will stay with us [Soudal Quickstep]’. The Belgian manager was aware of talks between Tudor and the Frenchman regarding his 2025 contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an announcement given at the beginning of this week, Alaphilippe’s transfer was officially confirmed. Tudor Pro Cycling also disclosed that he will ride under a three-season-long contract. There, Alaphilippe will link up with Marc Hirschi, Michael Storer and Alberto Dainese to hunt UCI WorldTour victories and continue their pursuit to the top division of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I liked the Tudor Pro Cycling project from the beginning,’ Alaphilippe explains. ‘I saw the team arrive and develop, and I also know a few of the riders and staff members. What better way to mark a turning point in my career than with a new and ambitious project?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has also been confirmed that Dane Kasper Asgreen will leave the team along with Jan Hirt who finished inside the top 10 of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia </a>this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Ethan Hayter to Soudal-Quickstep</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"ethan hayter ineos grenadiers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVlzTiKXgAArPsS-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Christian Kaspar-Bartke/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The current British road champion and European champion on the track, Hayter will leave Ineos after a five-and-a-half-year spell at the British team. Hayter’s new destination is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-Quickstep</a>. He will bring the red, white and blue national jersey to the Belgian squad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Londoner is still riding a mix of track and road. He is a solid all-rounder on the road with a particular knack for time-trialling. He is also very competent at rolling profiles and tamer stage races. At Soudal, this should be nurtured well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘From the outside, it has always looked like a great team to be part of,’ Hayter says in the team’s announcement article. ‘This new challenge is something that motivates me for next season’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soudal-Quickstep have also announced the signing of Maximilian Schachmann in recent weeks as well as Pascal Eenkhoorn. Schachmann, a two-time winner of Paris-Nice, will return to the team he started his pro career. For Eenkhoorn, this will mark the end of a short stint at Lotto-dstny.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Riejanne Markus signs to Lidl-Trek</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-970x647.png\" alt=\"riejanne markus\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T140844.419.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>29-year-old Riejanne Markus has announced that she will leave <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Team Visma-Lease a Bike</a> for Lidl-Trek.

The Swiss team headed by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/fabian-cancellara-on-life-in-retirement-i-m-busier-now-than-when-i-raced\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Cancellara</a> has been growing in the past few seasons. As shown by making their Grand Tour debut at the Giro this year, the squad has been rising through the ranks courtesy of some big-name transfers such as Alberto Dainese, Arvid de Kleijn, Michael Storer and Matteo Trentin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hirschi will lead the squad’s Classics line-up in the years to come. Tudor have secured some top-tier race invites including Paris-Nice and Tirenno-Adriatico. The Swiss team is not far off from a promotion to the UCI WorldTour in the next five years. With all-stars like Hirschi, they could garner more attention and wildcard invitations to achieve this goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transfer brings to an end Hirschi’s four-year-long partnership with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>.

With this, it has been confirmed that Alberto Bettiol has received a strong offer from Astana Qazaqstan, soon to be rebranded to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/chinese-company-invests-in-astana-qazaqstan\" target=\"_blank\">XDS following the change of sponsors</a>. <em>Gazzetta Dello Sport</em> correctly reported that Bettiol would move as soon as mid-August 2024. This means he is now contracted with Astana until 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasons for this transfer seem unknown. Bettiol has been with EF on and off since the beginning of his career. He has been given leadership roles and a chance to flourish in one-day races and stage races alike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Italian jersey on his back, Astana will be glad to welcome back the <em>tricolore </em>jersey. Astana are in desperate need of some UCI points. The squad look poised for relegation if they don’t improve on their results in the next year.

They are close to the relegation zone and need to change their strategy after a lacklustre season. In the quest for UCI points, the French team have enlisted Spanish sprinter Alex Aranburu and German climber Emanuel Buchmann.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aranburu’s departure from Movistar was widely reported. While at Movistar over the past three seasons, Aranburu’s results have been mixed. With this deal secured with Cofidis, Aranburu will become a core rider in the team. The Spanish rider is a great signing for gathering UCI points. Aranburu can get over small climbs and he can time-trial well. If he’s used wisely next year, he could save Cofidis’ WorldTour licence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emu Buchmann is another solid signing. Cofidis have relied upon Guillaume Martin and Ion Izaguirre. With Buchmann, a former top five finisher at the Tour de France, the team have another card to play. Buchmann’s departure comes after being left out of Bora’s Grand Tour squads.

Simon will have the opportunity to go for his own results with us, but he will also be a valuable asset for the team in the mountains.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After ten years spent at Jayco-AlUla, this will mark the end of one of cycling’s longest-running partnerships, which saw Yates claim a Vuelta a España victory and a Giro d’Italia podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Yates gone, Jayco-AlUla have announced that they will bring in Perth-born Ben O’Connor. High in confidence from a fourth-place finish at the Giro in May, O’Connor will lead Jayco-AlUla’s Tour de France hopes for at least the next two seasons.

The team will evolve into a Chinese-Kazakh squad with a roster that might include the current Italian champion Alberto Bettiol.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: Demi Vollering and Elisa Longo Borghini expecting moves</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-970x647.png\" alt=\"demi vollering tour de france femmes 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T155708.331.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of the top riders in women’s cycling look set for big transfers at the end of this season. Neither has been confirmed yet, but strong rumours are circling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A staple of Lidl-Trek’s success in the women’s peloton, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-longo-borghini-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Elisa Longo Borghini</a> is set to leave the American squad at the end of 2024. This will see the end of a five-year-long stint with the team that has carried her to Paris-Roubaix and Ronde van Vlaanderen glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italian’s departure was confirmed after the Vuelta Femenina by Lidl-Trek team manager Luca Guercilena in Italian newspaper <em>Gazzetta Dello Sport</em>. Guercilena also confirmed that Lidl-Trek tried to extend the contract of the Italian national champion, but she has decided that her future lies elsewhere.The destination has emerged to be UAE Team ADQ, although, this news awaits official confirmation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March, news broke that Demi Vollering will be leaving SD Worx-Protime at the end of 2024. After a partnership that has resulted in Classics victories and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\" target=\"_blank\">a Tour de France Femmes</a> title, the Dutch champion will go elsewhere for 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s perhaps not a surprise given the increasing powers of Lotte Kopecky and return of Anna van der Breggen next season, Vollering is the biggest name in the women’s market this year and there is a fierce and exclusive battle for her signature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources disclose that Vollering’s agent was in serious talks with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> up until the Tour of Flanders when the American team pulled back their interest in support of their current roster’s future objectives. FDJ-Suez remain a strong contender, but the viability of this rumour is up in the air as the team lays eyes on other objectives. Elsewhere, UAE Team ADQ have fallen out of the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: Tom Pidcock could leave Ineos</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tom pidcock ineos grenadiers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin/Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">a gold medal in the men’s cross-country event at the Paris 2024 Olympics</a>, it is rumoured that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock </a>will leave<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\"> Ineos Grenadiers</a>. Reports state that Pidcock is looking to cut his deal with Ineos Grenadiers early and that he ‘could be on the transfer market in a matter of weeks’ according to <a href=\"https://dnlbenson.substack.com/p/transfers\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Benson</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is rumoured that two teams are in the running for Pidcock: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe is a natural match. The team has hosted mountain bikers before, including Victor Koretzky who won the silver medal in Paris. Pidcock is also already a Red Bull UK athlete and works closely with the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lidl-Trek have received a big budget increase too, plus Trek already have a mountain bike team and the squad have added more multi-discipline riders over the past two seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rumours come alongside Pauline Ferrand-Prévot’s Ineos departure. The women’s cross-country World and Olympic champion will reportedly move to Visma-Lease a Bike to return to road racing, with her sights set on the Tour de France. With her exit, Ineos’s women’s project looks to be coming to an end.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other men’s rumours and confirmations</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-970x647.png\" alt=\"finn fisher black\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-22T161943.132.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of rumours awaiting confirmation within the men’s peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remco Evenepoel’s current domestiques Fausto Masnada and Jan Hirt are reported to be on the move for 2025. The former, a podium finisher at Il Lombardia, will move to the Swiss-South African Continental squad Q36.5, while Hirt, a top ten finisher at the Giro on two occasions, will head to Israel-Premier Tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of confirmations, Laurence Pithie and Finn Fisher-Black bring two Kiwis into Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Simon Carr has signed for Cofidis from EF.
