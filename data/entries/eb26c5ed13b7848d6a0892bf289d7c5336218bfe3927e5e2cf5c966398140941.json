That’s why I’m particularly excited about today’s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> announcement that <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\">Amazon Q Developer</a> is now available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/canvas/\">Amazon SageMaker Canvas</a>. What catches my attention is how Amazon Q Developer helps connect ML expertise with business needs, making ML more accessible across organizations.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\">Amazon Q Developer</a> helps domain experts build accurate, production-quality ML models through natural language interactions, even if they don’t have ML expertise. Amazon Q Developer guides these users by breaking down their business problems and analyzing their data to recommend step-by-step guidance for building custom ML models. It transforms users’ data to remove anomalies, and builds and evaluates custom ML models to recommend the best one, while providing users control and visibility into every step of the guided ML workflow. This empowers organizations to innovate faster with reduced time to market. It also reduces their reliance on ML experts so their specialists can focus on more complex technical challenges.</p> \n<p>For example, a marketing analyst can state, “I want to predict home sales prices using home characteristics and past sales data”, and Amazon Q Developer will translate this into a set of ML steps, analyzing relevant customer data, building multiple models, and recommending the best approach.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Let’s see it in action</strong></span><br /> To start using Amazon Q Developer, I follow the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-getting-started.html\">Getting started with using Amazon SageMaker Canvas</a> guide to launch the Canvas application. In this demo, I use natural language instructions to create a model to predict house prices for marketing and finance teams. From the SageMaker Canvas page, I select <strong>Amazon Q</strong> and then choose <strong>Start a new conversation.</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/21/Screenshot-2024-11-21-at-2.02.00 PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/21/Screenshot-2024-11-21-at-2.02.00 PM.png\" width=\"688\" height=\"332\" /></a></p> \n<p>In the new conversation I write:</p> \n<p><strong><em>I am an analyst and need to predict house prices for my marketing and finance teams.</em></strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/27/AmazonQ-CanvasPDP-1127.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/27/AmazonQ-CanvasPDP-1127.jpg\" width=\"824\" height=\"813\" /></a></p> \n<p>Next, Amazon Q Developer explains the problem and recommends the appropriate ML model type. It also outlines the solution requirements, including the necessary dataset characteristics. Amazon Q Developer then asks if <strong>I want to upload my dataset</strong> or<strong> I want to choose a target column</strong>. I select it to upload my dataset.</p> \n<p>In the next step, Amazon Q Developer lists the dataset requirements, which include relevant information about houses, current house prices, and the target variable for the regression model. It then recommended next steps, including: <strong>I want to upload my dataset</strong>, <strong>Select an existing dataset</strong>, <strong>Create a new dataset</strong> or <strong>I want to choose a target column</strong>. For this demo, I’ll use the <strong>canvas-sample-housing.csv</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-sample-datasets.html\">sample dataset</a> as my existing dataset.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/select_an_existing_dataset.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/select_an_existing_dataset-922x1024.png\" alt=\"select_an_existing_dataset\" width=\"922\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p>After selecting and loading the dataset, Amazon Q Developer analyzes it and suggests <strong>median_house_value</strong> as the target column for the regression model. I accept by selecting <strong>I would like to predict the “median_house_value” column.</strong> Moving on to the next step, Amazon Q Developer details which dataset features (such as “location”, “housing_median_age”, and “total_rooms”) it will use to predict the median_house_value.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/artifacts/AWSNews/2024/AWSNEWS-1199-upload-dataset.gif\" width=\"864\" height=\"864\" /></p> \n<p>Before moving forward with model training, I ask about the data quality, because without good data we can’t build a reliable model. Amazon Q Developer responds with quality insights for my entire dataset.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/quality.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/quality-1024x967.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"967\" /></a></p> \n<p>I can ask specific questions about individual features and their distributions to better understand the data quality.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-7.01.49 PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-7.01.49 PM-866x1024.png\" alt=\"columns in dataset\" width=\"866\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p>To my surprise, through the previous question, I discovered that the “households” column has a wide variation between extreme values, which could affect the model’s prediction accuracy. Therefore, I ask Amazon Q Developer to fix this outlier problem.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-6.39.42 PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-6.39.42 PM-885x1024.png\" width=\"885\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p>After the transformation is done, I can ask what steps Amazon Q Developer followed to make this change. Behind the scenes, Amazon Q Developer applies advanced data preparation steps using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-data-export.html\">SageMaker Canvas data preparation capabilities</a>, which I can review and see the steps so that I can visualize and replicate the process to get the final, prepared dataset for training the model.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/artifacts/AWSNews/2024/AWSNEWS-1199-data.gif\" width=\"1090\" height=\"652\" /></p> \n<p>After reviewing the data preparation steps, I select <strong>Launch my training job</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-7.05.21 PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-7.05.21 PM-1024x765.png\" alt=\"launch training job\" width=\"1024\" height=\"765\" /></a></p> \n<p>After the training job is launched, I can see its progress in the conversation, and the datasets created.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/21/Screenshot-2024-11-21-at-11.30.20 AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/21/Screenshot-2024-11-21-at-11.30.20 AM.png\" width=\"706\" height=\"822\" /></a></p> \n<p>As a data scientist, I particularly appreciate that, with Amazon Q Developer, Ican see detailed metrics such as the confusion matrix and precision-recall scores for classification models and root mean square error (RMSE) for regression models. These are crucial elements I always look for when evaluating model performance and making data-driven decisions, and it’s refreshing to see them presented in a way that’s accessible to nontechnical users to build trust and enable proper governance while maintaining the depth that technical teams need.</p> \n<p>You can access these metrics by selecting the new model from <strong>My Models</strong> or from the <strong>Amazon Q </strong>conversation menu:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Overview – </strong>This tab shows the <strong>Column impact</strong> analysis.
