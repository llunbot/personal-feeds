I9 stuck with J-bend steel spokes for these wheels, ensuring inexpensive maintenance and convenient spoke replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intended for XC/Trail riding, the SOLiX Trail S wheels come with 29” rims only, and offer all the usual axle fitment options for MTBs. As you’d expect from I9, there are a dozen hub colors you can choose from!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SOLiX Trail S Aluminum Wheels:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheel-side.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheel-side.webp\" alt=\"Industry Nine SOLiX Trail S wheel, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheel-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheel-side-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheel-side-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheel-side-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SOLiX Trail S wheelset is designed to offer a speedy, high-performance ride while remaining tough and reliable. If you were wondering, the “S” in Trail S stands for steel, as I9 went with J-bend steel spokes for these wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These wheels are available in 29” only, and the rims are ideal for 2.2-2.5” tire widths. If I even need to say it, they are of course, tubeless compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SOLiX Trail S wheelset rolls on I9’s premium alloy rims, featuring their proprietary profile that’s designed to resist dents. The rims’ inner width is 27mm, and the outer width is 31mm. As a nice finishing touch, the rims get weatherproof sublimated graphics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complete SOLiX Trail S wheelset weighs in at 1680g. The front wheel alone is 790g, while the rear is 890g. Each rim weighs 455g on its own. Larger riders may need to note that these wheels do carry a rider (+gear) weight limit of 245lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub.webp\" alt=\"Industry Nine SOLiX Trail S wheelset, hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-hub-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Central to this wheelset is Industry Nine’s SOLiX hub. These hubs feature a 5-pawl freehub body that offers near-instant 0.59° engagement. The SOLiX hubs feature J-bend flanges with 28 spokes front and rear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels are available in standard spacings for MTBs (15×110/12×148), but rear 12x157mm MTB hubs are also available as a custom option. Other fitment options include QRx141 rear axle endcaps, XD, MS, or HG cassette drivers, and standard or RockShox Torque caps for front wheels. As for rotor mounting, SOLiX hubs only come with Center Lock brake rotor interfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the SOLiX wheels are only sold with black rims, the hubs are available in 12 different colors. Check out Industry Nine’s website for all the options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Purchase Options:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-pair.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-pair.webp\" alt=\"Industry Nine SOLiX Trail S wheelset, pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-pair.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-pair-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-pair-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Industry-Nine-SOLiX-Trail-S-wheels-pair-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Images c.

The front wheel alone sells for $365, and the rear wheel costs $590 (all prices not including custom options).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the axle and cassette options listed above all come at no extra charge, there is one major upgrade available for these wheels. You can outfit your SOLiX Trail S wheelset with ceramic bearings (vs. standard steel bearings) for an additional $580!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black wheels with standard hub spacings will ship out in just two days. Custom wheelsets ship within two weeks. Industry Nine’s wheels are hand-made in Asheville, North Carolina. I9 covers the SOLiX Trail S wheels with a two-year warranty against defects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://industrynine.com/wheels/mountain/solix-trail-s\">industrynine.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/industry-nine-solix-trail-s-aluminum-wheelset/\">Industry Nine’s SOLiX Trail S Aluminum Wheelset Runs J-Bend Spokes to Balance Performance and Price</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"dc91087c52ae41f032f11f4a8c02f8c8327982bc2ec0e440cc3906fb612428b6","category":"Cycling"}
