That means that although the car can accelerate, brake, and steer for itself, a human driver is still required to maintain situational awareness.</p>\n<p>The new system is true automated driving as opposed to driver assistance. It uses a combination of radar, cameras, lidar, microphones (to detect emergency vehicles), and a moisture sensor, plus the car's high-accuracy GNSS, which locates the car on an HD map.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819560#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819560&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
