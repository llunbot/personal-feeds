This design means the system can attach at numerous points to hold any type of bike.</p>\n<p>That means anything from featherweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-under-3000/\">road bikes</a> all the way up to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">best electric bikes</a>. The Epos can even accept bikes with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> or pannier racks, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>Bikes can be attached either by a frame tube or on the rear wheel. Thule claims the arms are safe to use with carbon frame tubes and wheels.</p>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar, Thule explained the wraparound nature of the Epos’ strap-based clamping system makes it more carbon-friendly than other towbar carriers, although it stressed that no carrier is ever fully carbon-friendly. This is because the wall thicknesses of carbon frames vary.</p>\n<p>Thule also says you can use its Carbon Frame Protector adaptor if you want to be as cautious as possible.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> As with any other towbar rack, you’ll need to display your number plate in some territories.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thule</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike’s wheels sit in recessed channels to keep it upright.</p>\n<p>The Epos is rated for bikes up to 30kg each. Thule says it will accommodate frame tubes between 20 and 90mm in diameter and wheelbases up to 1,350mm. The Epos can accept from 16in to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in wheels</a> and tyres up to a 3.2in width.</p>\n<h2>Easy storage</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Epos folds down when not in use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thule</i></span></div>\n<p>Thule is using a Smart Tilting Mechanism so you can access the boot with the rack attached.</p>\n<p>We asked Thule for further details and it said the tilt mechanism is designed to offer more clearance than previous models, meaning vehicles that had trouble clearing older tilting racks should clear the Epos.</p>\n<p>When the rack isn’t in use, the bike arms stow flat. Thule says this makes the boot accessible without tilting the carrier.</p>\n<p>The rack is also fully foldable for easy transportation and storage when not in use.</p>\n<h2>Accessories to boot</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/ThuleEposBikeRepairHolder-46f37a1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Thule Bike Repair Holder against a white background\" title=\"Thule Bike Repair Holder against a white background\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Bike Repair Holder might save the need to take a portable workstand on trips.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Thule</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/ThuleEposFoldableLoadingRamp01-ed32435.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Thule Foldable Loading Ramp\" title=\"Thule Foldable Loading Ramp\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Thule offers a Foldable Loading Ramp too if you’re working with heavier bikes. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Thule</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/ThuleEposFoldableLoadingRamp02-02501a7.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Thule Foldable Loading Ramp\" title=\"Thule Foldable Loading Ramp\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The ramp in its folded state. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Thule</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/ThuleHighGradeLock-9405376.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Thule High Grade Lock\" title=\"Thule High Grade Lock\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Finally, Thule offers a High Grade Lock. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Thule</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Epos is compatible with a range of Thule’s accessories, including an Epos-specific Bike Repair Holder.
