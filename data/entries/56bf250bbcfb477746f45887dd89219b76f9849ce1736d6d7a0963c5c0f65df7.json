But WSL, handy as it is, has been hobbled by several things it could <em>not</em> do. Installing WSL has never been as easy as it should—and getting graphical apps to work has historically been <em>possible</em> but a pain in the butt which required some fairly obscure third-party software.</p>\n<p>Windows 11 finally fixes both of those problems. The Windows Subsystem for Linux isn't <em>perfect</em> on Windows 11—but it's a huge improvement over what came before.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801283#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801283&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56bf250bbcfb477746f45887dd89219b76f9849ce1736d6d7a0963c5c0f65df7","category":"Tech"}
