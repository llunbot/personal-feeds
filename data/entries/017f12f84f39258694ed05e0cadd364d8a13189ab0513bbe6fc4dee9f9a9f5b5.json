The standard terminal, designed for residential and small business customers, is expected to cost Amazon less than $400 to make; Amazon did not say what it will charge customers for the terminals or for monthly service plans.</p>\n<p>The \"standard customer terminal measures less than 11 inches square and 1 inch thick,\" Amazon said. \"It weighs less than five pounds without its mounting bracket. Despite this modest footprint, the device will be one of the most powerful commercially available customer terminals of its size, delivering speeds up to 400 megabits per second (Mbps). Amazon expects to produce these terminals for less than $400 each.\"</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/amazon-standard-terminal-980x552.jpeg\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Amazon's standard terminal for residential and small-business customers.

Amazon didn't differentiate between download and upload speeds in its announcement, but upload speeds are likely to be slower than downloads.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923953#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923953&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"017f12f84f39258694ed05e0cadd364d8a13189ab0513bbe6fc4dee9f9a9f5b5","category":"Tech"}
