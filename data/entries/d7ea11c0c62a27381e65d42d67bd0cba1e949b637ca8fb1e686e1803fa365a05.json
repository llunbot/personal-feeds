{"title":"If you own a 16-inch MacBook Pro, your power adapter just got its first-ever update","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2165463/16-inch-macbook-pro-140w-power-adapter-firmware-update.html","date":1701963645000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple is expected to launch a slew of software updates next week, including <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2117707/ios-17-2-beta-is-out-now-and-includes-the-journal-app.html\">iOS 17.2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2117732/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-2-beta.html\">macOS 14.2</a>, a few smaller firmware updates already arrived this week. As we previously reported, there’s another <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2163431/apple-2nd-gen-airpods-pro-firmware-updates-ios-17.html\">AirPods Pro firmware update</a>—bringing the total this fall to five—and now there’s a rare update to the 140-watt power adapter that ships with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you ask, no, we have no idea what it does. But we do know it brings the version number to 1.4.73 and the build number to 10M5237. Apple doesn’t document this kind of firmware update with release notes so we don’t know what bug fixes or features it brings, but according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1732163640533332233&amp;xcust=1-1-2165463-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Aaron613 on X</a>, who tracks software and firmware updates, it’s the first time Apple has updated the 140-watt charger since it debuted alongside the 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple ships all 16-inch MacBook Pros with the 140-watt power adapter, which is needed for fast charging along with the supplied USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable. On the newest M3 models, fast charging is also available with <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2165463-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m\">Apple’s 240W USB-C Charge Cable</a>, so the update may be related to that new functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no way to force your charger to update. The power adapter will update when plugged in and attached to your MacBook, but there’s no guarantee it will do it today. To check your firmware version, go to the <em>General</em> tab in <em>System Settings</em>, then click <em>About</em> and scroll down to <em>System Report</em>. Then click the <em>Power</em> tab and scroll down to <em>AC Charger Information</em>.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d7ea11c0c62a27381e65d42d67bd0cba1e949b637ca8fb1e686e1803fa365a05","category":"Apple"}
