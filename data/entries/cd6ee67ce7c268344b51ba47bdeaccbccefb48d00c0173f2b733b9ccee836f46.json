Sand dunes to drag my bike through, sparse villages, carefully planned water re-supply points, and endless Mongolian steppe in every direction. Just looking to the east from some of the mountain passes I’ve been on and seeing the empty terrain fade into the distance was a little unnerving, but at the same time, exciting.</p>\n<p>I was hoping that heading east would reduce my chance of encountering the notorious headwind that often plagues western travel in this part of the country, but if I’ve learned anything here it’s that you cannot outsmart Mongolian winds. From day one it was apparent that this wouldn’t be the case when I was crawling along the plateau at a very gradual incline, with my three-inch tires sinking into the soft sand, and getting blasted by a face full of wind. I looked down at my map to see the minuscule progress I’d made into the daunting route and wondered if this was such a great idea.</p>\n<p>Some rather threatening storm clouds were brewing all around me, and the day was getting long, so I took shelter in a strategically placed cluster of dirt mounds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" width=\"405\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" width=\"403\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The sky let out a burst of rain that lasted only a few minutes just as I got my tent set up, and when I unzipped the tent to survey the surroundings, I was treated to one of the more spectacular sunsets I’ve ever seen along with a herd of camels grazing just a little ways away from my campsite. They shot me camel looks that seemed to say “wtf are you doing here?!” all the while appearing to be way more intrigued by my presence than by the combo double-rainbow sunset that was so captivating to me.</p>\n<p>I woke up early in the night in my tent with an all-too-familiar feeling. Apparently, the mysterious canned dinner I’d consumed the night before and my insides were going to war, and I was losing that battle. Every forty-five minutes or so I’d wake up to the nauseous feeling of that unfortunate meal traveling the wrong direction, scramble away from my tent, and then crawl back.</p>\n<p>Restaurants are sparse in rural Mongolia to begin with, but along this route there are basically none, so I was typically cooking up my usual stir-fried take on instant noodles with whatever vegetables I could find, but this time I’d gotten a little experimental with the canned rice and meat concoction from the market in Khovd and it came back to bite me.</p>\n<p>In the morning I was feeling like I got run over by a truck, but with no water resupply around, I knew I still had to get on the bike and press on to the next village on the map, which was about 50 km of soft washboard away. I put my head down and put on some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXgzc--MgvA\" target=\"_blank\">Yat-Kha</a> in my headphones and gave everything I had left just to make it to town.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?fit=2000,9999&amp;quality=75\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1328\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?w=2475&amp;quality=75 2475w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=1024,680&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=2000,1328&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=768,510&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=1800,1195&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=1335,886&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=700,465&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=1536,1020&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-10-e1693004913259.jpg?resize=2048,1360&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>I had a feeling this was going to be a very small village based on what I could see on my map, but the luck I didn’t have with last night’s dinner was with me this time. A local woman informed me that there was a single small hotel in town for me to crash at for a couple of days to recover before I’d once again face the desolate steppe.</p>\n<p>A couple of days passed, and I still wasn’t feeling 100%, but I was good enough to get moving. Here, my days were dictated by water re-supply points, which were conveniently spaced to find about one per day, but that would usually mean I’d have a pretty sizable minimum distance I could travel for the day if I wanted to reach water again by the evening. I couldn’t afford to have a bad day and only make it halfway.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-13.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>There’s something incredibly satisfying and reassuring about riding out in the desert all day and falling asleep to the sound of a river flowing just outside your tent.

At times the sandy track I was following would disappear entirely and I would be left to follow the tracks of random camel hooves, which seemed to vaguely be heading for the part of the ridge-line in the distance where my GPS was telling me a track would cross the hills.</p>\n<p>The wide-open expanse was growing all around me. I could just barely make out herds of animals through the heat mirage that stretched across the horizon. It was the closest I’d felt to a place like the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/once-upon-a-time-in-the-bolivian-west-ryan-wilson/\">since I was there in 2017</a>, except the soft and slightly-inclined terrain here was much more of a slow drag to cross when compared to the hard salt flat.

Picking up another’s trail made me feel more confident that I was heading the right way.</p>\n<p>In the distance, I spotted a small yurt camp, the first I’d seen in a long while. Usually, camps are set up near some sort of water supply, but this one was way out in the middle of nowhere, with no signs of rivers anywhere around.

I stopped in town to find that all of the shops were locked up by about 6 p.m., so I made my way just outside of town to set up camp for the night and try again in the morning before hitting the road to Erdenekhairkhan.

On my route notes, there was a spot that would require walking through sand to reach a water source for about five kilometers each way, that I was somewhat dreading. I didn’t like the idea of leaving my bike alone in the middle of nowhere for a couple of hours while I went to haul water, but I certainly didn’t want to drag it through the sand either.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-46.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>When I arrived to the point where I’d have to start the walk there was one yurt camp nearby and the sound of a radio playing from inside, so I decided I’d go and ask if I could leave my bike at his place while I trekked out to the river.

I knew this was coming, so I probably made it out to be something grandiose and brutal in my head beforehand, but when I got there it was just a couple of hours of pushing the bike, slow and steady.</p>\n<p>The relief of having the dunes behind me was short-lived as I found myself at the bottom of a sizable climb with a solid four-kilometer section in the middle that averages over a 14% gradient. That’s a tough climb if you’ve got fresh legs and a 25-pound bike, but something else entirely with days of riding in your legs and your whole life strapped to your bike, not to mention a few days of supplies.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-55.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Thankfully, those tough climbs always seem to pay off with incredible views around here, and this was one of the best yet, seeing the plateau splayed out beneath me as I pedaled toward the summit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-56.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>This was no ordinary mountain pass summit though.

While I was loving the roads and views in this section of the particularly desolate Mongolian countryside, I also found myself starting to daydream of having a nice day or two off in a town somewhere with a bed and a hot shower. Spurred on by the thought of creature comforts, I hightailed it as fast as I could toward the nearby town of Uliastai, by far the biggest I’d seen since I left Khovd well over a week ago. Uliastai was a small town by normal standards, but a metropolis on the Mongolian steppe, and it was a perfect place to rest up for a couple of days before I’d head out on my last stretch of riding in Mongolia, to the northern Khövsgöl region near the border with Russia.</p>\n<p><em>Here’s the route I took for this stretch, for additional route info check the “Central Route” at <a href=\"http://bikepackground.com/packground-en/mongoliatrails.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brigitte and Ivo’s site</a></em>:<span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bikepacking-mongolia-zavkhan-steppe/\">Ryan Wilson Crosses Mongolia’s Desolate Zavkhan Steppe</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Ryan Wilson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"cd6ee67ce7c268344b51ba47bdeaccbccefb48d00c0173f2b733b9ccee836f46","category":"Cycling"}
