It had to be a Pinarello Dogma. You take the plunge and even get it through Pinarello’s MyWay service to get a customised paintjob. The bike arrives and it’s perfect; naturally you want to take it for a spin and show it off as soon as possible. Unfortunately you live in the UK, so every time you roll out from your house your precious Dogma is at the mercy of the British weather and what it leaves on the roads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes perfect sense then that Pinarello in the UK has joined forces with innovative bike maintenance and cleaning specialist Gtechniq, with every Pinarello Dogma MyWay frame now coming coated in Gtechniq’s renowned Bike Ceramic protection and Pinarello’s UK stores stocking Gtechniq’s full  range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is Gtechniq and what is Bike Ceramic?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-970x546.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-970x546.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-300x169.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-768x432.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-1536x864.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-750x422.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO13-1140x641.png 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the uninitiated, Gtechniq is a Northamptonshire-based company founded in Hong Kong in 2001 by quantum physicist Dr Drew Gill and has been creating paint protection and cleaning products for cars and boats ever since. The company branched out into cycling in 2021 with the star of the range: Bike Ceramic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike Ceramic is a scientifically formulated coating that bonds to the bike frame’s surface, forming a layer around the fragile and exposed paintwork that stops mud, dirt, grime etc from sticking to the surface. Bike Ceramic is a premium product at £55, but as it’s dirt-repellent, what muck that does stick to the bike is incredibly easy to remove, meaning it saves on both cleaning and maintenance. So if you’re forking out on a bike like a Pinarello Dogma, it’s probably something you’d want to invest in anyway, right?</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pinarello-dogma-x-review\">Pinarello Dogma X review: First ride on Pinarello’s new top-tier endurance bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gtechniq-clean-cut\">Gtechniq: Clean cut</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pinarello-dogma-f-disc-review\">Pinarello Dogma F Disc review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in it for Pinarello?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-970x546.png\" alt=\"Pinarello workshop\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-970x546.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-300x169.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-768x432.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-1536x864.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-750x422.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Gtechniq-PINARELLO11-1140x641.png 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We offer probably the most colours of any bicycle brand, primarily there are eight to ten colours but our real claim is our MyWay product, where customers can select from a huge palate of decals, colours and graphics. It gives a Dogma customer something unique to them,’ says Richard Hemington, managing director of Pinarello UK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A Dogma bicycle or frame is a big investment for a customer, so they need protecting and looking after. Gtechniq came about because we found it works excellently with the finishes we offer – we have matt and gloss finishes but it’s quite difficult to protect a matt finish. Gtechniq’s ceramic coating works perfectly so the matt paint almost works like a gloss paint. From my own experience riding in Dorset where it’s typically filthy, the bike is super-easy to clean it just comes off, dirt doesn’t stay on even during the ride, it’s amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We believe associating Gtechniq with our MyWay product is the best thing, a customer is investing £1,100 more on a frame because it’s their own, so of course we’d like to protect it and we’re happy to do that when they purchase their frame.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The partnership is a two-way street of course, and for Gtechniq to partner with a brand and a bike like Pinarello and the Dogma was a no brainer. Given the company has only been protecting bike frames for three years it shows how effective the product truly is. And although Pinarello has Italian heritage, there’s no doubting its standing in British cycling culture after more than a decade with Team Sky and Ineos Grenadiers. While Gtechniq Bike Ceramic would benefit even those riding on continental Europe’s most pristine roads in glorious sunshine, it’s essential for those subjecting their superbikes to the dirt-laden lanes of the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get your Gtechniq-protected Pinarello Dogma, visit <a href=\"https://pinarello.com/global/en/myway\" target=\"_blank\">pinarello.com</a>.
