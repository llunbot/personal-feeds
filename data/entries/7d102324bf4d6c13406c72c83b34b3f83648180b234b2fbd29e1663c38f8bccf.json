{"title":"iOS 18.2 Beta 3 Adds New ‘Require Screen On’ Toggle for Camera Control","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/11/ios-18-2-beta-3-camera-control-toggle/","date":1731429464000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/11/ios-18-2-beta-3-now-available-to-developers/\">iOS 18.2 beta 3</a> adds another new toggle for\npersonalizing the iPhone 16’s Camera Control. Now, you can open\nthe Camera app with a single press of the Camera Control even if\nyour display is off.</p>\n\n<p>If your iPhone 16’s display is off, the default behavior is that\nyou press the Camera Control once to wake the screen and again to\nopen the Camera app. This new toggle in iOS 18 gives you the\nability to remove that first press.</p>\n\n<p>If you go to the Settings app and choose “Display and Brightness,”\nyou’ll see a new “Require Screen On” toggle at the bottom. This\ntoggle is enabled by default. If you <em>disable</em> this toggle,\nhowever, a single press of the Camera Control will automatically\nopen the Camera app regardless of whether or not your iPhone 16’s\nscreen is on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was a significant gripe of mine in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_iphones_16\">my iPhones 16 review</a>, and this new setting is exactly what I was hoping for from Apple. I even agree that it’s probably a good idea for the “Require Screen On” setting to be on by default. I’m already running the iOS 18.2 betas on my personal phone for Apple Intelligence features, so I’ve disabled this new option already. I’m curious if it will result in any inadvertent Camera app launches, but I don’t think it will, for me. If anything, after two months of daily use of an iPhone 16 Pro, I feel like the recessed inset of the Camera Control button makes it a little too hard to click. I sort of wish it were raised, more like the Action and Side buttons. That Camera Control is effectively flush with the sides of the iPhone is protection enough — again, for me at least — against accidental presses.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/12/ios-18-beta-require-screen-on-for-camera-control\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7d102324bf4d6c13406c72c83b34b3f83648180b234b2fbd29e1663c38f8bccf","category":"Tech"}
