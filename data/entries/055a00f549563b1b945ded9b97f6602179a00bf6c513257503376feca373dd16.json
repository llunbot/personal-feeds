The move comes after plagiarism allegations from major media outlets, including <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/06/07/buzzy-ai-search-engine-perplexity-is-directly-ripping-off-content-from-news-outlets/\">Forbes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-plagiarized-our-story-about-how-perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/\">Wired</a>, and Ars parent company <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/cond-nast-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-ai-search-engine-perplexity\">Condé Nast</a>. Perplexity, valued at over $1 billion, aims to compete with search giant Google.</p>\n\n<p>\"To further support the vital work of media organizations and online creators, we need to ensure publishers can thrive as Perplexity grows,\" writes the company in a <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-the-perplexity-publishers-program\">blog post</a> announcing the problem. \"That’s why we’re excited to announce the Perplexity Publishers Program and our first batch of partners: TIME, Der Spiegel, Fortune, Entrepreneur, The Texas Tribune, and WordPress.com.\"</p>\n<p>Under the program, Perplexity will share a percentage of ad revenue with publishers when their content is cited in AI-generated answers. The revenue share applies on a per-article basis and potentially multiplies if articles from a single publisher are used in one response. Some content providers, such as WordPress.com, plan to pass some of that revenue on to content creators.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039978#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039978&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"055a00f549563b1b945ded9b97f6602179a00bf6c513257503376feca373dd16","category":"Tech"}
