The comments came in response to a question of whether the company has a \"moral obligation\" to give back to the taxpayers who helped develop the life-saving immunization—presumably by not dramatically hiking the vaccine's price as it moves from federal distribution to the commercial market this year.</p>\n<p>While the government most recently paid $26 per dose for Moderna's updated booster dose, the company is planning to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/moderna-may-match-pfizers-400-price-hike-on-covid-vaccines-report-says/\">raise the price of its shots to $110 to $130 per dose</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922447#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922447&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73a5d7fcd705f61aa4e06be4c01c75ad1f5ee31def068acb30576fadfd0b2950","category":"Tech"}
