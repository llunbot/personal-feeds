It was day 8 of The Amazing Chase. Now, all that remains is a final push to Paris. Even better, he’s thoroughly journaled the experience via The Amazing Chase <a href=\"https://jackultracyclist.com/theamazingchase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://jackultracyclist.com/theamazingchase\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">website</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRUQM5CMsFi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRUQM5CMsFi/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Instagram</a>.</p><p>Not bad for a kid who spent time in drug rehab.</p><h2>Yellow Jersey Dreams</h2><p>Thompson says the Tour de France has inspired him since his early days.</p><p>“As a cyclist, I’ve always been fascinated by the Tour de France,” he says in the teaser to his upcoming film. “As a young child, my goal was always to wear the yellow jersey and ride down the Champs Elysees in front of a crowd of people as the first placed rider.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/713Qh38flro\" width=\"867\" height=\"488\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>“The reality is that my cycling journey has been anything but normal.” Partying and substance abuse issues bucked Thompson off the racing path during his early 20’s. But, after rehab work, he reinvented himself as a cyclist. This year, he revived his Tour de France dreams with The Amazing Chase.</p><p>“I still have a dream and like the young boy that once watched the Tour with big open eyes late into the night,” he says. In finishing the Chase ahead of the peloton, he wants to “highlight what is possible with the right mindset and determination.”</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47.jpg\" alt=\"jack ultra cyclist the amazing chase\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb25 src ng ngcb25 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14152531/JackUltraCyclist_TheAmazingChase_Day7_47-630x420.jpg 630w\"></p><h2>Living the Dream: The Amazing Chase</h2><p>To finish ahead of the field at the Tour, Thompson would have to make it personal. “How fast can it actually be ridden?” The Amazing Chase’s website proposes.</p><p>Thompson resolved to ride 2 stages per day for 10 days straight.
