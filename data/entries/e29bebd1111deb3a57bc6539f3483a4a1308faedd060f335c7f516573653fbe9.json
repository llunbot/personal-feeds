I’m not trying to trigger you by bringing it up again, I know for some of us, the sticker shock from that review is just now starting to fade. But, Kuat feels your pain and has released the new Piston Pro. The Piston Pro is supposed to be a “leaner” version of the Piston Pro X. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let’s see what you get when you lose the “X”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-full-rack-opened.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-full-rack-opened-800x301.jpeg\" alt=\"Kuat Piston Pro full rack opened\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-full-rack-opened-800x301.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-full-rack-opened-297x112.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-full-rack-opened-120x45.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-full-rack-opened-768x289.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-full-rack-opened.jpeg 1070w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c. Kuat</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuat says you’ll get “most of the same great features as the Piston Pro X.” Like all-metal construction, OneTap hydro-pneumatic tire arms that make no contact on the bike frame, and tool-free wheel chock slides. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-Full-rack-closed.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-Full-rack-closed-800x283.jpeg\" alt=\"Kuat Piston Pro Full rack closed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-Full-rack-closed-800x283.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-Full-rack-closed-297x105.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-Full-rack-closed-120x42.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-Full-rack-closed-768x272.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-Full-rack-closed.jpeg 1059w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What you won’t get is the Genuine Kashima coat or LED tail lights. Losing those two things drops the retail price down to $1098. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>We’ve always tried to thoughtfully design and produce products that give our customers options. With the Piston Pro, the rider that appreciates the design and the high-quality materials can also appreciate a version that costs a few hundred dollars less</em>,” says Luke Kuschmeader, Founder and CEO of Küat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-loading-bikes.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"503\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-loading-bikes-800x503.jpeg\" alt=\"Kuat Piston Pro loading bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-loading-bikes-800x503.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-loading-bikes-297x187.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-loading-bikes-120x75.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-loading-bikes-768x483.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-Piston-Pro-loading-bikes.jpeg 824w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Piston Pro is still covered by Kuat’s No Worries Limited Warranty and will be ready to order come mid-April, with shipping starting in June 2023. Orders can be placed through Kuat.com, their dealers, or online retailers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Piston Pro Features &amp; Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $1098 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Color: Sandy Black</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>All metal construction</li>\n\n\n\n<li>OneTap hydro-pneumatic tire arms</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No frame contact</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No fade powder coat</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stainless hardware</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Semi-integrated high-strand 12 mm cable lock</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Equipped with QuickConnect for fast and easy installation and removal FastFit tool-free wheel chock system</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PedalPivot</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patented Flatlock hitch cam</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optional eBike ramp for easy loading</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Info</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 Bike Capacity (add-ons available and sold separately)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>67lbs per tray for the 2-bike on a 2″ receiver, 60lbs for the 1.25″ receiver</li>\n\n\n\n<li>42lbs per tray on chassis-mounted RV hitch</li>\n\n\n\n<li>53″ max wheelbase</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5″ max tire width</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.kuat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuat.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kuat-piston-pro-r-bike-rack/\">Kuat Loses the “X” and Adds an ‘Affordable’ Piston Pro</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e29bebd1111deb3a57bc6539f3483a4a1308faedd060f335c7f516573653fbe9","category":"Cycling"}
