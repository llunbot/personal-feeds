While most of Apple’s products are updated irregularly, Apple has reliably launched next-generation iPhones every September <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/09/long-awaited-iphone-5-finally-debuts/\">since the iPhone 5 was announced</a> in 2012. This year, we expect new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.</p>\n<p>The most reliable rumors about Apple's next-gen iPhones (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">gathered here by MacRumors</a> for your convenience) point to mostly iterative improvements to the current versions: marginally larger screens for the Pro phones, an Action Button and a rearranged camera bump for the non-Pro phones, and improved processors for each. Notably, both phones should be compatible with the first wave of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/\">Apple Intelligence AI features</a>; as of this writing, the iPhone 15 Pro is the only iPhone that will support Apple Intelligence when it launches.</p>\n\n<p>Apple also usually announces new Apple Watches at its September events. Updated Apple TV boxes are also occasionally unveiled, though Apple’s streaming box is updated more sporadically than most of its other products. We’re also due to get <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/report-apple-plans-mini-er-mac-mini-its-first-design-update-in-14-years/\">the first wave of M4 Macs</a> at some point soon, including refreshed MacBook Pros and a newly redesigned Mac mini. But Apple often holds Mac launches for a separate event <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/new-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-add-m3-chips-plus-a-1599-entry-level-model/\">sometime in October</a> or November, so don’t be surprised if the Mac goes unmentioned on September 9.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045240#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045240&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"423f2fdaef5b9ba4bd1bc8782042060e3bc114a78b67f1a39585ed9006e8706b","category":"Tech"}
