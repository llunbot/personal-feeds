The first of these landings, on NASA's Artemis III mission, is currently targeted for 2026, although this is widely viewed as an ambitious schedule.</p>\n<p>Last year, NASA awarded a contract to Blue Origin to develop its own human-rated Blue Moon lunar lander, giving Artemis managers two options for follow-on missions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020606#p3\">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020606&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77da0f56479f69de09dec3f33c707e1b286af8cdc415a7aabfb162e6fe9b48cb","category":"Tech"}
