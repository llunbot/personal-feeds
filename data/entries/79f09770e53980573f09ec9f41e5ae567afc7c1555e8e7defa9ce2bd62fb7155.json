Any new models released later this year alongside the public release of ‌watchOS 10‌ will undoubtedly also support the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOptimized Charge Limit is an extension of the Optimized Battery Charging feature that waits to fully charge your battery until just before your device expects you to need your Apple Watch, in order to limit battery degradation due to overcharging. Optimized Charge Limit augments this by predicting how much battery life you are likely to need on any given day and only charging up to a level sufficient for your expected needs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a result, on some days your Apple Watch may charge all the way to 100%, while on other days it might charge to only 80% or 90%. The feature is optional but on by default, and it only engages in locations where you spend a lot of time such as at home or at work, recognizing that less frequently visited locations are more likely to have unpredictable impacts on your watch usage and charging patterns.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also manually override a planned Optimized Charge Limit by tapping the open charging icon after connecting to a charger and selecting the \"Charge to Full Now\" option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor more details on how to manage Optimized Charge Limit, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-watch-ultra-use-optimized-charge-limit/\">check out our how-to on the feature</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1666126255895334913\">Thanks, @aaronp613!</a>)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-9/\">watchOS 9</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-ipados-macos-tvos-watchos-visionos-programming.135\">iOS iPadOS macOS tvOS watchOS visionOS Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/watchos-10-optimized-charge-limit/\">watchOS 10 Extends Optimized Charge Limit to More Apple Watch Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-extends-optimized-charge-limit-to-more-apple-watch-models.2391947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"79f09770e53980573f09ec9f41e5ae567afc7c1555e8e7defa9ce2bd62fb7155","category":"Apple"}
