{"title":"Get ready, the M4 Mac era starts on November 1","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2479827/get-ready-the-m4-mac-era-starts-on-november-1.html","date":1728315958000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">M4 chip made its debut in the iPad Pro</a>, we’ve been wondering when the chip will eventually make its way to the Mac. We’ve long expected them to arrive in October, but according to a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we now know exactly when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman has reported that M4 Macs will arrive this fall, but now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q?cmpid=BBD100624_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=241006&amp;utm_campaign=poweron\">Gurman offers some specifics</a>, stating that an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">announcement</a> will be made around the end of this month, with “at least some of them” shipping on November 1. The new Macs that were previously rumored to ship first are the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a>, and iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman doesn’t specify which Macs are to be included in the “some of them” group, but he has reported in the past that the M4 Pro version of the Mac mini may not be available at the same time as the base M4. Speculating further based on his reports, it could indicate that the November 1 date applies to the base M4 Macs and that the M4 Pro and Max MacBook Pros will also have a later ship date. Also consider that when <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120984/macbook-pro-lineup-with-m3-pro-max-processors-memory-specs.html\">Apple shipped the M3 MacBook Pro last year</a>, the company shipped the base M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max models at the same time, so it’s possible Apple will do that again with the M4 series MacBook Pro and hold the M4 Pro Mac mini for some other reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also reported that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a> will ship in the “first half” of 2025. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M4 Mac Studio</a> will follow with a middle of 2025 release (probably WWDC in June) and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">Mac Pro</a> “in the second half” of 2025. Then in late 2025, Apple will start the M5 Mac release cycle.
