Brands like Hetchins, Bates, and Jack Taylor stuck to the fundamental look of a classic road bike. Outliers like Paris, with its Galibier, and Baines, with its Flying Gate, took an entirely different approach to the classic triangle and rhombus silhouette. </em></p>\n<p><em>While at the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2025-fforest-fondo/\" target=\"_blank\">Fforest Fondo</a>, John met up with Chris, the current torch holder of the <a href=\"https://tjcycles.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">TJ Cycles Flying Gate</a>, one of the original short wheelbase British TT bike designs.

This was the direct result of British “open” road racing being banned in the 1890s due to someone complaining. How British! Cleverly, these road racers switched to host individual time trial races. At the turn of the 20th century, the demand for time trial bicycles was at an all-time high in British cycling, both for <a href=\"https://addiscombe.org/acc-history/chris-watts-acc-history/acc-history-11-post-war-women-tt/\" target=\"_blank\">men and women</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Baines History</h3>\n<p>Reg Baines and his brother Willie opened their bicycle factory in Great Britain in 1919. <span>They made <em>classic</em> British bikes until 1934, when they announced the V.S.37, with 37 referencing the size of the bike’s wheelbase in inches.</span> The V.S.37 model added an extra “vertical” tube, two additional struts, and a chopped-down seat tube.</p>\n<p>Most bikes of the era had very high trail numbers and long wheelbases, so the V.S. 37 was unlike anything else on the market. The benefit of such a design was to slam the rear wheel as close to the bottom bracket as possible. These super short wheelbases meant the bikes were maneuverable and zippy, and the Baines brand argued they were ideal for time trial riding. At the time, riders in Yorkshire wanted bikes that were more responsive, and this design was the Baines’ response.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-50.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-50.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-50.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-50.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Flying Gate Design</h3>\n<p>These were the first bicycles to use the “Flying Gate” design, even though it would take four years for the Baines brothers to rename it that. People called this early design the “Plumber’s Delight,” “Whirlwind,” and the “Five Bar Gate.” In 1938, Baines announced the International TT and Path models. The International TT was designed for road and time trial cycling, while the Path model featured track ends and was used in fixed-gear track racing. With these releases, the design had a name: Flying Gate.</p>\n<p>Baines produced the Flying Gate until 1954. In 1979, a builder named Trevor Jarvis resurrected the design and manufactured the Flying Gate under his moniker, TJ Cycles, in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire. As he grew older, Trevor Jarvis handed the Flying Gate frame production over to an engineer named Jeremy Cartwright. In 2021, Chris Yeomans took over the TJ Cycles brand.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-49.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-49.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Chris and His TJ Cycles Flying Gate</h3>\n<p>Chris learned to make frames in 2016 at the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/inside-the-bicycle-academy/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle Academy</a> and now produces the Flying Gate frames one by one in his workshop. In his time as a builder, Chris has amassed over 60 custom bikes. While the Trevor Jarvis Flying Gates had ornate legwork, the Chris Yeomans era is much more subdued and classic.</p>\n<p>After meeting Chris at the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2025-fforest-ffondo/\" target=\"_blank\">Fforest Ffondo</a>, I immediately recognized the design of the Flying Gate and was surprised to hear Chris say it was a current build offering by his company, TJ Cycles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Chris and I decided to meet up to document his bike once the light softened. Shooting raw or lacquer-coated frames in harsh sunlight can cause the highlights to blow out in wider open apertures. We linked up late afternoon, and I wheeled his bike down to the Fforest grassy lawn in front of the outdoor dining area.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-28.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-28.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-28.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-28.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-41.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-41.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-41.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-41.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-51.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-51.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-51.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-51.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The mix of a classic Baines silhouette with modern Hope parts felt quintessentially British. I spent a good amount of time capturing the details of the frame. While doing so, Petor set up a drone and began documenting me documenting Chris’ bike. So meta! As I finished, Konstantin Drust exclaimed, “We should fly the drone through it!”. Konstantin knows that Petor has the habit of doing what he says.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/TJ-Cycles-Flying-Gate-Road-Bike-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>After the firmware rebooted on the drone – sigh – we were airborne.  As it approached the crux move, the drone crashed into the vertical tube of the bike. This <a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9143.mov\" target=\"_blank\">resulted in some mild hysteria</a>. A few more runs and <a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Video-2025-05-05-at-10.42.38.mp4\" target=\"_blank\">Petor’s drone hand was dialed</a>. No bicycles were harmed in this bit of front lawn jackassery.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to Chris for being a good sport and for keeping a part of British framebuilding heritage alive.
