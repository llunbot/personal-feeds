Apparently the curve of the bar changed and teams were moving the mounts over to their new bikes and found a gap, so K-Edge got to work to make a new mount that sat flush. And now it’s available for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"k-edge custom laser etching and anodized colors for out-front computer mounts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/k-edge-custom-laser-etched-graphics-computer-mounts-01.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve expanded their laser etching designs and options, too, letting you dress up your bike with subtle accent points.
