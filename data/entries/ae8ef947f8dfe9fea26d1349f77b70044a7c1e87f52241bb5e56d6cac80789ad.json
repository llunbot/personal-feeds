Websites with an existing dark theme will default to that instead of using Google's new dark mode option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Auto ‌Dark Mode‌ activated, the Google app will automatically swap over to the dark theme for websites whenever ‌Dark Mode‌ on your Apple device is activated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature was previously available through Search Labs, but it is now rolling out to all users. The option can be activated by tapping on the three dots in the upper right corner when visiting a website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Google app is free to download from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
