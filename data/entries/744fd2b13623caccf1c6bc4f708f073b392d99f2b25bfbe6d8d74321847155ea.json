The issue appears to have affected a variety of Macs, ranging from the M1 MacBook Air with a built-in trackpad to an Intel-based iMac paired with a standalone Magic Trackpad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the release of the fourth macOS 12.1 beta today, several users <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tap-to-click-issues-on-b9-and-10-and-now-monterey-release.2317279/page-10\">across the MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/r6leuc/macos_121_beta_4_incoming/hmua4q0/\">Reddit</a> have indicated that they are no longer experiencing issues with \"Tap to Click\" after updating to this version.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"Tap to Click\" can be enabled in System Preferences under Trackpad &gt; Point &amp; Click, allowing users to tap with one finger to click.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nmacOS 12.1 should be publicly released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/01/macos-12-1-release-date-expectations/\">before the end of the year</a>, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/shareplay-macos-monterey-12-1-beta/\">key new feature being SharePlay</a>, which will allow users to watch movies and TV shows, listen to music, and share their screen with friends and family on FaceTime calls.
