To celebrate,  they’ve set a global goal of getting 1 million bikes back on the road by the end of 2025. And not just Specialized bikes – any bike. To do so, Specialized has launched its <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/store-finder?filters=c_reduceReuse\" target=\"_blank\">Reduce, Reuse, ReSpecialized</a> Program. On October 26th (and only on October, 26th), Specialized will celebrate its 50th anniversary by offering free repairs, tune-ups, and bike discounts in hopes of getting any brand of bike back in riding shape and back on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reduce, Reuse, ReSpecialized Program is a global effort. It offers free minor tune-ups, helmets, and discounted repairs at participating retail locations. The program applies to <em>any</em> rider, with <em>any </em>bike, from <em>any</em> brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-service-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-service-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Bikes Reduce, Reuse, ReSpecialized service\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-service-jpeg.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-service-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-service-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-service-768x1024.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Specialized Bicycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized states the Reduce, Reuse, ReSpecialized Program is the first of its kind. It underlines their mission to move the planet forward, by using the bicycle as a powerful way to deliver mental, physical, and environmental benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to point out that the scope of the free service is limited. Don’t expect a major overhaul for free, but if your bike has been hanging for years and was in good shape before it took an extended vacation, that should qualify. You also have to pay for any parts needed. If your bike does need a big repair, it seems that Specialized will be offering discount coupons to help offset the cost. Check out the fine print section below for more details. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does Mr. Sinyard have to Say About It?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>For 50 years, we’ve been motivated by the pure love of riding and spotlighting the benefits bikes provide for our communities and health,</em>” says Specialized Founder Mike Sinyard. “<em>For example, we formed <a href=\"https://outridebike.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Outride</a>, a non-profit committed to using cycling to support the cognitive and physical well-being of youth to underline the power of two wheels – as we look toward the future, we don’t care what kind of bike you ride, we just want you riding it. By getting one million bikes back on the road and inspiring more to ride, we can collectively reduce our carbon footprint, help our bodies, and steer toward a better future</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Bikes Reduce, Reuse, ReSpecialized hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Specialized-Bikes-Reduce-Reuse-ReSpecialized-hero-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Impact?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an idea of the impact the Reduce, Reuse, ReSpecialized program can have: according to Specialized, if the program were to get 1 million new riders on bikes in the next year, pedaling an average of only 12 miles a week it could…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce global carbon emissions by 438 million kilograms of CO2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Burn 25 billion calories</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduce screen time by 66.6 million hours</li>\n\n\n\n<li>equal the C02 reduction of planting 7,242,368 million new trees</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s pretty amazing. I guess bicycles really could save the world… if we let them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Reduce, Reuse, and ReSpecialized events including repair info, participating U.S. retail partner locations, and what will happen on October 26th, visit <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/store-finder?filters=c_reduceReuse\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Fine Print: Terms and Conditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reduce, Reuse, ReSpecialized program (ReSpecializedProgram) is available at participating Specialized Retailers and will take place October 26, 2024, only. The ReSpecialized Program is limited to select services, which may or may not include flat tire repair, minor brake and shifting adjustment and repair, component and lubrication, and other similar minor repairs required to service the bicycle and as determined by the participating Specialized Retailer. While there is no cost to the owner of the bicycle (the rider) for the select services offered under the ReSpecialized Program, the Rider is responsible for the cost of parts, which can be purchased at the participating Specialized Retailer. For services and repairs not covered under the ReSpecialized Program, such as minor and major tune-ups and replacement of cables or other componentry, the Rider is able to schedule the service with the participating Specialized Retailer. The Rider agrees to pay for the services and repairs rendered, as well as any parts required for the service and repair provided. Each participating Specialized Retailer reserves the right to determine what services and repairs are offered under the ReSpecialized Program, as well as services and repairs that are beyond the scope of the ReSpecialized program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-celebrates-50-years-with-free-tune-ups-for-everyone/\">Specialized Celebrates 50 Years by Getting All Kinds of Bikes Back on the Road!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8ecc10912c582480803043404b5bd77b3837305a0c37cc0048c1ee06dbb653ed","category":"Cycling"}
