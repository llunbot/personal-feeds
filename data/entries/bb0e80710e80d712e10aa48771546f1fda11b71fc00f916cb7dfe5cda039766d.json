Its frameset appears to be identical to the one on which Pogačar crossed the finish line in Paris on Sunday, too.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/colnago-v3rs-white-tour-de-france-8e479d5.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The white and black version of the V3Rs represents the young rider’s jersey. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Colnago</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/colnago-v3rs-polka-dot-8857fdc.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=540%2C702\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Similar to the white and black V3Rs, this version has the distinctive red polka dots of the King of the Mountains jersey.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Colnago</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe two other bikes are very similar to look at, with a white and black design, but one has the distinctive red polka dots of the Tour de France climber’s jersey laid over white paintwork.\n<p>Colnago says each of the bikes “will be delivered with a unique piece of memorabilia that holds its own special money-can’t-buy status: an original Tour rankings jersey autographed by Tadej Pogačar, complete with UAE Team Emirates logos and other team sponsors”.</p>\n<p>The signed jerseys will match the bikes, so the yellow and black model will come with a yellow leader’s jersey and so on.</p>\n<p>If you do want to put a price on the money-can’t-buy status, the bikes have a suggested retail price of £12,090 / $16,690 / €14,090.</p>\n<h2>Colnago V3Rs Capsule Collection spec</h2>\n<p>Colnago has specced these V3Rs bikes with top-quality components and has said that it wants the spec to affirm the leading quality of products made in Italy.</p>\n<p>It is no surprise then that the bikes have a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/campagnolo/\">Campagnolo</a> groupset as well as Deda and Vittoria parts:</p>\n<ul><li>Colnago V3Rs frameset</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/campagnolo-super-record-12-speed-disc-review/\">Campagnolo Super Record EPS Disc 12-speed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto/\">Campagnolo Bora Ultra WTO DB</a> wheels with C-LUX finish</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/vittoria-corsa-tlr-g2-0-tyre-review/\">Vittoria Corsa</a> clincher tyres</li>\n<li>Deda Elementi ALANERA DCR (with Deda internal cable routing) handlebar</li>\n<li>Prologo Scratch M5 Nack saddle</li>\n<li>Colnago carbon bottle cage</li>\n</ul><h2>Tadej Pogačar’s Stage 21 Tour de France bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pogačar rode a yellow and black bike, but also wore one polka dot shoe to represent his success in the King of the Mountains competition.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>It has become something of a tradition on the final stage of the Tour de France – where custom dictates no one challenges the general classification leader – that the winner of the race goes out in full yellow regalia.</p>\n<p>But, unlike last year, when Pogačar rode a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/pogacar-bennett-bikes-paris/\">custom-painted yellow Colnago</a>, it looks like he was riding the yellow and black bike from Colnago’s Capsule Collection on the Champs-Élysées – making <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/mathieu-van-der-poel-yellow-canyon-aeroad-cfr/\">Mathieu van der Poel’s Canyon Aeroad CFR</a> the only completely yellow bike at this year’s race.</p>\n<p>The eagle-eyed among you will have also noticed that Pogačar raced the final stage wearing mismatched shoes; where one shoe was yellow and the other was a red and white polka dot design.
