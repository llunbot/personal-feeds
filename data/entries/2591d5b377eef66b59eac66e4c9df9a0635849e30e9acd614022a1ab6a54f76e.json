It ditches the Home button and moves the Touch ID sensor to the power button like the iPad mini. It also has full support for Apple’s just-released USB-C Apple Pencil for $79.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10 th-gen iPad is an excellent tablet but Apple has better options if you’re spending full price. At this discount it gets our full recommendation. Just note, you’ll need to sign up for a free Target Circle account to get this price.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2591d5b377eef66b59eac66e4c9df9a0635849e30e9acd614022a1ab6a54f76e","category":"Apple"}
