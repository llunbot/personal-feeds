Apple has been updating its rules after receiving feedback from the European Commission, and it specifically updated its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/app-store-external-links-european-union/\">external linking rules</a> last August after it became clear the EU was not happy with its anti-steering policies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe rapid fire changes that Apple implemented can be confusing, so app developers who distribute apps in the EU can keep up with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/\">the EU rules site</a> on Apple's developer website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the Digital Markets Act gives regulators the ability to fine companies up to 10 percent of their global annual sales, sources that spoke to <em>Reuters</em> said the European Commission is aiming to ensure that companies comply with the law rather than sanctioning them with large fines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nU.S. President Donald Trump has also claimed that he will impose tariffs on countries that fine U.S. companies like Apple, plus there has been a change in the European Commission's leadership, so Apple may not be facing the same monetary punishment that it would have received last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe EU has not yet decided on the size of the fine, so the situation could change, but <em>Reuters</em> says a decision is expected this month.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-modest-fine-eu-digital-markets-act/\">Apple Facing 'Modest' Fine for Violating EU's Digital Markets Act</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-facing-modest-fine-for-violating-eus-digital-markets-act.2452740/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0cd96d05cd0ea79d5562758293b2f601c4c18447ab7ae13d2b55dd68d2fbf5b5","category":"Apple"}
