The race of the falling leaves has been dominated by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> recently, winning the last two editions, and he’s back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However Pogačar is set to face stiff competition from great rival <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a>, who’s riding his final races of his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a> career after an incredible year for the team and will be looking to finish it off in style. Roglič may be getting replaced by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> if the Jumbo-Visma/<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> merger does happen and the Belgian is looking to make up for a disappointing season in Grand Tours by ticking another Monument off the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re not the only ones racing of course, but who could <em>actually </em>win Il Lombardia?</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadej Pogačar has won the last two editions of Il Lombardia and he’ll want to finish his season off strong after disappointment at the Tour de France. A fully fit Pogačar can beat anyone. He did however, get beaten by Primož Roglič at the recent Giro dell’Emilia after Pogačar’s UAE Team Emirates teammates tried to control for him and his compatriot took advantage. If he comes to the finish with Roglič he’ll be nervous.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Primož Roglič, Jumbo-Visma</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-970x641.jpg\" alt=\"man in red cycling jersey\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-970x641.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-300x198.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-768x508.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-750x496.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-1140x754.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Luis Angel Gomez ©PHOTOGOMEZSPORT2019 via Unipublic</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pog and Rog back on top – it feels like the good old days. In what’s probably his last race for Jumbo-Visma, Roglič will want to go out with a bang and securing his second Monument will be a big goal to tick off for the 33-year-old. He’ll trust his sprint and try to follow moves to be in the front group at the end to launch for victory. He’s clearly in form post-Vuelta, it’d be brave to bet against him.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remco Evenepoel, Soudal-QuickStep</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"man on bike with hands on head and crowds cheering behind hoardings next to road flying Belgium flags\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/liege-2022-remco-celebrate-getty-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Bas Czerwinski/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remco Evenepoel is one of the best one-day racers in the world, it wouldn’t be surprising if Il Lombardia is over before it’s even started if he launches a long-range attack. He has ridden the race once since his horror crash in 2020, coming 19th the year after, but he’s a much stronger rider now than he was in 2021. His Vuelta collapse may be worrying but he showed very quickly that it was one bad day. He absolutely won’t want to leave it to the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outsiders</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Carapaz riding back from sign-on before Stage 1 of the 2023 Tour de France\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Richard-Carapaz-2023-Tour-de-France.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not always the strongest rider on paper that wins one-day races, and there are several viable challengers who could benefit from bad tactical decisions or just being the better man on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Richard Carapaz</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Olympic Champion won on a very tough course in Japan and doesn’t have a Grand Tour in his legs after his Tour de France Stage 1 DNF. Tricky Dicky should be taken seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enric Mas</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enric came second last year and will want <em>más</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yates (probably Simon)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Simon and Adam Yates will be lining up in Como on Saturday but Adam will likely be playing for a Pogačar win. Simon doesn’t have a good record at Il Lombardia but came fourth at the Tour de France and still has good legs, finishing third at Giro dell-Emilia behind Roglič and Pogačar last Saturday. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thibaut Pinot</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The goat. He won it before, it’s his final show, he’ll leave it all out on the road, can he finish on a high?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Michał Kwiatkowski</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Monument winner, underrated climber, had incredible legs at the Tour de France, and has a legitimate chance of the favourites letting him slip away.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ben Healy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First year sensation Ben Healy has lit up hilly Classics and stages and will rightly be confident he could pull off an upset. He’d have to benefit from a few bad decisions behind though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Cyclist prediction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar, Roglič and Evenepoel will be too worried about each other and left stranded once Richard Carapaz storms up the road to his first Monument victory in the Ecuadorian national champs jersey.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/il-lombardia-favourites\">Who are the favourites for Il Lombardia 2023?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"61047bf43bdd998e138e83bf213ac23b340e635e1e92090a764f8c7dac8ac92b","category":"Cycling"}
