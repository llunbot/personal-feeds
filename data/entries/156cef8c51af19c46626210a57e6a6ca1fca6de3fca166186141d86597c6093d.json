You can work with any app documents, update your iPhone, print or safe messages, copy music, or even make backups of your data. From one app, you can access your voicemail, call history, memos, and notes, which may not seem that special until you realize you can do that from any of your devices. iMazing is the only way to get this level of convenience from your devices without jailbreaking them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a limited time, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://shop.macworld.com/sales/imazing-ios-manager-1-device-license?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=imazing-ios-manager-1-device-license&amp;utm_term=scsf-520579&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004Uav5QAC&amp;scsonar=1&amp;xcust=1-1-551571-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iMazing iOS Manager</a> is on sale for just $14.99 (Reg. $34).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Prices subject to change</em>. </p>\n</div>","author":"DealPost Team","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"156cef8c51af19c46626210a57e6a6ca1fca6de3fca166186141d86597c6093d","category":"Apple"}
