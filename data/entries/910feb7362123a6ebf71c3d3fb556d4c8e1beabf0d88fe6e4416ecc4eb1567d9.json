It then sets up real-time scanning features and intuitive network monitoring, allowing users to see and work with both incoming and outgoing Internet connections on their Mac.</p>\n\n<p>While Mac Security X9 doesn’t offer every feature, it offers impressive configuration and customization to both its VirusBarrier and NetBarrier tools. VirusBarrier performs well in protecting users from viruses, while NetBarrier acts as a firewall that protects connections. The application allows users to create settings for home, work, or public connections, and allows or deny connections as needed.</p>\n\n<p>There are some issues to address, such as a running counter tracking the number of files processed in a VirusBarrier scan and allowing traffic to questionable websites linked to spam messages. </p>\n\n<p>Despite these issues, Mac Security X9 doesn’t try to upsell users to Intego’s other suites and services, making it worth considering.

Avast Free Antivirus is a free version of Avast Premium Security, while Avast One Essential offers additional features like ransomware protection, privacy protection, and data leak detection. </p>\n\n<p>Avast Premium Security is a well-featured suite that protects your Mac from various threats, including browser script hacks, ransomware, and remote attack activity. It includes modules such as Virus Scans, Core Shields, Traffic Monitor, Network Inspector, Email Guardian, Ransomware Shield, and Quarantine, all easily accessible from the home screen.</p>\n\n<p>Virus scan options include Smart Scan, Deep Scan, Targeted Scan, or External Storage Scan. The Traffic Monitor shows data usage and bandwidth usage, while Network Inspector scans the network for safety and alerts users when unfamiliar devices join the network. Core Shields prevents fake websites from loading and triggering software.</p>\n\n<p>The main frustration with Avast Premium Security is its subscription-based model, but that tends to be standard these days. Some features are only available on the Avast Ultimate subscription tier.</p>\n\n<p>For those looking to save money can try the two free Antivirus for Mac solutions: Avast’s Free antivirus for Mac was among the best products in a June 2023 test by AV-Comparatives, detecting 100% of Mac malware, 99 percent of potentially unwanted applications, and 100% of Windows viruses.

There is a 60-day free trial though, which could be enough for your purposes. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, this is a great option, despite being basic.

You can control what Total Protection does when it finds suspect files, such as notifying you, quarantining them, or deleting the files. During our tests, it located and quarantined two suspected virus files I didn’t know about, thereby earning its keep.</p>\n\n<p>Other features include an ID Protection tool that compares your email address to known data and password breaches, a firewall, and a Secure VPN feature that lets you quickly set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p>\n\n<p>McAfee’s Total Protection package extends up to five devices on one account, so it’s easy to add the app to other Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Android-based phones and tablets as needed. It’s worth noting that the Windows version offers features that you don’t get in the Mac app.</p>\n\n<p>We noted some occasional performance impacts as it ran in the background, but it was largely unobtrusive in its efforts.

The Standard package protects one device. For more devices (including Macs, iPhones or PCs), the Deluxe or Select package are required. Note that all prices increase significantly after the first year. </p>\n\n<p>The software offers 110GB of cloud-based backup, a password manager, a basic VPN client, and Dark Web monitoring.</p>\n\n<p>Norton 360 is easy to download and install, and its add-on programs work fairly well. The VPN is basic but easy to configure your preferred country of origin and initiate a connection. The password manager is reliable and includes a downloadable recovery key. There is an admirable level of possible customization on the firewall, although technical knowledge is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Other utilities within Norton 360 for Mac include a Startup Manager module, File Cleanup module, and Dark Web protection module. With antiviral monitoring and scanning it’s easy to create white lists and exceptions as well as schedule scans, including of external volumes like USB thumb drives. However, the application still can’t perform scans on .zip files, I had to decompress the text drive of sample infections before it could see them. </p>\n\n<p>In our tests, the software was successful in catching a good amount of viral activity, with 25 individual infections detected on a test drive after scanning it. However, Norton 360 for Mac missed the OSX.Proton malware.</p>\n\n<p>Extensions for web browsers and Norton Private Browser are included. These warn about spam and phishing-based websites, but still allowed us to travel to questionable websites from spam email links. </p>\n\n<p>However, there are still bugs to sort out, such as a bug in the Cloud Backup were we were unable to successfully click the “Get Started with Backup” button and create an initial backup set for the cloud. It also failed to remove OSX.Proton malware.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://norton.com/products/norton-360-deluxe\" target=\"_blank\">You can get Norton 360 here</a>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668092/norton-360-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorton 360 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.

It offers a speedy Quick Scan mode that performs a quick overview and locate, quarantine, and remove viral candidates within a few minutes as well as a Full Scan mode which runs in the background so you can continue to work. External volumes such as USB flash drives can be scanned. </p>\n\n<p>There isn’t much in the way of malware that gets by it. However, we found the application’s ability to locate and neutralize malware that was already on the system mixed – it missed four significant pieces of malware. </p>\n\n<p>Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offers anti-phishing protection in the form of web browser extensions for the Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox web browsers. These offered varying degrees of success. Under Safari, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offered no prominent phishing protection, allowing us to visit questionable websites with no warning whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offers an anti-tracker for web browsers and access to a VPN with basic functionality and a limit of 200MB a day.

Prices start at $59.99/£51.99/CA$67 for 5 devices for the first year, then $104.99/£90.99/CA$118 a year.</p>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.avira.com/en/free-security\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Free Security for Mac</a> lets you run a quick scan to check out system files and other vulnerable areas, or a full scan to analyze your entire Mac for malware, but not much else. </p>\n\n<p>Avira Prime is designed around several modules: Virus Scans (including Quick Scan. Full Scan and Custom Scan), Protection Options, Quarantine, VPN, Passwords, Cookie Cleaner, Identity Assistant, Junk Cleaner, Uninstaller, and Startup Apps. A single large window presents the various features, from scans to app management and cleanup, although a couple of its features use a separate panel for a web-based console. In our tests, it detected all our compromised files and installers–although we were concerned that it missed the problematic Wave web browser virus. It doesn’t look inside zip archives or disk images, but it pounces as soon as items are extracted from these.</p>\n\n<p>Even while Avira Prime is actively scanning for trouble it has such a small impact on the general performance of our Mac that we wouldn’t notice it without comparing timings. </p>\n\n<p>Avira Prime scored well in <a href=\"https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/mac-security-test-review-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">AV Comparitives</a> June 2023 tests scoring 99% for Mac Malware protection and 99% for Mac PUA Protection, while <a href=\"https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-macos/macos-ventura/september-2023/avira-security-2.1-235303/\" target=\"_blank\">AV Test</a> gave Avira 99.5% in March 2024. </p>\n\n<p>You can get the basics of the security features with Avira Free Security, but Prime’s annual subscription provides useful additional capabilities, including an unlimited VPN, if you can stomach the cost.</p>\n\n<p>Avira Free Security for Mac seems to offer a lot of features for free. But most actually require a paid subscription, so the product’s overall usefulness is limited and the constant sales pitches are annoying.</p>\n\n<p>The free app will run scans daily, weekly, or monthly. You can also create a custom scan. There are also real-time virus protection scans to scan new files saved to your computer or downloaded from the internet. You have to pay to scan a USB drive. Malware discovered is automatically quarantined. Avira was effective at detecting and stopping malware when we tested it.</p>\n\n<p>The free version of Avira also includes the junk cleaner that can identify issues via a smart scan, but you need to pay to actually clean up anything beyond the junk files. </p>\n\n<p>You can get <a href=\"https://www.avira.com\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Prime here.</a> Also consider <a href=\"https://www.avira.com/en/free-security\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Free Security for Mac</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668094/avira-free-security-for-mac-review.html\">Avira Free Security for Mac review</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668098/avira-prime-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAvira Prime review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.

A quick scan checks system files and other areas on your Mac, you can select just your hard drive to run a scan on all folders and files on the disk, and dragging and dropping a single folder or file onto the scanning pane checks it for malware. You can also select an external drive or connected USB stick for scanning. There’s also a real-time scanning component–Sentry–that is always on guard. </p>\n\n<p>It is possible to schedule any type of scan to run on specific days and times.

ClamXAV is certainly effective at virus scanning, but that’s a capability found in many free and equally effective security products for the Mac. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233228/clamxav-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClamXav review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12.

It includes quick viral scans, functional scheduling for scans, decent customization elements including whitelist creation, a good VPN client, and Real-Time protection that keeps an eye on what’s attempting to be installed.</p>\n\n<p>The software performed well, offering speedy scans.

It includes several useful features, but lacks certain key options, especially in virus scanning. </p>\n\n<p>The program is $69.99/£59.99 a year for one device, which is steep, but there’s a free 30-day trial that requires no credit card and even gives you free technical support if you need it. </p>\n\n<p>Clicking the Scan button runs a full virus scan that checks your entire system, while clicking the link for Viruses &amp; Threats takes you to another screen where you can scan just specific folders. But there are no options to run a quick scan or even to schedule a scan, unlike the Windows version which includes a quick scan. It provides real-time virus and spyware scanning to automatically block malware, and ‘DeepGuard’ monitors applications for any changes indicative of a malware infection. </p>\n\n<p>You can set up ID monitoring to check your email address for data breaches among your online accounts. The VPN is another defense and includes tracking protection to prevent advertisers from monitoring your online activity and a kill switch to quickly cut off all internet traffic. </p>\n\n<p>F-Secure offers a password vault that creates and stores secure logins for all your accounts. The password vault requires an extension that supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Safari isn’t yet supported. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, F-Secure doesn’t let you review blocked or deleted malicious files, and no setting allows you to quarantine files instead of removing them. </p>\n\n<p>F-Secure’s Safe (which was the old name for F-Secure Internet Security) was tested by AV-Test in June 2023 and scored 5 out of 6 for protection, 5.5 out of 6 for performance and 6 for usability. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668100/f-secure-total-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tF-Secure Total review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14.

The suite will protect your Macs (as well as PCs, and other smartphones and tablets, but unfortunately not iOS). We tested ESET Home Security Premium, which offers extensive antiviral and malware protection, and Real-time File System Protection, as well as a password manager, an encryption tool – although it turned out the latter two were missing from the version we reviewed, which appears to be an error. </p>\n\n<p>The software can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://www.eset.com/home/protection-plans/\">ESET’s website</a>. There is a <a href=\"https://www.eset.com/us/home/free-trial/\">30-day trial</a> available with only an email address and no credit or debit card needed. ESET Home can also be found on the U.S. version of the Mac App Store, but the download doesn’t actually work. </p>\n\n<p>ESET Home Security Premium retails at different price points given the number of devices it’s installed on and the number of years you subscribe for. It’s usually $59.99/£44.99 for one device for one year, scaling up from there, but there are discounts from time to time which can be seen on the <a href=\"https://www.eset.com/us/home/protection-plans/\">ESET website</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The application allows for changes such as blacklists and whitelists to be created, different levels of detection and sensitivity, access to the logs and proxy servers, reactions as to new volumes being mounted, and an impressive level of customization.</p>\n\n<p>Scheduled scans can be set up easily, and it’s fairly simple to designate which areas of a local or cloud-based drive will be scanned and when. In our tests ESET’s initial scan was able to locate and quarantine 18 suspect files without incident.</p>\n\n<p>However, issues within the software included: extremely long scan times ranging from seven to more than 24 hours to look over an internal solid-state drive, the scheduler feature failing to activate a scan, a lack of a progress bar or elapsed time readout during a scan, the software’s uninstall feature failing to install multiple times, and our copy of the ESET Home Security Premium software arriving without the advertised password manager or encryption features.</p>\n\n<p>While ESET Home Security Premium completes its primary task of antiviral and malware prevention, several bugs and omissions need to be fixed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2370689/eset-home-security-premium-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEset Home Security Premium review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Best Free Mac Antivirus </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve included our pick of the best free options above, but here are our top five recommendations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avast.com/free-mac-security#mac\" target=\"_blank\">Avast Free Antivirus</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avg.com/en-us/homepage#mac\" target=\"_blank\">AVG Antivirus for the Mac</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/virus-scanner-for-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bitdefender Virus Scanner for Mac</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avira.com/en/free-security\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Free Security for Mac</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intego-virusbarrier-scanner/id1200445649?mt=12\" target=\"_blank\">Intego VirusBarrier Scanner</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mac Antivirus: Specs Comparison</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Developer</strong></th><th><strong>Product name</strong></th><th><strong>USB scan</strong></th><th><strong>Ransomware protection</strong></th><th><strong>Adware prevention</strong></th><th><strong>Anti phishing  protection</strong></th><th><strong>Email protection</strong></th><th><strong>Firewall</strong></th><th><strong>VPN</strong></th><th><strong>iOS version</strong></th><th><strong>Parental Controls</strong></th><th><strong>Support</strong></th><th><strong>Trial</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Intego</strong></td><td>Internet Security X9</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>7 days</td><td>$49.99/£49.99 / ye ($24.99/£20.99 /yr deal)</td></tr><tr><td>AVG</td><td>AntiVirus for Mac</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>60 days</td><td>Free (Paid for version is $2.49 per month for one year / $2.39 a month for two-years / $2.29 a month for three-years)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Norton </strong></td><td>360 Deluxe</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.99/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>McAfee</strong></td><td>Total Protection </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$34.99/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Avast </strong></td><td>Premium Security</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>60 days</td><td>$44.99/£39.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitdefender</strong></td><td>Total Security </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.97/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eset </strong></td><td>Cyber Security Pro </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$49.95/£39.95/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trend Micro</strong></td><td>Antivirus for Mac</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.99/£49.95</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Avira </strong></td><td>Prime</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$99.99/£85.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mac Antivirus: Buying Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><h2> FAQ </h2><hr />\n<div><div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Do Macs even need antivirus software?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Plenty of Mac users will tell you that Apple computers are inherently secure and don’t require protection. We’d argue that they are wrong, or at very least overconfident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long ago, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676327/silver-sparrow-malware-detected-on-m1-macs-what-you-need-to-know.html\">Silver Sparrow malware</a> was detected on Macs powered by the M1 processor and infected hundreds of thousands of Macs. And it’s just one example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad guys are absolutely targeting Mac users – and they’re getting smarter and greedier. Cyber security is something you can’t afford to ignore, and good Mac antivirus will help keep you safe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668710/how-secure-mac.html\">Macs are generally more secure</a> than their Windows brethren because macOS is a Unix-based operating system, which means it is sandboxed. This is like having a series of fire doors: even if malware gains access to your Mac, it is unable to spread to other areas of the machine. But while they are more difficult to exploit than Windows PCs, it is not impossible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read more about this topic in our article <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670537/do-macs-need-antivirus.html\">do Macs need antivirus?</a> More general advice can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432223/mac-security-tips-password-find-my-users-lockdown-mode.html\">Mac security tips</a>; and those who have been hit by a malware attack should see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671430/how-remove-virus-mac.html\">how to remove a virus from a Mac</a>. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>What features should I look for in Mac antivirus?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>All Mac antivirus software packages find viruses using both on-demand- and always-on protection. The former examines individual files either during scheduled scans or when you decide to run one. This can take a long time, especially if you have a lot of files, and some antivirus products will hog your Mac’s processor power to prioritise the scan, so it’s worth selecting a convenient time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always-on malware protection protects you when a scan is not currently active. If malware arrives – perhaps via an email or a downloaded file – your antivirus software should detect and quarantine it. Quarantining a file involves moving it to a safe folder, allowing you to decide what to do with it. You’ll typically receive a notification of the discovered malware, but some Mac antivirus products can be more informative than others in these notifications (something we keep in mind in our testing).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effectiveness of this on-demand and always-on virus protection is absolutely the most important thing when it comes to choosing Mac antivirus, but additional features may also affect your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Mac security suites now include ransomware protection. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a fee to decrypt them. An anti-ransomware feature will typically block any app from writing to a user’s home folders, such as Documents or Photos, unless that app has been whitelisted. Some apps, such as Microsoft Word, are pre-approved, and you can whitelist any that you trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web protection via browser plugins or extensions is also a common component and aims to stop you (or your children) from visiting infected websites or handing over personal information when you shouldn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different vendors offer different add-ons, and it is certainly a case of you get what you pay for: free products will have fewer bells and whistles, but the most comprehensive Mac security suites will include password managers, parental controls, cloud storage and more. The underlying antimalware engine will usually be the same for all security products from a particular company, so you can save money if you don’t need all those extra features.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Should my Mac antivirus include a VPN?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>One of the add-ons you might find with Mac security products, although also commonly sold separately, is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668698/best-vpn-for-mac-2.html\">Mac VPN</a> (virtual private network). For many users these are of interest because they can mask your location and allow you to view things (like streaming series) that are otherwise off-limits in your location. But they also have a very real benefit for security, protecting your internet connection by encrypting it, which is especially useful when using public Wi-Fi networks. In this day and age we should all be using VPNs and, while we’d recommend buying a dedicated Mac VPN product, one built into your antivirus software is better than nothing – just be prepared to be nagged to upgrade to the full product.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>4.</span>\n<h3>What is the best value Mac antivirus?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Value is perceived differently by all users: for some the best value Mac antivirus is the free one, and for others it is the one that is affordable but includes the most useful add-ons. We prefer to consider value in terms of which is the best all-round offering, rather than the budget deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are ways you can save money even on the more expensive products. Bear in mind that all antivirus for Mac apps are sold as yearly subscriptions, and often the first year has a hefty discount. When that first year is up, there’s nothing stopping you switching to another product and benefiting from that discount again. Alternatively, opt for a three- or even five-year subscription to save even more money – and why not: it’s not like viruses are going to disappear in the meantime and you won’t need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best Mac antivirus products can also cater to your other devices – and not just iPads and iPhones, but also Windows and Android devices. If you have multiple devices in your household, this can present a huge saving.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>5.</span>\n<h3>How do I spot fake Mac antivirus software?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Because many of us are waking up to the idea that malware is a threat to the Mac, malware writers have made it their business to play on that fear. There have been cases of malware writers disguising their viruses as antivirus apps – two notable examples are Mac Auto Fixer and MacDefender. It’s important to always read reviews on reputable sites such as Macworld before installing any software on your Mac or MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, don’t believe everything you read. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552819/mackeeper-review.html\">MacKeeper</a> is a great example of an antivirus program that has got a bad rap, but it’s worked hard to repair its reputation. It has gained Apple Notarization, which means the software has been checked by Apple for malicious components, and the company has garnering certification from various bodies to prove it isn’t a PUP (potentially unwanted program), including an AV-Test certificate. That said, we haven’t recommended it here, and that’s simply because we feel that there are better options available. If you have already installed MacKeeper and wish to try one of our alternative recommendations, we explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/224718/how-to-uninstall-mackeeper-from-your-mac.html\">How to uninstall MacKeeper</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>6.</span>\n<h3>What can’t Mac antivirus protect you from?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Using a Mac antivirus product, especially one that includes tools to improve your online privacy, may lull you into believing you’re completely safe from personal and private information leaking out and that you no longer need to keep your wits about you. That’s not quite the case. While there’s no reason to panic, you should still practice caution – and there are a few more issues you should consider when using Mac antivirus, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, an antivirus for Mac product may upload the complete text of files flagged to the cloud, where it can be analyzed by separate tools hosted there. This practice is normal and sensible: some malware can detect when a running process may examine it, and will then engage in subterfuge. Antivirus software makers also can access their massive databases to examine files with characteristics that trigger their algorithms – certain elements that match known malware. As a result, security researchers discover new viruses, worms, Trojans horses, and the like. However, helping the greater good means you’ll have to be comfortable with trusting a third-party with your file contents. Where appropriate, we noted privacy policy issues in individual reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, this software may also rely partly or entirely on cloud-based checks of URLs, malware, and the like. Accordingly, an antivirus package might upload every URL you visit, metadata about files, signatures of files, information about your computer’s hardware, a list of running or installed applications, and more. Companies vary on their disclosure of such policies, and may not let you opt out of this kind of sharing. We note issues in each review as appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, antivirus software makers also get a sense of what behavior is happening on your computer that’s being monitored or blocked, and may use that information for their own purposes. In some cases, you can opt out of this information gathering.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>7.</span>\n<h3>How we test Mac antivirus software </h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Each software package is evaluated creating a clean installation of macOS, cloning it for each antivirus product, and then booting separately into each one to install a different package. This is to ensure that previous app installations don;t interfere with new ones – sometimes antivirus software treats other antivirus software as an infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to visiting malicious websites, downloading known malicious software, and even running said malware on our Mac, we also reference the most recent reports from two labs that regularly cover macOS malware: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232gbh&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV Comparatives</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232bgc&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV-TEST</a>. These laboratories test antivirus software against sets of known malware as well as products that are grouped as potentially unwanted applications (like adware).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter doesn’t damage or expose your computer or its files but may consume power and CPU cycles. Because the testing effectively looks at a combination of virus databases and behavior, they remain good gauges even after many months. When an antivirus for Mac software package lacks a rating from a known security research lab, we do more extensive testing with real malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, while we gave props for a lot of different features and behaviors, we mark down products if they lack any or all of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A nearly perfect score on macOS malware detection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ransomware monitoring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Native browser plug-in or system-level Web proxy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A high score on Windows malware detection</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"910feb7362123a6ebf71c3d3fb556d4c8e1beabf0d88fe6e4416ecc4eb1567d9","category":"Apple"}
