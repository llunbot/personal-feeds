Tesla struggled for years to become self-sustainable, and newer startups like Rivian and Lucid have run into plenty of their own roadblocks. We may be able to add Vinfast to that list. In addition to establishing itself as a new brand, it has an added unfamiliarity factor as these electric vehicles are built in Vietnam, at least until Vinfast's factory in North Carolina is up and running.</p>\n<p>The first batch of Vinfasts has now arrived, and we've driven it on the streets north of San Diego.

It's developing a full lineup of electric models, but for now just the VF8 crossover and the larger VF9 SUV are confirmed for these shores, with just the VF8 having arrived so far. Vinfast suffered a bit of a setback with its first batch of US VF8s, however, with disappointing EPA range estimates of just 207 miles (333 km) for the Eco version and 191 miles (307 km) for the Pro model.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938657#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938657&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
