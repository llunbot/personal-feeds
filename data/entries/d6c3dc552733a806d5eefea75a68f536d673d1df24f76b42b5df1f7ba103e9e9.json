{"title":"Eddy Cue in Court, Defending Apple’s Lucrative Search Deal With Google","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23891037/apple-eddy-cue-testimony-us-google","date":1697154727000,"content":"\n<p>David Pierce, reporting for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Eddy Cue, in a dark suit, peered down at the monitor in front of \nhim. The screens in the Washington, DC, courtroom had briefly \nmalfunctioned and left witnesses with only binders, but now the \ntech was up and running — showing an image of three iPhones, each \ndemonstrating a part of the phone’s setup process. Cue squinted \ndown at the screen. </p>\n\n<p>“The resolution on this is terrible,” he said. “You should get a \nMac.” That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet \ncourtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into \nhis microphone and responded, “If Apple would like to make a \ndonation…” That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back \ndown to business. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Genuinely funny, and genuinely an Eddy Cue moment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meagan Bellshaw, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Cue if he \nwould have walked away from the deal if the two sides couldn’t \nagree on a revenue-share figure. Cue said he’d never really \nconsidered that an option: “I always felt like it was in Google’s \nbest interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.” Cue \nalso argued that the deal was about more than economics and that \nApple never seriously considered switching to another provider or \nbuilding its own search product. “Certainly there wasn’t a valid \nalternative to Google at the time,” Cue said. He said there still \nisn’t one. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we get to the heart of the matter. Say what you will about alternatives like Bing and DuckDuckGo (which is powered by Bing results), but they are — I say — at least “valid” alternatives to Google for web search. I’ve been using Kagi — <a href=\"https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/plan-types.html\">a paid search engine with plans starting at $5/month</a> — for about a year and there’s no question in my mind that I’m getting as good or <em>better</em> results than I do from Google for the overwhelming majority of my searches. Apple <em>could</em> switch, quality-wise. Whether they could switch and maintain any semblance of the profits they reap from their deal with Google, I do not know.</p>\n\n<p>So as Google’s search result quality deteriorates — but their ability to monetize their search monopoly remains strong — Apple looks bad too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/12/cue-apple-google\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d6c3dc552733a806d5eefea75a68f536d673d1df24f76b42b5df1f7ba103e9e9","category":"Tech"}
