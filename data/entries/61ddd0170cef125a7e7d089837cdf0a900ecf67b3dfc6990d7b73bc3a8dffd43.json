As a result, we now have a nearly half-century long record of changes to the planet's surfaceâ€”from farms and forests to glaciers and urban areas.</p>\n<p>While the data from the Landsat missions has proved invaluable, it has also been somewhat depressing. The satellites have amassed an impartial record of tropical deforestation in the Amazon, verifying the claims of environmental protection organizations. They have also cataloged increasing water scarcity in the Western United States and chronicled ice losses across the vast majority of Earth's glaciers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798530#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798530&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61ddd0170cef125a7e7d089837cdf0a900ecf67b3dfc6990d7b73bc3a8dffd43","category":"Tech"}
