Nobody knows, but that's what Naomi is there to find out. The place supposedly has an earth-shattering secret that her employers at the <em>Morning Bell</em> want her to uncover—though because she's drowning in debt it's less of a request than a mandate.</p>\n<p>Regardless, in the game's first five minutes, an enigmatic woman in an electric wheelchair gives Naomi a house. Not long after, the <em>Bell</em> has her uploading pictures of the town to an Instagram-esque site, Flamingo, to earn \"emokes\" (likes). Each is worth mere pence on the British pound, a mechanism used to slooowly pay down Naomi's debt. In the next hour, she learns everyone in the town (except the woman) turns into dogs or cats at night—and that it's not the million GBP scoop she thinks it is.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804686#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804686&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"447959dbf0edf34df778d80b052d69c114b4d304f6a7bf027bf176b46b796a24","category":"Tech"}
