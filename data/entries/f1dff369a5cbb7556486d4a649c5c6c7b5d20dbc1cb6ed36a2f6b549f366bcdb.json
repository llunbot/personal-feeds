{"title":"Apple Back to School 2025: When and what is Apple’s back to uni deal?","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html","date":1747992363000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple holds a Back to School promotion every year (now known as the Higher Education Offer to avoid confusion because it’s only open to students once they enter higher education, and the institutions and teachers, not school-age children). As part of the deal, Apple offers an incentive with purchases of qualifying Apple products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s ‘Back to School’ deal runs in various locations around the world during the summer months. The deal usually ends about a month after the first university semester/term begins in that country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in 2025 the offer ran in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/au-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/nz-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/br-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">Brazil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/kr-k12/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">South Korea</a>. Australian and New Zealand students could get AirPods 4 with ANC or Apple Pencil’s for free when they purchased an iPad Pro or iPad Air (Pencil), or a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or iMac (AirPods). The deal ran until March 13, 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next it is the turn of North American students, with Apple’s Back to School promo starting in the U.S. and Canada in mid June. The promotion will start in July for U.K. and European students. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the southern hemisphere giveaway, does it follow that U.S., Canada and U.K students will also get free AirPods and Apple Pencils in the summer of 2025? AirPods were Apple’s student giveaway of choice a few years ago, but in recent times Apple has given away gift cards in those locations, while other European countries got AirPods. Could be moving back to the incentive of free AirPods and Apple Pencil (both of which are popular with students).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out when Apple’s Higher Education giveaway will start where you live and what the deal is likely to include. We also explain who qualifies and how to take advantage of Apple’s education deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Apple’s Back To School offer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>January-March 2025: AirPods or Apple Pencil in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and other southern hemisphere locations. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>June-October 2025: To be confirmed. Previously Apple Gift Cards in U.S., U.K, Canada. AirPods in Europe and India. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years Apple gave away a pair of AirPods with qualifying sales of certain Macs and iPads as part of its education promotion, but in 2022 Apple stopped giving away AirPods in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Australia. Instead, Apple offered gift cards with qualifying purchases during the promotional period. Students could get different gift card denominations depending on the products purchased. Apple also offers gift cards during its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Black Friday shopping event</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Apple switching back to AirPods in the Australian Back to Uni deal for 2025 it is possible that the company will revert back to AirPods later in 2025 when the same promotion is run in the U.S., U.K. and other northern hemisphere locations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t offer the same deal everywhere though. In parts of Europe and India, for the summer of 2024, the promotion allows shoppers to get discounted AirPods or Apple Pencil with qualifying purchases. There was a similar deal in January 2024 where those based in Brazil could claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase in January-March 2024. So Apple has a precedent of offering gift cards to some countries and AirPods and Pencils in others. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 next to iPhone 16 Pro Max\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the only education-related saving Apple offers. Apple doesn’t only offer education-related deals during the summer months. All products sold to students via Apple’s Education Store include a discount all year round, so you can always make a saving on Apple products, as long as you qualify. The summertime education-focused deal is in addition to these year-long discounts Apple offers to students and education institutions. We explain everything you need to know about getting a discount, including how much you can save as a student and how to use Apple’s Education Store, in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">Guide to shopping in the Apple Education Store.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have advice about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670477/best-mac-or-macbook-for-students.html\">Best Mac for Students</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668914/best-ipad-for-students.html\">Best iPad for Students</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Back to School Sale Dates 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Australia, New Zealand, South America, South Korea</strong>: January 8 to March 13 2025.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>U.S. &amp; Canada</strong>: Apple’s Higher Education Offer started on June 20, 2024 and ran until September 30.

Hence, if you live in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Brazil Apple’s deal ran from January 8 to March 13, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same deal runs between June and late September/October in North America, and between July and October in Europe and the U.K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Back to School Sale Australia/New Zealand/South America/South Korea 2025</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>January 8 to March 13, 2025 – Complete</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The dates in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/au-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/nz-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/br-hed/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">Brazil</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/kr-k12/shop/back-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">South Korea</a> correspond with the new school year there.

In 2022 the deal ran from June 24 to September 26, while in 2021 the deal ran from June 17 to September 27.

The deal was the same in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which products are part of Apple’s Education offer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in January 2025 include: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, iPad Pro and iPad Air. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualifying products may differ depending on whether Apple has recently updated them. For example, over Black Friday Apple offers gift cards with select purchases, but its newest products are always left out of the deal. Hence, if Apple has just updated the iPad or Mac you want to buy you may not be able to get the vouchers or other gift alongside your purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in 2024 included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 11- and 13‑inch, iPad Air 11‑ and 13-inch. (In Australia in early 2024 the iPad 10th generation was included, but this wasn’t the case later in 2024). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summer 2023 qualifying purchases included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 12.9‑inch, iPad Pro 11‑inch, and iPad Air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students can also take advantage of a reduced subscription to Apple Music with which they get access to Apple TV+ when they buy an Apple product. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674847/students-can-get-apple-tv-free-with-half-price-apple-music.html\">How to get the student deal for Apple Music and free Apple TV+.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get Apple’s Back To School deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you are based in an area where Apple is running the deal at the time of your purchase, and are a student in higher education, or about to start higher education, you can qualify for Apple’s Higher Education deal and get gift cards with your purchase. There are more details about <a href=\"#who\">who the deal applies to below.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you qualify you are able to get discounts all year round by shopping in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">Apple Education Store,</a> so you don’t need to shop during the Back to Uni deal period to get a bargain.

Employees of these institutions can also qualify. If you are a parent buying for your student offspring then you can also qualify. Here are <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-m1\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Ts&amp;Cs for the U.S</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you are an employee of a public or private K-12 institution/school in the U.S. or Canada you are also eligible. Apple’s Education pricing isn’t available to parents with kids at school, but a homeschool teacher can qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when Apple isn’t running the Back to School Deal students and education institutions can still take advantage of its standard educational pricing on its Educational Pricing page (<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subId1=1-1-673191-1-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-edu%2Fshop\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. here</a> / <a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435298/7615?subId1=1-1-673191-1-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk-edu%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fhome\" target=\"_blank\">U.K. here</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much can you save with Apple’s education pricing? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Students can save up to $200/£220 on Macs and up to $100/£100 on iPads at any time of the year.
