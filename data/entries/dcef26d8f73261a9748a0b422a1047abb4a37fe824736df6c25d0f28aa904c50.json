He bounds between tables, gait like a lazy horse, barely able to see from under the droop of his brow. He poses with customers for photos. He’s the most famous Great Dane in Franschhoek – so famous that the Big Dog Cafe is named after him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, the Big Dog Cafe is a famous spot with local cyclists: safe racking for bikes, a cool canteen-hacienda vibe for patrons and an excellent meeting point for rolling out of town and up the Franschhoek Pass.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

cooked up an A-to-B ride of mixed surfaces that has the promise of being pretty punishing despite being ‘only’ 90 or so kilometres long.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

Better make that two <i>pastel de natas</i> please Jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Storied past</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Western Cape is South Africa’s largest wine region, with its viniculture dating back to Cape Town’s earliest days. Dutch navigator Jan van Riebeeck laid claim to this territory in 1652 and is said to have produced the first wines here in 1659.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towns like Franschhoek abound, the Dutch having welcomed their French neighbours to this new colony on account of their winemaking skills. ‘Franschhoek’ is Dutch for ‘French corner’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride South Africa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Franschhoek Pass climb is still in shadow under the morning sun</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Custard tarts despatched, we grab our bikes and pedal down the main drag, Huguenot Road, named after the French Protestants who fled here when Louis XIV decided he really didn’t want them in France after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The king revoked the Edict of Nantes, issued by Henry IV in 1598, and replaced it with the Edict of Fontainebleau, issued in 1685 and stipulating France was to be solely Catholic, and Huguenot churches should hence be burnt.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a sad truth that violence begets violence and suppression begets suppression, and that it is easier to learn about the history of a place like the Western Cape from the time of its European colonialists onwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not far from here is a bronze statue of Nelson Mandela, fist in the air, commemorating his ‘Long Walk to Freedom’. It is positioned outside Drakenstein Prison (formerly Victor Verster Prison), Mandela’s last place of incarceration before being released on 11th February 1990.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride South Africa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As beautiful as South Africa is, such dichotomies are etched deep into its landscape and are rightly impossible to ignore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such things have also given Franschhoek its somewhat incongruous architecture. The mountains on our horizon are tall and ancient, yet the buildings to our right and left look like two-dimensional facades recently lifted from a Wild West movie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing is over a few storeys, and the frontages are porticoed, balconied and adorned with semi-circular windows. The town is also compact, and Jamie and I soon find ourselves at its limits, on the cusp of the Franschhoek Pass’s slopes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride South Africa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Leaving the urban sprawl long behind, <em>Cyclist</em> traverses the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve en route to the Theewaterskloofdam</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The road turns zebra monochrome as light casts jagged stripes of shadow through the spindly boles of eucalyptus trees. The soil is the sandy-red of exotic places. A troop of baboons lives up to its collective noun by striding officially out of the scrub across our path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie warned me about these, exciting to encounter but to be treated with the utmost caution, especially if they’re carrying young on their backs as several in the group are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily these guys appear used to strangely dressed humans on bikes and pay us little attention, to the point where several plonk themselves in the road and stare wistfully into the distance like wise pensioners with broad noses. We pick our way cautiously around them and soon are back out of the trees and onto a more bald mountain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride South Africa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>We’re going to say this is <em>osteospermum</em>, also known as Sunny Mary</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Looking down, the sprawl of conurbations has been reduced to coloured boxes and the occasional silver flash as the sun hits a distant car window at just the right angle. Up the mountain I can see a lorry languidly making a last turn before it disappears around the hairpin that Jamie says precedes the top. From here I can’t tell – the road and the lorry could literally be dropping off a cliff behind, such is the view obscured by rising rock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I start when I catch a thick, long shape with a trowel-like end lying on the verge. It’s a puff adder. We begin to make a wide arc before Jamie realises the snake has been run over.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Indeed there’s a spatter of blood by its diamond-shaped head. Strange place to have been hit, but Jamie explains that they slide up into car engine bays looking for warmth, then drop out on lay-bys only to get run over as the vehicle makes its exit. And although rare, like a baboon attack, it’s not unheard of for a snake to slither all the way into the footwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coming down the mountain</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We meet up with support driver Kyle at the crest of the pass and agree to see him at the bottom, taking our leave first given that we are the potentially faster vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Descending Franschhoek Pass is mesmeric in both speed and swoopiness.

But this old model is still a venerable steed, and features the same Future Shock 2.0 damping system underneath the stem, offering 20mm of travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it works. The front end smoothes out much of the chatter of hard-pack gravel, although you’ll still feel big hits and this certainly isn’t a suspension unit designed to let you stop cushioning off-road riding with your arms and legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s a good thing because, together with a compliant carbon layup and the CG-R seatpost (designed in that Z-shape to increase flex), the Diverge is noticeably more comfortable than a Specialized Tarmac, for example, but is still absorbing to ride and still retains an aggressive dropbar edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Diverge STR review</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meals for wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The best places, dishes and drinks to replenish hard-spent calories in the Western Cape</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride South Africa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-17.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Franschhoek is the self-styled ‘culinary capital’ of the Western Cape, and places such as the Big Dog Cafe won’t disappoint, with local fare and house-roasted coffee. That said, Stellenbosch has one of the best steak restaurants you could ever hope for, the Fat Butcher, where dinner and wine for four with nothing denied is under £150.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of wineries to tour, and don’t be put off by the word ‘tour’ – locals treat these places more like wine pubs. So pitch up and grab a glass of Pinotage, South Africa’s signature grape, a hybrid of Pinot Noir and Cinsaut cultivated here in 1925 to better survive the arid conditions (OK, wineries <i>will</i> give you the educational spiel if you want).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you go anywhere, go to a farm shop, essentially a cafe-cum-service station serving up local produce. Pies abound, running the gamut of savoury to sweet and vegan to meat, and they are simply incredible. Buy a pie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride South Africa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/big-ride-south-africa-18.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We flew direct with British Airways from Heathrow to Cape Town, although it worked out cheaper to return to Gatwick. Prices in November are around £650 return with 23kg baggage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once in Cape Town we were driven around by Kyle from Cape Vélo Cycling Tours, for while buses, some trains and taxis are available, South Africa is a vast country so your best bet is a guide and support car.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at the Mont Angelis Retreat, self-contained cottages set deep in Stellenbosch wine country that really live up to their ‘luxury accommodation’ billing. Stellenbosch town is 15 minutes away by taxi. Prices start from around £730 for a seven-night stay for two. See <a href=\"https://www.montangelis.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">montangelis.co.za</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vineyards</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No visit to the Western Cape is complete without taking in a few vineyards, and the <a href=\"https://remhoogte.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Remhoogte wine estate</a> at the feet of Simonsberg Mountain is among the best for the ‘turn up and have a few relaxed drinks’ vibe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If arresting views and the full-blown tour experience is what you’re after, try the <a href=\"https://www.waterfordestate.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Waterford Estate</a> on the edge of the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest of thank yous to Jamie Osman, who runs <a href=\"https://capevelo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cape Vélo Cycle Tours</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/coffeeworks.ss\" target=\"_blank\">Coffeeworks</a> in Stellenbosch. Coffeeworks does the best coffee in town (trust us, we tried them all) while Cape Vélo organises all manner of gravel and road rides, from local loops around Stellenbosch’s many trails and national parks to paths less ridden such as the Swartberg Pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks also to Kyle Basson for driving the support car and doling out local wisdom way beyond his years, and to Lucy Osman for letting us borrow her husband for the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 114 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/south-africa-gravel-cycling\">Into the wild: South African gravel ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"dcef26d8f73261a9748a0b422a1047abb4a37fe824736df6c25d0f28aa904c50","category":"Cycling"}
