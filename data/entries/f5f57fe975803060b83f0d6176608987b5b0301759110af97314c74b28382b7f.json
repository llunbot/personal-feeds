During these reviews, engineers also built confidence that even if the leak worsened, it would not add any unacceptable risk for the Starliner test flight to the International Space Station, officials said.</p>\n<p>But engineers also found that an unlikely mix of technical failures in Starliner's propulsion system—representing 0.77 percent of all possible failure modes, according to Boeing's program manager—could prevent the spacecraft from conducting a deorbit burn at the end of the mission.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027053#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027053&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f5f57fe975803060b83f0d6176608987b5b0301759110af97314c74b28382b7f","category":"Tech"}
