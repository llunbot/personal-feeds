Want to know what the next version of macOS will be called? Curious about the versions of Mac OS X that came before? Here we’ll fill you in on the names of the different versions of the Mac operating system in order: from the newest macOS to the first version of Mac OS X and the codenames that Apple used for them. We’ll also show you how you can check which version of macOS you are running and find out what the latest version of macOS is.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the latest macOS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version of macOS is called <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a> after Sequoia National Park located in California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range. That version of macOS launched to the general public in September 2024, following a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">macOS beta program</a> that is still underway as Apple develops more new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version of Sequoia is macOS 15.5, which arrived on May 12, 2025. It includes a Screen Time update, some changes in Mail, and security patches.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">new version of macOS – macOS 16</a> – on the way. We’ll know more after <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> on June 9, 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for help installing macOS read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">How to update macOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671831/macos-wont-install-fixes.html\">Fixes for Macs that won’t update.</a> We can also help with How to install macOS on an unsupported Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is macOS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS is the Mac operating system, like iOS is the iPhone operating system and iPadOS is the iPad operating system. It’s the software that runs in the background, providing the user interface and providing the link between the hardware and software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Macs run macOS, previously known as Mac OS X, and have done so since the introduction of the first version of Mac OS X in 2001. Before that, Macs ran Mac OS 9 which came out in October 1999 and received updates until December 2001. Mac OS X was based on technology from NeXT Computer, which was another company founded by Steve Jobs. Jobs brought the technology back to Apple with him when he was reinstated as Apple CEO. The operating system is Unix-based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mac OS X was launched more than two decades ago on March 24, 2001. There’s been a lot of change over those two decades: good and bad. From the problems with the first edition (it was slow and didn’t run important apps like Microsoft Word) Mac OS X has evolved through various iterations and various designs to what we know today. We’ve seen tight integration with iOS devices, the incorporation of the cloud, and the arrival of excellent and helpful features including integrated Time Machine backups, Quick Look – which lets you see a preview of a document without opening the application, and innovations like Expose and Spaces and Desktop Stacks to help you work more efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an overview of the features of the various versions of the Mac operating system, showing how it has developed over time, take a look at our video above. If you want to know the names Apple assigned to Mac OS X over the years, and the codenames that were used internally, read on.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS versions in order</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s an overview of every version of macOS and Mac OS X Apple has released.

But while the public-facing builds were named after big cats, internally, they were named after wines (aside from OS X 10.6 which had no codename).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after Apple switched public-facing code names to places in California back in 2013, it carried on naming them after wines internally until 2014. In 2015, Apple decided to change the theme of internal code names from wines to types of apples. Original.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Apple took the plunge to unify the branding of its operating systems by rebranding Mac OS X to macOS, which sits nicely alongside iOS, tvOS, and watchOS and paved the way for macOS 11, the successor to Mac OS X, which arrived twenty years after the first beta of Mac OS X.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which versions of macOS are still updated?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple still supplies regular features and security updates to the most recent version of macOS. Right now this is Sequoia, also known as macOS 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous two versions of macOS also receive security updates and bug fixes. <span>If you are running macOS 14 Sonoma or macOS 13 Ventura </span>you will still get security updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the arrival of Sequoia, Apple no longer supports macOS 12 Monterey which arrived in 2021 (and with the arrival of Sonoma in 2023 it stopped support for macOS Big Sur, which arrived in 2020). See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html\">How long do Macs and MacBooks last?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also issues updates to its Safari web browser. The latest version of Safari for Mac is Safari 18 (as of September 2024) and it requires Ventura, Sonoma or Sequoia.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ventura-download.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Ventura download Mac\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ventura-download.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ventura-download.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ventura-download.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ventura-download.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to tell which macOS version you are running</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can tell which version of macOS you are running by clicking on the Apple logo in the top left and choosing About This Mac.

Since the arrival of the Mac App Store in 2011 (as an update to Snow Leopard) versions of Mac OS X and macOS have been available to download via the Mac App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that changed with Mojave, which arrived in 2018. Now operating system updates come in via Software Updates which is either located in System Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update or in System Preferences &gt; Software Update (pre-Ventura). One of the benefits of this is that your Mac can be set to automatically download the latest updates and install them, keeping your Mac up-to-date with minimum effort on your part. Incidentally, you can still find the macOS software on the Mac App Store. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Macs will be set to update macOS automatically. If you want your Mac to update automatically follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ventura or later: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>General</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the “i” beside Automatic Updates and make sure that <em>Check for updates</em>, <em>Download new updates when available</em>, and <em>Install macOS updates</em> are selected. This way your Mac will automatically update to the latest version. If you would prefer not to have your Mac do this automatically you can deselect these options. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In Monterey, Big Sur, Mojave, or Catalina:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Preferences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check the box beside <em>Automatically keep my Mac up to date</em> (or <em>Download new updates when available</em>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now select the box <em>Install macOS updates</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In High Sierra or earlier:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Preferences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>App Store</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check the box beside <em>Automatically check for updates</em> – it should have a tick in it as should the four options below that…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now deselect the box beside <em>Download newly available updates in the background</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Read all about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos-update-to-monterey.html\">how to update your Mac here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a list of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1659017/ios-versions-list.html\">every version of iOS</a> where you can see the latest versions and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675021/how-long-does-apple-support-iphones.html\">how long Apple supports iPhones for</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a3f860dd99addf0b6faa52e438d6a9ffa442f49b46dcb5536a445022a2a84c6f","category":"Apple"}
