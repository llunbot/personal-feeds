In \"an unprompted Tuesday email\" to NPR reporter Bobby Allyn, Musk wrote, \"So is NPR going to start posting on Twitter again, or should we reassign @NPR to another company?\" according to an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/02/1173422311/elon-musk-npr-twitter-reassign\">NPR news article by Allyn</a>.</p>\n<p>Allyn pointed out that reassigning NPR's account solely for not tweeting would contradict <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts\">Twitter's inactive account policy</a>, which says that inactivity \"is based on logging in,\" not on posting tweets. While accounts \"may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity,\" Twitter's policy says that users can keep their accounts active simply by logging in at least once every 30 days.</p>\n<p>\"Musk did not answer when asked whether he planned to change the platform's definition of inactivity and he declined to say what prompted his new questions about NPR's lack of participation on Twitter,\" Allyn wrote.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936320#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936320&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd1b95639c121e195e8d7ce5976f24436eb16d3029f0f856b54172df3938f9ed","category":"Tech"}
