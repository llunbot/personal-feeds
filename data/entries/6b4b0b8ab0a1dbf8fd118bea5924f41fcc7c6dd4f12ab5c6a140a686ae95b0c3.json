The new update comes a week after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-releases-third-beta-of-visionos-1-1/\">release of the third beta</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Home-Screen.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌visionOS‌ beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌visionOS‌ 1.1 brings support for iMessage Contact Key Verification and it adds Apple device management to the Vision Pro. With this functionality, IT departments at companies and educational institutions can manage Vision Pro headsets in the same way they manage iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Apple's beta notes, users can now reposition volumetric scenes closer than before, enabling easier direct interaction with the volumetric scene content. That means objects can be placed closer to you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also improved Personas in ‌visionOS‌ 1.1, making them look more natural and lifelike than before. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-releases-visionos-1-1-beta-4/\">Apple Releases visionOS 1.1 Beta 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-1-beta-4.2420567/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b4b0b8ab0a1dbf8fd118bea5924f41fcc7c6dd4f12ab5c6a140a686ae95b0c3","category":"Apple"}
