Google has been gearing up on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/after-a-one-year-delay-google-might-finally-launch-its-find-my-network/\">the software side</a> of things to enable a Bluetooth tracking network on Android, and the company's two tracking tag hardware partners, Pebblebee and Chipolo, now have ship dates. The two companies each have a press release today, with Pebblebee saying its trackers will ship in \"late May,\" while Chipolo says it will ship \"after May 27th.\" Google has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/\">a blog post</a> out, too, promising \"additional Bluetooth tags from Eufy, Jio, Motorola and more\" later this year.</p>\n<p>Both sets of devices have been up for preorder for a year now, and it doesn't seem like anything has changed since. Both companies are offering little Bluetooth trackers in a keychain tag or credit card format, and Pebblebee has a third stick-on tag format. They'll all be anonymously tracked by Android's 3 billion-device Bluetooth tracker network, and the device owner will be able to see them in Google's \"Find my device\" app.</p>\n<p>Chipolo's \"One Point\" key chain tag is the only thing that takes a CR2032 coin cell battery, while the company's credit card tracker is not rechargeable. Pebblebee's key chain, credit card, and stick-on tracker <em>all</em> have rechargeable batteries, including the wallet card, which is very rare! Nothing has UWB for precise location tracking—everything uses a speaker. Both companies sell multiple SKUs of what look like the exact same product but are locked to Google's or Apple's network—no switching allowed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015402#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015402&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"48b8ee7b7f3b2c6dfc1487278d72d5bb12dbcf2b27eb763d2eccbb29f6fd922a","category":"Tech"}
