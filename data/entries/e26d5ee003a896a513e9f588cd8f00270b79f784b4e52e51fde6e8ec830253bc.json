If its mission operators decide to proceed, the landing attempt will begin as soon as 11:40 am ET on Tuesday (15:40 UTC). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpR1UUnix3g\">It will be livestreamed</a>.</p>\n<p>The landing attempt will start from an altitude of about 100 km above the lunar surface, where the spacecraft is presently in a circular orbit. It will begin with a braking maneuver by a firing of the spacecraft's main engine, to be followed by a pre-programmed set of commands during which the lander will adjust its attitude with respect to the Moon's surface and decelerate to make a soft landing. The process should take about an hour.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933838#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e26d5ee003a896a513e9f588cd8f00270b79f784b4e52e51fde6e8ec830253bc","category":"Tech"}
