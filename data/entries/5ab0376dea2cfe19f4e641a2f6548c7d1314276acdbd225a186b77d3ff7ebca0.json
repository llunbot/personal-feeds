At the same time, it has rationalised the models available and added multiple spindle length options for the Xpro pedal range. There’s no pedal power meter planned yet though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for the five-model Time Xpro/Xpresso road pedal range are from £65 for the Xpresso 4 up to £440 for the Xpro 12 SL. The three Atac gravel pedal models are priced from £90 for the Atac XC 6 to £295 for the Atac XC 12.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-tech-gallery-2024\">Paris-Roubaix tech gallery: Sticky bar tape, Pirelli prototypes and big tyres</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\">All the WorldTour team bikes, tech and kit 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">Best road bike pedals 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/how-to-choose-road-bike-pedals\">How to choose road bike pedals</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Increased profile in the pro peloton</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Time was a big name in the pedal market back in the day, with its road pedals popular in the pro peloton. The Time pedal business was bought by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM </a>in 2021, which is now looking to increase Time pedals’ profile with the buying public with an overhaul of the pedal models and features and increased usage by the pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dominant <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/sd-worx\" target=\"_blank\">SD Worx</a> women’s pro team has been riding on Time Xpro pedals for six years and its pedals are also used by the women of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/canyon-sram\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon-SRAM</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM is a major sponsor of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> men’s and women’s teams, who are in their second season using Time Xpro pedals, while both male and female <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/movistar\" target=\"_blank\">Movistar </a>teams have switched to Time pedals this year, having trialled them on a limited basis last season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also a number of gravel racers using Time Atac XC pedals, including Nico Roche. Kasia Niewiadoma won the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gravel-world-championships-2023-gallery-tech\" target=\"_blank\">2023 Gravel World Championships</a> on Time Xpro road pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated road pedal range with multiple stance widths</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-970x644.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-970x644.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-768x510.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-1536x1020.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-2048x1360.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-750x498.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-1140x757.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Time-Xpro15-Sl-side-view-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Time road pedal range uses the iClic system, which includes a lever to keep the mechanism open until the cleat is engaged, making for easier clip-in than other road pedal systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The retainer uses a carbon blade spring, similar to the system used by the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/look-keo-blade-pedals-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Look Keo Blade </a>pedals, which in both designs can be swapped out for a stronger one if preferred. New is a three position spring tension adjustment mechanism in the pedal body, which allows you to change the release force without needing to swap the blade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time has also added multiple pedal spindle length options for its pedals, allowing you to alter your stance width. There are three spindle lengths for the new Xpro pedal range: 51mm, 53mm and 57mm. In addition, the Time road cleats are asymmetric and by swapping them between shoes you can change the shoe stance width by an additional +/-1.5mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time’s offer of multiple spindle lengths across its full Xpro range is unique, as Shimano only offers two spindle lengths for its Dura-Ace and Ultegra pedals, while Wahoo Speedplay offers four spindle lengths for its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-speedplay-zero-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">Speedplay Zero</a> pedals only and Look only has a single spindle length available for its entire pedal range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time has also rationalised its road pedal range, with the Xpro available at 10, 12 and 12SL specs. The Xpro 12SL is the new equivalent of the previous Xpro 15. It has a titanium axle and ceramic bearings and Time claims a 259g a set weight, including the cleats. It’s the only pedal in Time’s range with a rider weight restriction – 90kg. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/time-xpro-10-review\" target=\"_blank\">Xpro 10</a> is light at a claimed 310g a pair for the pedals and cleats, not far off <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-pd-r9100-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Dura-Ace</a> at 306g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have also been minor cosmetic changes to the Xpro range. The new pedals use long fibre carbon rather than the old models’ short fibre. Why? Because it looks nicer as you can see the fibres, Time says. Spindles on top spec models are now gold plated instead of silver and there’s new pedal artwork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time is keeping the lower spec <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/time-xpresso-7-review\" target=\"_blank\">Xpresso pedals</a> in its range with unchanged tech and glass fibre composite pedal bodies, but now named 6 and 4. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also introducing a pedal service kit for the Xpro, which allows you to replace the components in the pedal body, although its bearings remain non-user serviceable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Time Xpro 12 SL</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 87g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 259g </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £440.00 | €490.00 | $440.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Time Xpro 12</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 94g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 273g </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £305.00 | €340.00 | $305.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Time Xpro 10</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 113g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 310g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £160.00 | €180.00 | $160.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Time Xpresso 6</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 115g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 315g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £95.00 | €105.00 | $95.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Time Xpresso 4</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 115g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 315g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £65.00 | €70.00 | $65.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updates to the Atac gravel/XC pedal range</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-970x650.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-970x650.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-768x514.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-1536x1029.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-2048x1371.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-750x502.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Tima-Atac-XC12-pedal-1140x763.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Time has retained its patented Atac system for its gravel and XC mountain bike pedal range. It has the moving retainer mounted at the front of the pedal rather than the rear, which Time says makes for more natural engagement and also helps to clear the cleat and retainer of debris when clipping in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Time Atac pedal range will now consist of the Atac 6, 10 and 12, with the Atac 12 boasting a titanium spindle and carbon body for a claimed weight of 285g a pair, including cleats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system is available with standard and Easy cleats. The standard cleats can be swapped between shoes, which provides either a 13 degree or 17 degree release angle, while the Easy cleats have a 10 degree release angle. As with the Xpro road pedals, you can adjust the pedal release tension, with three different positions for the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time is introducing a shoe shield for its MTB pedals, which sits under the cleat and is designed to reduce wear on the shoe’s sole.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Time Atac XC 12</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 120g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 285g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £295.00 | €330.00 | $295.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4> Time Atac XC 10</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 140g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 325g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £150.00 | €165.00 | $150.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Time Atac XC 6</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pedal weight per pedal: 150g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pedal pair weight incl cleats: 345g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: £90.00 | €100.00 | $90.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>No power meter planned</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Time says that it’s not working on a pedal <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">power meter</a> to match those offered by several of its competitors, now including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/look-power-meter-pedals-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Look </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wahoo-powrlink-zero-pedals-kickr-rollr-trainer\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo/Speedplay</a>, as well as other brands such as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/favero-assioma-duo-shi-power-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">Favero </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-rally-power-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It reckons that with Quarq in SRAM’s stable and the increasing number of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM groupsets</a> with integrated crank power meters, a Time pedal power meter isn’t a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">best road bike pedals</a>, with links to individual pedal reviews.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/time-pedals-2024\">Time revamps its road and gravel pedal ranges</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5ab0376dea2cfe19f4e641a2f6548c7d1314276acdbd225a186b77d3ff7ebca0","category":"Cycling"}
