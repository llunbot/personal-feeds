After a brief hiatus while <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/kona-bicycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Kona</a> rebuilt things from the ground up, the KRO is officially live again—now fully integrated into <a href=\"https://konaworld.com\" target=\"_blank\">konaworld.com.</a> That means you don’t have to go very far to finally click “TAKE MY MONEY!” on that bike you’ve been geeking out over on your lunch break. The Kona Ride Online gives you access to the widest selection of Kona bikes available, all from the comfort of your mobile device or laptop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-63.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-63.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-63.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-63.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>What about local dealers? Well, here’s the best part about the KRO. You’re not buying from some faraway warehouse — you’re supporting your local Kona dealer of choice. That means you get full after-purchase care and the satisfaction of keeping your hard-earned cash flowing into the brick-and-mortar shop that runs weekly group rides, hosts community trail days, and helps groms become grease monkeys.</p>\n<div>PLUS! When you pick up your bike, it’ll be completely <strong>ready to roll </strong>— no zip ties to cut, no Allen keys to unpack, just show up and ride out.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More of this, please, from the bike industry! Your local bike shop needs your help now more than ever.</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kona-kro-helps-out-local-dealers/\">Kona Redesigned KRO Helps Out Local Dealers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"de380d4f9f8d9f2e4da056ae78505db00c196641ec901c55ae11cefd7a4dc9dc","category":"Cycling"}
