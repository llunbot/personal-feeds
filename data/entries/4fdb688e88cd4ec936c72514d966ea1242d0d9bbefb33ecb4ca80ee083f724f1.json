After launching the Plasmatic colorway this morning, WTC tells us that they were sold out in about 22 minutes. The previous <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/titanium-rainbow-limited-edition-wtc-morse-cage-ti-bottle-cage/\" target=\"_blank\">limited edition</a> batches went quick, but it seems that the tie-dye-esque Plasmatic anodized finish made riders snatch them up faster than ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Morse-Ti-Cages_Limited_Plasmatic_2.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed out on the first batch of the Plastmatic cages, well, you missed out. WTC says they wonâ€™t recreate this exact color but you may see a similar finish in different colors in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, WTC still has the Morse Cage Ti offered in raw titanium, black, or gold on a regular basis. The cages weigh in at 33g and offer 32mm of vertical adjustment thanks to the Morse dot-dash mounting pattern. The sold-out-Plasmatic versions sold for $89.95, which is the same as the gold cages. Black is a little less at $84.95, and the standard titanium-colored cage sells for $69.95. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/limited-edition-wtc-morse-cage-ti-plasmatic/\">Newest Limited Edition WTC Morse Cage Ti Sold Out in 22 Minutes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4fdb688e88cd4ec936c72514d966ea1242d0d9bbefb33ecb4ca80ee083f724f1","category":"Cycling"}
