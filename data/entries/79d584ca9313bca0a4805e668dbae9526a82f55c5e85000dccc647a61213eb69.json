Translucent casings are sometimes used for prototypes to allow engineers to see directly into the device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been known to use translucent casings for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/06/prototype-apple-macintosh/\">prototypes dating back to the Macintosh Classic</a>. Other Apple device prototypes, such as for the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-macs-have-you-always-wanted.704613/page-9?post=9592409#post-9592409\">Macintosh Portable</a> and <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/transparent-case-newton.2191457/\">Newton</a> have emerged over the years, but this is the first time that the striking translucent casing has been seen on an Apple device as recent and as compact as AirPods.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nObservers may perceive some coincidental similarities between these prototype AirPods and the design of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-take-on-airpods-pro/\">Nothing's \"Ear (1)\" true wireless earbuds</a>, which are positioned as a low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> competitor.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast week, Zompetti shared images of a prototype Apple 29W charger with a translucent casing. The 29W power adapter came with the 12-inch MacBook, but was discontinued with that machine in 2018 and replaced with a 30W adapter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>29W Apple Charger prototype. <a href=\"https://t.co/h2ZoHCMw0F\">pic.twitter.com/h2ZoHCMw0F</a></p>â€” Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 23, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nZompetti is an avid collector of Apple prototype devices and has previously shared images of an Apple Watch Series 3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/apple-watch-prototype-may-show-smart-band-contacts/\">prototype with additional connectors</a>, an original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-planned-ipad-with-two-ports/\">with two 30-pin ports</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/iphone-12-pro-prototype-photos/\">iPhone 12 Pro prototype</a>, a third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/\">iPod touch</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/27/prototype-third-gen-ipod-touch/\">with a rear camera</a>, rare <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/14/original-apple-watch-prototypes/\">original Apple Watch prototypes</a>, and most notably, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/working-airpower-prototype-shown-in-video-clip/\">working AirPower prototype</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/30/translucent-airpods-and-29w-adapter-prototypes/\">Translucent AirPods and 29W Power Adapter Prototypes Surface in Photos</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/translucent-airpods-and-29w-power-adapter-prototypes-surface-in-photos.2325620/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WnHq2v8TkR8:OfeqGhjCoD4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WnHq2v8TkR8:OfeqGhjCoD4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"79d584ca9313bca0a4805e668dbae9526a82f55c5e85000dccc647a61213eb69","category":"Apple"}
