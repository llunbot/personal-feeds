Like my Specialized, it’s a full custom build that you likely won’t see anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Now discontinued, the GAN K was the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes/\">endurance road bike</a> in Pinarello’s range, taking clear inspiration from the then range-topping <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/pinarello-dogma-f8-sky-di2-review/\">Dogma F8</a> ridden to victory by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bradley-wiggins-custom-pinarello-dogma-f8/\">Bradley Wiggins</a>. However, its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">geometry</a> is more relaxed and it sports a beefier clearance for 28mm tyres (with plenty of room to spare).</p>\n<p>Of course, being a Pinarello, the frame has the brand’s signature asymmetric design and its tube shapes are aerodynamically optimised. The GAN K also features the brand’s signature Onda fork, with its wave profile designed to increase compliance.</p>\n<p>The GAN K has since been replaced by the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-pinarello-prince-paris/\">Prince</a> and, more recently, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-f-series/\">F-Series</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-x-series/\">X-Series</a> bikes.</p>\n<p>Although I’ve only clocked up 1,500km on the bike so far, it offers a comfortable and surprisingly fast ride. I’m looking forward to more rides on it in the coming weeks and months.</p>\n<h2>A languorous build process</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It took me a while to plan the final spec.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>I bought the frame in March 2020 when I worked at Carbon Bike Repair, a few weeks prior to the first UK Coronavirus lockdown.</p>\n<p>Pinarello UK was having a clear-out of frames to make way for the new Prince model at the time.

BikeRadar.</p>\n<p>In the Carbon Bike Repair workshop, we were convinced there was a mischievous ghost because very few frames would be rebuilt back into a complete bike successfully in one sitting.</p>\n<p>There’d always be a missing, worn or broken part, or something spendy such as a Campagnolo EPS rear derailleur would suddenly decide to give the dreaded beep of death.</p>\n<p>Well, the ghost got me good and proper with this build.</p>\n<p>After getting through the majority of the build (the only major hurdle being the mundane task of routing the cables and hoses around the Italian threaded bottom bracket sleeve), I went to bleed the rear brake and oil leaked out of the lever.</p>\n<p>Following a back and forth with the UK distributor, a faulty master cylinder was diagnosed and, by April, the bike was built up with a replacement and ready for action.</p>\n<h2>How does it ride?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A ‘Brill’ maiden voyage on the GAN K.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The finished product was worth the painstaking build process – the GAN K offers a really exciting ride with nimble handling and is surprisingly fast.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting I was between sizes and I opted for the 53cm to achieve a slightly racier position (I’m 5ft 11in).</p>\n<p>Pinarello’s racing pedigree is still very evident in this frame and the bike feels efficient in all scenarios, but not stiff-as-a-board like some of its older halo options.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the wheels play a large role in the bike’s riding characteristics and it will be interesting to see how it changes with a less exotic wheelset.</p>\n<p>The bike’s quick handling requires a fair amount of rider input on descents, but it smooths out ruts and bumps solidly.</p>\n<p>It’s not as comfortable as my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/look-765-optimum-long-term-review/\">Look 765 Optimum long-term test bike</a>, which has blown me away, but it’s still an efficient

Its maiden voyage was a 123km ride to Brill, a quaint village with a windmill at the top of a hill, overlooking a panoramic view of Oxfordshire.</p>\n<p>It’s served me well and turned heads on various club rides. The longest ride I’ve used the bike on so far was a 215km epic in preparation for an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/audax/\">audax</a> and I felt comfortable throughout.</p>\n<p>I’d have no reservations about using this for some of the longer audaxes I plan to ride this year.</p>\n<h2>Probably the best mechanical groupset, ever</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/DSC00137-145034d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Record 12 shifters on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Campagnolo Record 12 shifters on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Record levers are a wonderful place to perch my hands. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/DSC00139-96d67e4.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Record 12 shifters on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Campagnolo Record 12 shifters on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>I love the ability to down-shift up to 5 gears at a time. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/DSC00134-cf85f6d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Record 12 rear derailleur on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Campagnolo Record 12 rear derailleur on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There’s a reassuring ‘Ker-Clunk’ when you change gear. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/DSC00164-335dc55.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Record 12 brakes on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Campagnolo Record 12 brakes on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The brakes are my favourite of the Big Three. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/DSC00162-2b4b800.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Record crankset and bottom bracket on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Campagnolo Record crankset and bottom bracket on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Record cranks spin on an Italian threaded bottom bracket. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>I’ve already covered my detailed opinions on Campagnolo Record 12 in my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/oscar-huckle-gear-of-the-year-2022/\">Gear of the Year</a> entry, but in short, the shifting is brilliantly precise with excellent lever ergonomics.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo’s hydraulic disc brakes are my favourite of the Big Three, too, offering unrivalled modulation and feel.</p>\n<p>Record doesn’t have its own namesake <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-chains/\">chain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassette</a>, so I opted for the Chorus-level options rather than Super-Record.

The upper bearing and cover didn’t quite sit optimally, so I’ve had to make do with an FSA alternative instead.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I’d prefer a conventional post and clamp, but this setup hasn’t caused me an issue so far.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a> is Pinarello’s own proprietary aero offering – I’d prefer a round post, but this seems to cushion the ride well and hasn’t caused me any functional problems yet.</p>\n<p>I’m using a Fizik Aliante saddle, another spare I had that was used on my old <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/trek-emonda-sl-6-review/\">Trek Émonda SL</a>.

It’s refreshing to come back to a bike that offers a less inhibited riding characteristic, and the Record 12 groupset puts a giddy smile on my face.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"7b08c208513dc37e24bc2e7fb7b691ff3070458ea4602674aa0eab44a1e71fcb","category":"Cycling"}
