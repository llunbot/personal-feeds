{"title":"A Brief Chat With Fired ‘#AppleToo’ Organizer, That Is So Brief That It Doesn’t Ask the One Question Begging to Be Asked","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729072/apple-too-organizer-janneke-parrish-interview","date":1634409082000,"content":"\n<p>Zoe Schiffer, writing for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On October 14th, Apple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement\">fired a leader of the #AppleToo\nmovement</a> for allegedly failing to comply with an internal\ninvestigation. The employee, Janneke Parrish, has been working\nbehind the scenes for months to organize fellow employees who’ve\nfaced harassment and discrimination. […]</p>\n\n<p>Q: <em>What’s your view on why you were fired?</em></p>\n\n<p>I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out, for my work\nwith #AppleToo, and out of concern that I was organizing to help\nother employees tell their stories. In my view, this is entirely\nretaliation for trying to bring Apple’s actions to light and\npublicly asking the company to do better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unasked in the interview: whether Parrish actually leaked confidential company information. That seems pertinent when the stated reason for her firing was suspicion of leaking confidential company information.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/16/parrish-question\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ef222331412658097f3658de3c554ce1b60b06ac21cd8c36160ce84bf4083a8b","category":"Tech"}
