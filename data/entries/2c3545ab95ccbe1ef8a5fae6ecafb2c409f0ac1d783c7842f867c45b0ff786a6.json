The searches also turned up drugs and other stolen goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bikes were stolen last Friday from a team van in a hotel parking area in Lille, France. The Italian track team had reportedly opted for a hotel with a private parking area due to security concerns, but that evidently did not stop thieves from stealing the bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six days later, police reportedly caught suspects trying to sell the bikes, and multiple people are now in custody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the stolen bikes were valued at roughly €600,000.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/romanian-police-find-bikes-stolen-from-italian-track-team/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2c3545ab95ccbe1ef8a5fae6ecafb2c409f0ac1d783c7842f867c45b0ff786a6","category":"Cycling"}
