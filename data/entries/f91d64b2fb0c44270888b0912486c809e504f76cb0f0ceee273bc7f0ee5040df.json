In the document, Apple says that High Power Mode will provide users with \"extreme performance\" for tasks like color grading 8K ProRes video.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's still unclear exactly how High Power Mode will function, but we should get a closer look at the feature next week when reviews of the new MacBook Pro models are shared. Based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macos-monterey-high-power-mode/\">code-level references to High Power Mode</a> in the macOS Monterey beta found by MacRumors contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevemoser\">Steve Moser</a>, we do know that the feature \"will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks\" and \"may result in louder fan noise.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple only confirmed High Power Mode being available on 16-inch MacBook Pro models with an M1 Max chip, so we presume the feature is not available on any 14-inch MacBook Pro models or any models configured with the M1 Pro chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>9to5Mac</em>'s Filipe Esp√≥sito was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/high-power-mode-for-macs-macos-monterey-beta-8/\">first to discover</a> references to High Power Mode in the macOS Monterey beta last month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two configurations of the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip available, including one with a 10-core CPU and a 24-core GPU and another with a 10-core CPU and a 32-core GPU. Pricing starts at $3,099 for this level of performance. The new MacBook Pro models will begin arriving to customers on Tuesday, October 26.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/high-power-mode/\">High Power Mode</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/high-power-mode-16-inch-macbook-pro-m1-max/\">Apple Says High Power Mode on 16-Inch MacBook Pro With M1 Max Designed for Tasks Like Color Grading 8K ProRes Video</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-high-power-mode-on-16-inch-macbook-pro-with-m1-max-designed-for-tasks-like-color-grading-8k-prores-video.2318648/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DaaL_-lvhG4:wPFFjr1WJ5A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DaaL_-lvhG4:wPFFjr1WJ5A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DaaL_-lvhG4\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f91d64b2fb0c44270888b0912486c809e504f76cb0f0ceee273bc7f0ee5040df","category":"Apple"}
