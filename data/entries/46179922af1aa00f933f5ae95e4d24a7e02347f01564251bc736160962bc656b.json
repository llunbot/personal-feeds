{"title":"AirPods vs the best wireless headphones for iPhone","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/668628/best-wireless-headphones.html","date":1690296119000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireless headphones are essentially the standard now, with Bluetooth not only being convenient but Apple removing the audio jack on the iPhone range. For most people, the sound quality difference to wired isn’t noticeable anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is huge, but here are the best wireless headphones we’ve tested for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Macs. If you do want a wired connection some of these do offer it in addition to Bluetooth, but we also have a round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668694/best-lightning-headphones-for-iphone-ipad.html\">best wired headphones</a> and a comparison of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/201379/best-over-ear-headphones-airpods-max-vs-the-competition.html\">AirPods Max vs other over-ear headphones</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you’re wondering why the AirPods Max don’t appear on this list, rest assured that we gave them due consideration – but while audio quality is exceptional, their very high price and ill-judged case design kept them out of this competitive chart.

However, its latest Momentum True Wireless 3 (TW3) earbuds have a more compact and comfortable design than their predecessors, while still providing excellent sound quality and noise-cancellation features for a competitive $279.95/£229.99.</p>\n\n<p>It’s good to see that not all companies copy the design of Apple’s AirPods, and the TW3 earbuds have a distinctive lozenge shape that allows you to twist the earpieces inside your ear to get a good fit. Some people may not like this, but I definitely found that the earpieces fit more firmly than the AirPods, and there are three sets of ear-tips provided in different sizes as well. The earpieces are rated IPX4 for water resistance, so they’ll be able to cope with some rain when you’re out jogging, and we also like the fabric cover on the sturdy little charging case.</p>\n\n<p>Sound quality is excellent, with the TW3 supporting both Apple’s AAC codec and aptX Adaptive for Android devices. The TW3 boasts a frequency response of 5Hz – 21KHz, and that low-end 5Hz works a treat on Billie Eilish’s You Should See Me In A Crown, where the juddering bass pulse sounds really deep and threatening. The TW3 is a little louder than many of its rivals too, so it’ll be a good choice if you want some loud music for your workout sessions. It’s not all bass overload, though, and the TW3 shows a really delicate touch on Arvo Pärt’s Spiegel Im Spiegel, as the slow, wistful violin melody lingers lightly in the air.</p>\n\n<p>Pärt’s delicate melody also provides a good test of the TW3’s noise-cancellation features, which do an impressive job at blocking out background noise so that I can wallow in the track’s melancholy mood on a rainy summer afternoon. And, to top it all off, the TW3 provides good battery life too, lasting for seven hours on a single charge – or 6.5 hours when using noise-cancellation – while the charging case lets you fully recharge three more times when you’re on a long journey.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

We found the extra small tips more comfortable, your experience may differ. </p>\n\n<p>The charging case now comes with a small metal lanyard loop – although Apple doesn’t actually sell a lanyard. There are speaker holes a the base of the case that can make a sound if you lose the AirPods while they are in their case. </p>\n\n<p>The original AirPods Pro lacked an easy way to control volume, so the fact that the second-gen model adds the ability to detect up and down swipes on the little flat area of the stem is useful. A swipe up or down changes the volume. </p>\n\n<p>As for what’s inside, the H2 chip in the 2022 AirPods Pro enables Adaptive Transparency, which is an enhancement of the Transparency mode on the original model. As a result of this mode you can choose to hear things that you might need be able to hear in your vicinity, but you won’t be deafened by them. In our tests the AirPods Pro 2 blocked more outside sound than the originals.</p>\n\n<p>We were impressed by how much better the new second-generation AirPods Pro sound compared to the first generation. Clarity and sharpness is improved and bass response is vastly improved. The bridge of the Beastie Boys’ “Intergalactic” at 2:30 was just way too much for the old AirPods Pro to handle, but the new model had no trouble keeping up.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673509/how-to-improve-airpods-battery-life.html\">battery life</a> is longer than it was for the original AirPods Pro and you can now use your Apple Watch charger in addition to charging via Lightning and other wireless charging methods. </p>\n\n<p>As with the iPhone 14-series and the 2022 Apple Watches, Bluetooth 5.3 is supported, however, it doesn’t appear that it’s being used for anything in particular right now. Perhaps a software update will bring new features in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Like the originals the AirPods Pro 2 offer Spatial Audio with head tracking, Conversation Boost to amplify speech in the direction you’re facing, one-tap pairing, audio sharing with another pair of AirPods (or Beats), quick switching to other Apple devices your Apple ID is logged into, and hands-free Siri.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2022-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

They are available in black and ivory too.</p>\n\n<p>The charging case is a bit larger than that of AirPods or AirPods Pro. There’s a USB-C charge port, but no wireless charging. </p>\n\n<p>The buds are average in size and fit and come with four sizes of eartips, so it’s easy to get a good seal, although in our testing we did lose the seal a couple of times while working out at the gym. </p>\n\n<p>There are actual physical buttons on the side of each earbud, which we found to be easier to use than Apple’s “squeeze the stem” AirPods control system. </p>\n\n<p>Beats says that these earbuds offer 1.6x better noise canceling and 2x better transparency than their predecessors. They still don’t match the AirPods Pro, but they are priced closer to the standard AirPods, which don’t even offer those features. The transparency feature isn’t adaptive. </p>\n\n<p>These second-gen earbuds offer improved ventilation and bigger batteries than the predecessors (battery life is rated at six hours with ANC, or nine without). Sound quality is also better than that of the previous generation thanks to new microphones and transducers. They sound better than 3rd-gen AirPods, but the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro deliver an overall superior audio experience all around.  </p>\n\n<p>Some Beats products use Apple’s own headphone chips, but the Beats Studio Buds + do not. Because they lack Apple’s H1 or H2 chip, they miss out on many of the features of Apple’s ecosystem. Hands-free “Hey Siri” is there, as is instant pairing with your iPhone and support for the Find My app. But you don’t get instant switching between Apple devices, support for spatial audio with video, personalized spatial audio, Conversation Boost, or the in-ear detection that pauses playback if you take an earbud out. Instead, these buds support some Android features including Google Fast Pair, Audio Switch, and Find My Device. Surprising from a company owned by Apple.  </p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed the design and usability of these Beats earbuds, and I’d take them over the AirPods any day, but I still find the latest AirPods Pro easier to recommend.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1937710/beats-studio-buds-plus.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeats Studio Buds+ review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.

They’re sturdy too, with an IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, so they’ll be a good option for exercise as well as traveling. </p>\n\n<p>The earbuds support both Apple’s AAC and the aptX Adaptive codec for Bluetooth audio, so they’ll work with a variety of computers and mobile devices. However, B&amp;W has come up with an ingenious smart charging case that makes the Pi7 S2 even more versatile. The charging case has a USB-C port for charging – and also supports Qi wireless charging too – but the USB-C port can also accept a wired audio input as well. There are USB-C and 3.5mm audio cables included, so you can connect the charging case to a wired music system, such as the music system in a gym, or the in-flight entertainment system on a plane, and the case can then act as a Bluetooth transmitter that streams the audio to the earbuds. This is a great idea, as it combines the convenience of Bluetooth wireless audio with the ability to connect to wired audio systems when you need to.</p>\n\n<p>The noise-cancellation features also work well when you’re in noisy environments such as a gym or on a plane – although they’re not quite as effective as the latest AirPods Pro. However, the Pi7 S2 wins hands-down when it comes to sound quality, with a wonderfully clear and balanced sound that works well for a variety of different musical styles. The bouncing bass on <em>Bad Guy</em> by Billie Eilish combines a relaxed, infectious rhythm with a firm, taut bass beat, but it copes equally well with the delicate violins and soprano vocal on Max Richter’s <em>The Waves</em>. The only real disappointment – especially at this price – is that the battery life is a modest five hours on a single charge. Fortunately, the charging case lets you recharge the earbuds three more times, so it should still be able to cope with some long plane flights when it needs to.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.

The earbuds are also rated IP68 for resistance to water and dust, so they’ll be ideal for running in the park or working out at the gym, and the outer section of the earbuds is covered with a mesh fabric to reduce wind noise during voice calls. Logitech even includes an additional padded carrying case, with room to hold the charging case and cables, so you can keep the entire kit safe when you’re traveling.</p>\n\n<p>I often have trouble getting earbuds to stay in place, and I was initially a little worried about the rather chunky design of the Zone earbuds, but they did fit more firmly than I expected and Logitech provides three sets of ear-tips in different sizes to help get a comfortable fit. The size of the earbuds also means that each earbud is able to house a 12mm driver, as well as three microphones to help with active noise-cancellation (ANC).</p>\n\n<p>Even the Logi Tune app impresses with its extensive range of features – starting with the fact that it’s available for Mac and Windows as well as iOS and Android, so you can use it to set up the earbuds when you’re preparing for a video call at work. The noise-cancellation features include an ambient mode that lets you hear some of the background noise around you if required. You can pair the earbuds with two devices at the same time and then quickly switch between devices as required, and there’s a five-band equalizer for fine-tuning the sound quality. The Zone is also certified for use with Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet for video calls.</p>\n\n<p>But, of course, none of those features would matter if the Zone didn’t deliver on sound quality. You’ve actually got two options here, as the Zone can be used as a conventional set of Bluetooth earbuds with your mobile devices, but also includes a USB wireless transmitter that can be used with Macs and PCs to provide greater range and reliability than Bluetooth. The sound quality is very good in both modes, and the Zone does well to dig right down to the gravelly rumble of Leonard Cohen’s voice on You Want It Darker. There’s a taut, rhythmic sound to the song’s slinky bass guitar too, but it still keeps an eye on lighter details, such as the crisp tap on the snares.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life is good too, providing 10 hours when listening to music with noise-cancellation turned off, or six hours when using noise-cancellation. The battery life is a bit lower for talk-time on video and voice calls, but still lasts for six hours without noise cancellation or five hours with noise cancellation, which should be more than enough for most work-related calls. The charging case also lets you fully charge the earbuds two more times, and there’s a QuickCharge feature that gives you one hour of battery life after just five minutes of charging time. There’s a USB-C connector on the case for charging, but it also supports Qi wireless charging too. Alternatively, if you’re a die-hard lover of wired headphones, then Logitech is planning to release a wired version of the Zone soon as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.

The buds are IPX4 splash proof (the case isn’t). </p>\n\n<p>That touch area allows for taps or holds to do things such as pause or play audio, toggle noise canceling, or change volume. Unfortunately, you can’t swipe to change volume, instead tapping four times on left for down and four on right for up – which isn’t the most intuitive.</p>\n\n<p>The WF-1000XM5 produce incredibly full, clear, detailed and balanced sound. They deliver exceptionally good audio range. ‘Speed of Plight’ by Loyle Carner is well rounded with humming bass and the crackle of vinyl record at the beginning crystal clear. I’d never noticed the light reverb on the drums on Violent Femmes’s ‘<em>Blister in the Sun</em>’ before I listened on the WF-1000XM5.</p>\n\n<p>The XM5 play audio using the common SDC or AAC codecs, but you’ll get the best sound quality if you are using an Android phone – iPhones do not support Sony’s LDAC Hi-Res codec, which is why these don’t rank higher in our chart. The XM5 are so good that I still enjoyed the audio quality when using an iPhone with bog standard bitrate Spotify streams.</p>\n\n<p>Sony says the XM5 have 20% better noise cancellation chops than predecessors, the XM4. They are very good indeed. The XM5 have three mics on each bud, up from two, to better help capture ambient noise. These mics also grant improved call quality. Wind reduction is also decent. </p>\n\n<p>You can connect two devices (iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac) at once, but you still need to manually connect each device if you are cycling between more than two. Unfortunately they aren’t clever enough to switch from iPhone to iPad if you start using that, even if they are already a paired device.</p>\n\n<p>The XM5 have great battery life and fulfilled Sony’s promise of eight hours on a full charge. The case can provide another 24 hours of total listening time. Those times are with ANC on, turn it off and the battery will last even longer. A three-minute charge gives an hour playback. <em>Henry Burrell</em>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2005261/sony-wf-1000xm5-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSony WF-1000XM5 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7.

However, the AH-C830NCW is a much more affordable option, as it offers features and sound quality that rival the more expensive AirPods Pro for a very competitive price of just £139/$159.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the low price, the little earbuds feel quite solidly built, and they’re rated IPX4 for water resistance so they’ll be able to survive a spot of rain when you’re jogging around the local park. Denon also includes three sets of ear-tips in different sizes to help you get a good fit.</p>\n\n<p>The earbuds support the same AAC codec as the AirPods for Bluetooth audio, and the sound quality is very good for such an affordable set of earbuds. There’s a clear, delicate tone to the electronic chimes and soprano vocals on Max Richter’s The Waves, and the earbuds balance the complex arrangement very well as the strings and horns of Richter’s orchestra weave around each other and build to a tremendous crescendo. They can handle some more upbeat workout music too, with a nice gritty guitar sound and ticking percussion on Sing Along by Sturgill Simpson.</p>\n\n<p>The noise-cancellation features work well too. The earbuds do a good job of blocking both the deep rumble of an aircraft engine and the more varied background sounds found in a typical airport setting. The low price does involve some compromises, though. There’s no app for the AH-C830NCW so we found ourselves having to pour over the manual in order to memorize the various finger-tapping combinations needed to adjust noise cancellation and other settings. The charging case doesn’t support wireless charging either, so it can only be charged via its USB-C port. Battery life is fairly modest at around five hours when using noise-cancellation, but you can charge the earbuds three more times using the charging case for a total of 20 hours with noise-cancellation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.

This is where spending more on earbuds pays off as they have drivers that can properly separate different tracks. </p>\n\n<p>Active noise cancellation worked so well that we won’t hear any outside noise – so luckily there’s Aware Mode: tap and hold either earbud to allow ambient sound in. That works in conjunction with ActiveSense, which detects louder sounds and reduces them, so you won’t be deafened by an ambulance passing in the street. </p>\n\n<p>You control play/pause with a tap. To skip forward and backtrack with two or three. Volume is controlled by sliding up and down.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are a few things that let the QuietComfort Earbuds 2 down. They aren’t all that comfortable if you have small ears. There are three sizes of wingtip and ear tip in the box so you can get the best possible fit though, so it might be ok for you. </p>\n\n<p>Another big disadvantage is that you can only be connected to one Bluetooth source at a time, unlike AirPods.</p>\n\n<p>They do not support high-resolution audio codecs such as LDAC or FLAC, and there is no spatial audio support either. But they do support SBC and AAC to cover all modern consumer Bluetooth devices. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1371376/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBose QuietComfort Earbuds II review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.

You can immediately spot the differences between the two models, with the newer AirPods having a shorter stalk, and a more compact earpiece that is slightly angled in order to fit more securely inside your ear. However, they still don’t use silicon eartips that would provide a firmer fit – that’s only an option with the even more expensive AirPods Pro – and I personally found it quite easy to dislodge the AirPods from my ears.</p>\n\n<p>The sound quality is very good, though, thanks to a new custom-designed driver inside the earpieces. This produces a more balanced sound than its predecessor, producing a sinister bass rumble on Billie Eilish’s You Should See Me In A Crown. This model also provides spatial audio and head-tracking for watching films and video too, along with a wireless charging case. Battery life is better too, lasting for six hours on a single charge, or 30 hours in total with the charging case. It’s a shame, though, that the AirPods (3rd Generation) don’t also provide active noise-cancellation (ANC), so if you need that feature then you’ll have to pay even more for the AirPods Pro, at <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668628-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLWK3AM/A/airpods-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$249</a>/<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668628-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLWK3ZM/A/airpods-pro\" target=\"_blank\">£239</a>, or opt for one of the cheaper rival earbuds that we also review here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668166/airpods-3-2021-review-great-sounding-long-lasting.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple AirPods (3rd gen, 2021, MagSafe) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.

You can use the accompanying Audio Connect app to tweak the earbuds’ EQ settings. buds also support Hi-Res audio using the LDAC codec, but this doesn’t work on iPhones at all, unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>The active noise cancellation (ANC) is good, but it couldn’t stand up to the rigors of the London Underground or other especially noisy environments. There’s also an ambient mode so you can listen to your surroundings. The AZ60M2 are capable of connecting to up to three devices simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also an IPX4 rating, meaning the buds (though not case) can withstand rain, sweat, and other splashes of liquid. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1949677/technics-eah-az60m2-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnics EAH-AZ60M2 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11.

They don’t stop there either, as the oddly-named little earbuds pack in plenty of other useful features too.</p>\n\n<p>The compact earbuds are provided with four sizes of eartips, so most people should be able to get a good fit, and they’re rated IPX5 for water resistance so they’re well suited to outdoor use during the soggy summer festival months. You can turn ANC on or off simply by pressing and holding the button on either earbud, and there’s a ‘transparency’ mode that allows you to listen out for people or other sounds around you. Admittedly, it’s not the most powerful noise-cancellation we’ve heard – it tends to dim background noise down, rather than blocking it altogether – but it’s still a handy option for when you’re out and about during the day.</p>\n\n<p>Sound quality is good for such a low-cost set of earbuds, with support for Apple’s AAC Bluetooth codec. It’s not the loudest set of earbuds we’ve come across, but the bass has a nice thump to it – some people might find it a bit exaggerated, but the app provides presets for both boosting and reducing the bass, so the PistonBuds Pro will be particularly good for dance music, and a cheaper alternative to both the AirPods and Beats ranges.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life is good too, at five hours with ANC turned on, or seven hours without ANC, and the charging case lets you charge the earbuds three more times when you’re traveling.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12.

Apart from black, they are available in Yuzu Yellow, Smoke Grey and Flame Blue.</p>\n\n<p>While wireless earbuds are the booming part of the market, neckbuds shouldn’t be underestimated. The design means that you won’t lose an earbud if it falls out and you can simply leave them having around your neck when they’re not in use.</p>\n\n<p>Like many others, the two earbuds contain magnets so they snap together when you’re not using them. The band is made from a sturdy material called Nitinol and a control module on the left-hand side provides volume and playback controls, as well as a mic for voice calls.</p>\n\n<p>At just 18.6g total, the Beats Flex are good if you do plan to go running or similar. Note that they don’t offer any official IP waterproof rating, although the rubber-like build should keep out splashes.</p>\n\n<p>As you would expect, pairing them with Apple products is a breeze and you can also use the Audio Sharing option to stream your music to a friend who has a compatible set of AirPods or Beats headphones.</p>\n\n<p>With 12 hours of battery life, they last longer than wireless earbuds and a ‘fast fuel’ feature means you can get 1.5 hours of playback from a 10-minute charge over USB-C.</p>\n\n<p>The low price doesn’t mean bad sound either and “The deep bass on Bad Guy by Billie Eilish has a firm, rhythmic pulse that drives the song forward. There’s a nice crisp sound to the finger-snaps that punctuate the song, and the Flex really captures the shrug-of-the-shoulders tone as Billy pronounces “duh…” halfway through. There’s plenty of detail, too, as the Flex picks up all the multi-layered harmonies on Queen’s Somebody To Love.</p>\n\n<p>The Flex can even handle more delicate classical sounds, capturing the sad, mournful tone of the cello and violin as they slowly weave through the air on Max Richter’s On The Nature Of Daylight.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668059/beats-flex-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeats Flex review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13.

The CX Plus has the same rather bulky design as its predecessor – which was on sale for £119 – but that’s a minor complaint, and the attractive sound quality and effective noise-cancellation features represent great value for money.</p>\n\n<p>The size of the earbuds also means that they have room for a decent size battery, lasting for around eight hours on a single charge. Using noise-cancellation cuts that down by about an hour, but the charging case lets you recharge the earbuds two more times, so you’ll get 21-24 hours of music depending on usage, making the CX Plus a good option for long journeys. </p>\n\n<p>Regular travelers will also appreciate the noise-cancellation features, which do a good job of blocking out background noise. The Sennheiser app provides some simple EQ controls and, as well as the transparency feature provided by many headphones, the app also allows you to create and save sound zones for specific locations, such as the gym or on a train, that have their own customized settings.</p>\n\n<p>The CX Plus supports both Apple’s AAC for Bluetooth, and AptX for Android devices, and sound quality is really good for earbuds in this price range. Blondie’s Rapture kicks off with a crisp, sharp cymbal crash and the CX Plus delivers the song’s catchy bass line with a hip-swaying rhythm. It’s a very precise sound too, catching all the little background details such as the ticking percussion and jangling rhythm guitar. The charging case doesn’t support wireless charging, but that’s an acceptable compromise at this price, and the CX Plus stands out as a really good set of earbuds at a very competitive price.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14.

Available in black or white, the PI5 also includes active noise-cancellation and a wireless charging case for a price of $249/£199 that makes it an excellent alternative to the AirPods Pro.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, the chunky design of the earbuds may not suit everyone, but B&amp;W includes three sizes of eartips to help you get a good fit, and the earbuds have an IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, so they’re sturdy enough to cope with life outdoors.</p>\n\n<p>Sound quality is excellent, and the PI5 supports both Apple’s AAC and AptX for Bluetooth audio, so they’ll be a good option for non-Apple devices too. There’s a terrific, relaxed feel to the opening guitar riff on The Rolling Stones’ Start Me Up, and the PI5 perfectly catches Charlie Watts’ precise, unfussy drumming. But switch to Prime Evil by The Orb, and the PI5 digs really deep to deliver the dance track’s sinister bass effects with an impressively slinky rhythm. The noise-cancellation features work well too, doing a good job of blocking out background noise without making any noticeable different to the sound quality. And, like most headphones these days, they also provide an ‘ambient’ mode that allows you to listen out for background sounds when you need to.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life could, perhaps, be a little better, lasting for 4.5 hours when using noise-cancellation. However, that’s similar to the more expensive AirPods Pro, and the wireless charging case allows you to charge the earbuds three more times when you’re away from home.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15.

Although earbuds don’t produce outstanding sound, they’re compact and relatively inexpensive. Apple’s stock ‘buds are actually decent as earbuds go; you’re not going to get a huge upgrade in sound quality by simply replacing them with a different model. Still, there are a few alternatives out there that provide modest improvements if you’re looking for a new set. Recommendations:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In-Ear-Canal Headphones</strong>: These headphones, also known as canalphones, use silicone or foam eartips that fit snugly—and fairly deep—in your ear canals. Like earplugs, they block most external noise, so they’re great for travel and noisy environments. They’re also capable of producing stunning audio quality. On the other hand, some people find canalphones to be uncomfortable, and the best ones come with an equally stunning price tag. If you decide to spend the big bucks on a set of high-end canalphones, we enthusiastically recommend going all-in and getting custom eartips—tips custom-made for your particular ears. The process requires an audiologist visit to get impressions taken of your ears, but the benefits include substantially better comfort. (On some models, you may gain better noise isolation and better sound quality, as well.) A step above custom eartips are custom in-ear monitors, which place the actual headphone circuitry in larger, custom-made earpieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Canalbuds</strong>: Canalbuds, which occupy a middle ground between earbuds and in-ear-canal models, have become quite popular. Compared to canalphones, canalbuds generally use smaller eartips that sit just inside the ends of your ear canals instead of deep inside them. Good canalbuds easily best earbuds in terms of audio performance and noise isolation, but fall short of good canalphones in those areas. On the other hand, canalbuds tend to be more comfortable than true canalphones because they don’t sit so deep and don’t fit so tightly; they’re also usually less expensive. (See our in-ear-canal-headphone primer, linked above, for more information on canalbuds.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Battery life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is crucial as many in-ear headphones have tiny batteries that help to keep the weight down but may only last for a few hours. That might be fine if you just want to listen to some music while you’re working out, but won’t be much use on a long journey by train or plane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some in-ear headphones, such as Apple’s AirPods, also include a charging case that can top up the battery, so that’s something you should check on before buying any in-ear headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Noise canceling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some headphones are specifically designed for people who travel a lot or use headphones in noisy conditions and provide active noise-canceling (ANC) option that helps to block out background noise on trains and planes – although this can add quite a lot to the overall price of the headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note this isn’t to be confused with passive noise isolation (or often referred to as canceling), which is just the way physically having headphones in/on blocks sound – like putting earplugs or ear defenders on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sound quality</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d always recommend trying out any new headphones in a store or showroom whenever possible, but that’s not always practical with so many new headphones competing for your attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All the headphones here will work excellently with the latest iPhone models. It’s typical for them to support Apple’s preferred AAC codec, although some will have others too like aptX which is handy if you want to also use them with other devices like Android phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting that all Bluetooth headphones mentioned in this article are compatible with the Apple Watch – perfect when going for a run.</p>\n\nApple Inc, Computer Accessories, Home Audio, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"46179922af1aa00f933f5ae95e4d24a7e02347f01564251bc736160962bc656b","category":"Apple"}
