According to a new report, that time is rapidly approaching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-taps-TSMC-to-build-custom-iPhone-5G-modem-in-2023&amp;xcust=1-1-554612-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Japan-based Nikkei Asia reports</a> that Apple has tapped TSMC to build the new modem, which will use 4-nanometer chip production technology. The current modem in the iPhone 13, Qualcomm’s X60, is built on a 5nm process. The report says production for new modem will begin in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the report, Apple is building the modem from the ground up with its own radio frequency and millimeter wave components as well as a custom power management chip, however, the first iteration might not be integrated into the processor. DigiTimes reported last week that Apple’s first 5G modem would be <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-5g-modem-separate-from-a-series-chip/&amp;xcust=1-1-554612-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">separate from the A17</a> and Nikkei Asia seemingly confirms that by saying the 2023 modem would “pave the way” to integrate the modem with the processor, suggesting that the first model will be separate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 5G modem built into the iPhone processor would be the first time Apple delivers an integrated module. The X60 modem is integrated in Qualcomm’s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393754/inside-the-snapdragon-888-the-features-youll-find-in-2021s-premium-phones.html\">Snapdragon 888 processor</a> on high-end Android phones, but Apple uses it separately from the A15 processor in the iPhone 13. An integrated modem would provide power efficiency and space-saving benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple signed a “multiyear chipset supply agreement” when it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232670/apple-qualcomm-settle-legal-case.html\">settled its lawsuit with Qualcomm</a> in 2019, which is primarily the 5G modem in the iPhone and iPad. However, Qualcomm announced at its earnings that it will only supply <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://nypost.com/2021/11/16/apple-will-self-supply-up-to-80-percent-of-iphone-modem-chips-qualcomm-predicts/&amp;xcust=1-1-554612-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">20 percent of iPhone modems</a> by 2023, suggesting that Apple is indeed on track to deliver its own model by then.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3e1cdf74e0b820fe1da82b6e2c8820eab03d29dd0fc2434dc71da228bb7f73e8","category":"Apple"}
