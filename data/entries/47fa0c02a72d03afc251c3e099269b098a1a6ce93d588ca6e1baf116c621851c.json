It starts in Penzance, running almost from one end of Great Britain to the other to finish in Aberdeen.</p>\n<p>Despite a somewhat humble ranking, this UCI Europe Tour race often attracts big names, and this year is no exception. Superstars <a href=\"http://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish</a>, Julian Alaphilippe and Wout van Aert will be joining riders other well-known names such as Richie Porte, Dan Martin, and Marc Soler in an eight-day dash from south to north.</p>\n<p>With Alaphilippe and Mathieu van der Poel the two most recent winners, a late-season success in Britain is widely considered no bad thing to add to your palmarès.</p>\n<p>Although Van der Poel had been slated to ride, a slow recovery following a crash at the Olympics means we won’t get to see his and Van Aert’s unending drama play out on British roads. However, a packed field and equally exciting route including a lot of climbing eked from a comparatively flat island mean it should be well worth tuning in for.</p>\n<h3>How to watch the Tour of Britain 2021</h3>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/07/2019_tour_of_britain_champion_mathieu_van_der_poel.jpg?itok=wWeQGB-e\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>If you’re in the UK, you could of course watch from the roadside.
