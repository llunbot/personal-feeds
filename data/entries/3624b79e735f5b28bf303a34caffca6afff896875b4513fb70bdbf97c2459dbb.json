After all, Pogačar attacked on the beer’s namesake on the Oude Kwaremont to blow up the men’s edition and pave the way for the stunning solo victory.</p>\n<p>The beer was launched in 2010 by <a href=\"https://www.brouwerijdebrabandere.be/en/brands\">De Brabandere Brewery</a>, near to Harelbeke. The company dates back to 1894, and its other brands include Batik, Petrus, and Wieze.</p>\n<p>It’s one of the top sponsors of the E3 Saxo Classic, and promotes its Kwaremont brand across Belgium with the slogan, “Cycling beer for cycling lovers.”</p>\n<p>The Kwaremont is linked to the eponymous climb, and its label is market by a triangle warning sign marking its 6.6 percent alcohol content (some say light by Belgian standards) that is equal to the gradient on the Oude Kwaremont climb.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1249272226.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption><span>Belgium’s Wout van Aert celebrates victory at E3 Saxo Classic last month with a Kwaremont beer.
