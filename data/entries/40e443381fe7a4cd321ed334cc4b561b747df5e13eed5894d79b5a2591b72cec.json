The streaming giant also released <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441813546560630784?s=20\">several character posters</a> for the series during its <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-tudum-global-fan-event-stranger-things-the-harder-they-fall-1235048463/\">Tudum global fan event</a>. And in addition to <em>The Sandman</em>, we got a tantalizing new teaser for <em>Stranger Things</em> S4, the opening credits for <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, and new trailers for <em>Army of Thieves</em> and <em>The Witcher</em> S2, among other goodies.</p>\n<h2><i>The Sandman </i>teaser</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/neil-gaimans-sandman-graphic-novels-to-become-a-netflix-tv-series/\">I've written previously</a>, the titular \"sandman\" is Dream, aka Morpheus, among other names. He is one of seven entities known as the Endless, and he is seeking to set right his past mistakes. The other Endless are Destiny, Destruction, Despair, Desire, Delirium, and Death (portrayed as a perky punk/goth young woman). They became almost as popular as Dream himself (especially Death) and were featured in several spinoff comics. The series opens when Morpheus, the King of Dreams, escapes from a 70-year imprisonment by an occultist—who actually wanted to capture Dream's sibling Death but trapped the Sandman by mistake.</p>\n<p>Gaiman has been heavily involved with this Netflix adaptation, which bodes well for the project. Tom Sturridge snagged the coveted role of Morpheus, Lord of the Dreaming, no doubt due in part to his well-sculpted cheekbones. As for Dream's Endless Siblings, Kirby Howell-Baptiste plays Death, Donna Preston plays Despair, and Mason Alexander Park plays Desire. <em>Game of Thrones</em> alums Gwendoline Christie and Charles Dance play a gender-swapped Lucifer and the charlatan magician Roderick Burgess, respectively. (Burgess is styled after real-life occultist Aleister Crowley and is Crowley's arch-rival within the world of DC Comics.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798435#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798435&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"40e443381fe7a4cd321ed334cc4b561b747df5e13eed5894d79b5a2591b72cec","category":"Tech"}
