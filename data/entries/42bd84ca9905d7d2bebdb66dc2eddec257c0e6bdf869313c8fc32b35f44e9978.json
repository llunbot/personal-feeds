Get the kettle on and settle in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our chat begins at 7m37s.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/84-greg-lemond-on-getting-shot-getting-back-up-and-winning-t\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 84 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Science in Sports’ energy supplements, including SiS’s GO Isotonic energy gels – the world’s first energy gels to mimic the gut’s fluid composition to be absorbed more rapidly into the bloodstream.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Each energy gel provides 22g of carbohydrates to boost energy on the bike and stave off fatigue, so like all SiS products, Go Isotonic gels are scientifically formulated to help riders maintain their pace for longer. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When Grand Tours are raced on the edge and won by seconds, it’s crucial to get the right fuel at the right time.

When stored carbs are depleted, your body starts to convert fat into ketones. Studies show that ketones are 28% more efficient than glucose, making them a super-efficient fuel source for the brain and the body.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These benefits led H.V.M.N to create Ketone-IQ: a drinkable ketone designed to support energy, focus and endurance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Developed alongside the U.S. military, Ketone-IQ is one of the most powerful ketone supplements on the market. It’s designed to elevate your ketone levels for up to 4 hours – much longer than other products. Plus, it’s vegan, caffeine free, and compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s guidelines. That’s a major win for athletes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ketone-IQ Shots are the best way to get your ketones on the go. They’re portable, convenient, and fit perfectly in your pocket during a ride or a race.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can save 30% on Ketone-IQ using the promo code CYCLIST at  </em><a href=\"https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST\" target=\"_blank\"><em>https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about achieving your ultimate metabolic potential, subscribe to H.V.M.N’s podcast ‘Health Via Modern Nutrition with Dr. Latt Mansor’ on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube.
