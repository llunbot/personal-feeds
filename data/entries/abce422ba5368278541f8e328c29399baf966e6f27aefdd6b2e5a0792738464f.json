Sonny Dickson today <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1879791001826673131\">shared some images</a> of an ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 dummy model, giving us insight into what it could look like.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"746\" />\r<br />\nFor those unfamiliar with dummy models, they are non-functional mockups of new devices that case makers create based on information that leaks out of Apple's partner factories. There is big money in being the first to have a case for a new device, and over the years, leaked dummy models have turned out to be accurate in most cases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors have suggested the next ‌iPhone SE‌ will look like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, and that seems to be accurate based on the images. There's an iPhone-14 style chassis with an aluminum band, a glass back, and a single-lens rear camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"960\" />\r<br />\nThere have been suggestions that the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 could get an Action Button or the Camera Control button that's available on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, but neither of those features is depicted on these dummy models. That doesn't mean it won't happen, but it does make it less likely because case makers would need to accommodate these features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe upcoming ‌iPhone SE‌ has been largely referred to as the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4, but there was a recent rumor indicating that Apple might call it the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 16E. Along with the visible features from the dummy model, the ‌iPhone SE‌ is expected to include a faster A17 Pro chip that supports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, an Apple-designed modem chip, and 8GB RAM. While it will only have that single camera, the camera is the same 48-megapixel Wide camera in the current ‌iPhone 16‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are expecting to see Apple debut the next ‌iPhone SE‌ sometime in March or April, and it will continue to be the company's lowest-cost device. It could go up in price a bit, but Apple is said to be aiming to keep it below $500.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/iphone-se-4-dummy/\">iPhone SE 4 Dummies Feature iPhone 14-Style Design With No Action Button or Camera Control</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-dummies-feature-iphone-14-style-design-with-no-action-button-or-camera-control.2447549/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"abce422ba5368278541f8e328c29399baf966e6f27aefdd6b2e5a0792738464f","category":"Apple"}
