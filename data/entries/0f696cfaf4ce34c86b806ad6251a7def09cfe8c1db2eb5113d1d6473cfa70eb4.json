The headset will start at $499.99 with 128GB of storage, and Meta will also be lowering the starting price of the Quest 2 back to $299.99 on June 4. The company plans to share more details about the Quest 3 during its Meta Connect event on September 27.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's headset is rumored to cost around $3,000, so the Quest 3 could be significantly cheaper. Meta also said the Quest 3 has an all-in-one design, whereas Apple's headset will reportedly include an external battery pack that attaches with a wire.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIn his newsletter last weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman provided <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-28/meta-quest-3-real-life-hands-on-how-it-compares-to-apple-mixed-reality-headset-li7h3suy\">hands-on impressions of the Quest 3</a> before it was announced.
