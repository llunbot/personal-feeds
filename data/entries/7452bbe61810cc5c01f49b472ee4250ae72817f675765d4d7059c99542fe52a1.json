His countryman <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-28-johan-museeuw-the-lion-of-flanders\" target=\"_blank\">Johan Museeuw</a> has a Hell of the North story like no one else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw won the Queen of the Classics three times and podiumed on a further three occasions, riding it 15 times in total. He finished all but one – in 1998, when he suffered a horrific crash in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-arenberg-forest\" target=\"_blank\">Arenberg</a>. That a subsequent infection from the mud seeping into his shattered kneecap led to gangrene and very nearly amputation made his second win, in 2000, all the more special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As ever, this weekend’s editions are for the hardcore riders. The men’s route covers 256.6km, with 29 cobbled sectors for 54.5km of bone-juddering, muddy mayhem. It starts in Compiègne, 80km north-east of Paris, and ends with two laps of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/where-paris-roubaix-2022-will-be-decided-part-4-roubaix-velodrome\" target=\"_blank\">Roubaix Velodrome</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7151_Retouch_001-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>It’s still cold in April.</figcaption><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Roubaix is a lot of suffering for the body,’ says Museeuw. ‘Fifty-five kilometres of cobblestones is not normal, it’s not okay for the body. The winner doesn’t feel anything, and the losers are completely dead. Body empty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Every rider, after Roubaix, you have to do a pee, it’s always a little bit [he whistles a low, slow whistle] hurting. Not hurting, hurting. But you feel that it is an unusual day. That’s about the impact [he pounds his hands together again and again], all day. Lucky that the saddles now are better than in our generation. Bikes are better. Lucky for the prostate, eh? Our generation was really [Museeuw squints] ‘ooohhh’ first time that you do a wee.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Point made. Now for the strategy for success among the suffering and sadism.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Left, right or down the middle?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-5905_Retouch_001-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Collecting a cobblestone of your own begins in the mind, says Museeuw: ‘You can’t lose concentration. I was a rider who, as soon as the race started, didn’t talk. Even before the first cobbled section, the peloton are nervous. You can’t look at other riders. You have to take care of yourself. A lot of things can happen around you. But if there is something in your mind, it’s already too much.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, riders have almost 100km to cover before the first section of cobbles in Troisvilles. But no matter the point in the race, Museeuw says the most dangerous places are the entrance to the cobbles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s always a sprint, before every section,’ he explains. ‘People think it’s difficult on the cobblestones. Yes it’s difficult, but if you are always top 10, it’s easy. The most difficult thing in Roubaix is position. With experience, after a couple of years you know the roads, you know where you have to be without spending too much energy.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The accepted wisdom for the cobbled <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a> is that riding the gutter gives riders a smoother path. Not so for the Lion of Flanders, ‘I was always riding in the middle, so you save energy. Peter Sagan did it, too. That’s something a champion has. It’s more difficult on the left and right; everyone wants to go there, so there is more space in the middle. That’s experience. It’s easy to say, but it’s not so easy to do.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Right to ask for rain?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-6379_Retouch_001-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I didn’t like when it was raining on the day at the start,’ says Museeuw. ‘If you have to do the whole day in the rain, it was really hard, and dangerous, and difficult. I preferred it when it was raining the day or the night before. Then you’d know the first sections would be very muddy and slippery.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says a wet Roubaix brings with it a noticeable change in the attitude of the peloton. ‘Riders are more afraid when it’s wet. If there is a crash in the middle of the peloton, it can be over… [Now] I love to see it. I know it’s not good to say, because I know that if it’s wet, the riders will crash. It’s mythic. It’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was a cyclocross man and a rider who really liked when it was slippery. More elimination. Yes, I crashed when it was slippery [in 1998]. Was it my fault? Yes and no. We were going too fast at the entry. That’s the adrenaline of the race and the riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You don’t think. You go full gas. If you think, it’s over. As a rider, you don’t have to think. You go at 60kmh, because there’s a little bit of a descent to the entry of the Arenberg. From the beginning I was in third position, but from the first few metres I had the feeling that I don’t have control of the bike. I crash. A rider always wants to stand up immediately. I did that also… I touched my knee and I saw it was open. I saw the bone. Now it was impossible to ride any further.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is the right time to attack?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-3620_Retouch_001-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of Museeuw’s Roubaix wins came from a team or solo attack. He says picking a precise point before the race is not typically how it works: you follow the peloton, you follow the break, you follow how you feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was always in here,’ Museeuw touches his stomach. ‘My last Roubaix I won [in 2002], it was unexpected. I hear on the radio: ‘Look out, there’s oil on the road,’ that had leaked from a car. I was in first position, so I came out [of that corner] and I was looking behind me, and I saw nobody. I didn’t plan to go but I was alone.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was with around 40km left, shortly before the cobbled sector to Moulin de Vertain – part of Sector 8 in this year’s race. That same corner, which was made extra slick by the rain, took down a handful of riders behind him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘So then you can do two things. You can say, “It’s too early.” Because I was riding with the Campagnolo, I have to do the shifter like this [Museeuw mimics reaching to his downtube]. And then you go, and if you win, you say: “Ah, great!” If they don’t say to me there is oil on the road, maybe I go back 10 positions. But you have to make the decision in one second – very fast – that’s here [in your gut], eh?’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/CAuldPhoto-LeCol-LoF-7427_Retouch_001-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>His first Roubaix victory, in 1996, was different. Propelled by a tailwind, Museeuw attacked with three teammates to set-up an unprecedented triple on the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That podium clean sweep is the inspiration for the Mapei-style jersey in <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/lion-of-flanders-collection\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col’s new Lion of Flanders collection</a>. <em>Cyclist </em>has been granted an audience with Museeuw at the photoshoot, part of which sees him returning to the Roubaix Velodrome. The other jersey is a tribute to Museeuw’s status as a national treasure and comes in black, with the Belgian flag across the pockets and subtle streaks of mud and rain on the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Roubaix that I won with teammates, that was planned, to go 90km from the finish,’ says Museeuw. ‘A very long section, you’re full gas and we came out with four. First was Franco Ballerini, who punctured. We didn’t wait. We go to the velodrome with three. Was that beautiful? No. Would I do it again in this way? No, but sometimes you don’t think. Sometimes you’re in the flow of the team, and let it go.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\">Opinion: Tadej Pogačar is the Greatest Of All Time</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-arenberg-forest\">Where Paris-Roubaix 2023 will be decided, part 1: The Arenberg Forest</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-all-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix 2023: Routes, start lists and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Johan Museeuw’s 2023 men’s Paris-Roubaix prediction</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/DSC_0024-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld for Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw will be watching this year’s race in hospitality at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/where-paris-roubaix-2022-will-be-decided-part-3-carrefour-de-l-arbre\" target=\"_blank\">Carrefour de l’Arbre</a> sector. Who does he see as still being in contention there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Again <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dylan-van-baarle-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Dylan van Baarle</a>. He knows what it is to win. Of course, Van Aert. Probably any of the Jumbo-Visma team.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christophe Laporte would seem to be their other man on form, after his Gent-Wevelgem and Dwars door Vlaanderen victories. Who else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Why not Tiesj Benoot? Alpecin-Deceuninck, and of course Mathieu van der Poel. The team of Patrick Lefevere [Soudal-QuickStep], maybe, but they don’t really have a rider for Roubaix. Like a Franco Ballerini, like an Andrea Tafi, like me, like Tom Boonen. They are more building a team around Remco Evenepoel. You see it already now in the Classics. They are not like before, now they have to wait, because they are not strong enough anymore.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can Ineos do it again, without Van Baarle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Ineos are coming from a time when they were just out for two riders in a Grand Tour. Now they want to win the Classics and the one-day races. Tactically, they are still a bit different than other teams. That’s not a criticism, but they don’t really have the feeling to do it. People from here, they train here, they know the roads, every corner, every hill – they know it. Other riders come here and know the roads a little, but not the same. This is our culture. Our riders know these races very well.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, who will win Roubaix this year, and what will his story be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Van Aert. He will arrive alone, if Jumbo-Visma make the race very hard. I think he will come in his best condition.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://lecol.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col’s Lion of Flanders Collection is available now at lecol.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-johan-museeuw\">Johan Museeuw’s Paris-Roubaix preview: How to win the Hell of the North and 2023 predictions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7452bbe61810cc5c01f49b472ee4250ae72817f675765d4d7059c99542fe52a1","category":"Cycling"}
