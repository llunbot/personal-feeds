While Arlo still hasn't implemented HomeKit Secure Video support (something many users have been clamoring for), standard HomeKit integration is a meaningful step toward a more unified smart home experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe rollout appears to be specifically for second-generation Essential devices, so owners of first-gen or other Arlo camera lines might need to wait a bit longer (or invest in newer hardware) to enjoy the same Apple Home integration.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arlo/\">Arlo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/25/arlo-apple-home-support-2nd-gen-essential-cameras/\">Arlo Rolls Out Apple Home Support for 2nd-Gen Essential Camera Lineup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/arlo-rolls-out-apple-home-support-for-2nd-gen-essential-camera-lineup.2455933/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3575aad0d59449d086312d0f2b464fd7955db37a92a2d52bb035b4931a776d2f","category":"Apple"}
