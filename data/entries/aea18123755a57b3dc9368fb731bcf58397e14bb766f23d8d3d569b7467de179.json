On 25\nJuly, President Emmanuel Macron designated me as France’s official\ncandidate for a second mandate in the College of Commissioners — as he had already publicly announced on the margins of the\nEuropean Council on 28 June. A few days ago, in the very final\nstretch of negotiations on the composition of the future College,\nyou asked France to withdraw my name — for personal reasons that\nin no instance you have discussed directly with me — and offered,\nas a political trade-off, an allegedly more influential portfolio\nfor France in the future College. You will now be proposed a\ndifferent candidate.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past five years, I have relentlessly striven to uphold\nand advance the common European good, above national and party\ninterests. It has been an honour.</p>\n\n<p>However, in light of these latest developments — further testimony\nto questionable governance — I have to conclude that I can no\nlonger exercise my duties in the College.</p>\n\n<p>I am therefore resigning from my position as European\nCommissioner, effective immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation from bureaucratese to English: “Faced with being fired <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/18/breton-jackass\">for being a jackass</a> or resigning, I resign.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/16/breton-resigns\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"aea18123755a57b3dc9368fb731bcf58397e14bb766f23d8d3d569b7467de179","category":"Tech"}
