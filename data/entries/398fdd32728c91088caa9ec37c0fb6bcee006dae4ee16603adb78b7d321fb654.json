In <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/extreme-overclocker-recommends-heating-arrow-lake-cpus-to-165-degrees-celsius-before-delidding-the-cpu-has-to-be-hot-enough-so-the-indium-melts-but-not-too-hot-to-not-damage-the-smds\">one overclocking forum thread</a>, a seasoned expert noted that Intel's Core Ultra 200S spreader (IHS) needs to be heated above 165° C for the indium (transfer material) to loosen. But then the glue holding the IHS is also loose at this temperature, and there is only 1.5–2 millimeters of space between IHS and surface-mounted components, so it's easy for that metal IHS to slide off and take out a vital component with it. It's quite the Saturday afternoon hobby.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/now-the-overclock-curious-can-buy-a-delidded-amd-9800x3d-with-a-warranty/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/now-the-overclock-curious-can-buy-a-delidded-amd-9800x3d-with-a-warranty/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"398fdd32728c91088caa9ec37c0fb6bcee006dae4ee16603adb78b7d321fb654","category":"Tech"}
