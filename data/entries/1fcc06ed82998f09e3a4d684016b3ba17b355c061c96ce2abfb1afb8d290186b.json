Yes, real Photoshop. After releasing a mobile version of Photoshop on iPhone earlier this year, the promised Android release has finally arrived. You can download it right now in beta, and it's free to use for the duration of the beta period.</p>\n<p>The mobile app includes a reasonably broad selection of tools from the desktop version of Adobe's iconic image editor, including masks, clone stamp, layers, transformations, cropping, and an array of generative AI tools. The app looks rather barebones when you first start using it, but the toolbar surfaces features as you select areas and manipulate layers.</p>\n<p>Depending on how you count, this is Adobe's <em>third</em> attempt to do Photoshop on phones. So far, it appears to be the most comprehensive, though. It's much more capable than <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.psmobile\">Photoshop Express</a> or the ancient <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/photoshop-touch-puts-graphic-design-in-the-palm-of-your-hands/\">Photoshop Touch app</a>, which Adobe unpublished almost a decade ago.
