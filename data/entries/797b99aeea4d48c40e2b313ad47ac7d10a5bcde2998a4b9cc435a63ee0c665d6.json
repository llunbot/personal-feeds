{"title":"Tony Bennett, the Epitome of New York Cool","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/nyregion/tony-bennett-new-york.html","date":1690136473000,"content":"\n<p>James Barron, writing for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tony Bennett may have become famous for “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” but his own heart was unquestionably a New Yorker’s. He had that New York cool, decade after decade — the kid from Astoria, Queens, who made a go of it in Manhattan.</p>\n\n<p>“He was Mr. New York,” said the philanthropist Iris Cantor, a friend of Mr. Bennett’s. “That’s who he was.”</p>\n\n<p>The city shaped him, from a hard-knock childhood with only-in-New-York breaks: As a 9-year-old, he sang at the opening of the Triborough Bridge (now the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge). And his fortunes seemed to run in tandem with the city’s: In the 1950s and ‘60s he, and it, were flying high. In the ‘70s, his popularity sank, torpedoed by the rock revolution, and the city’s finances imploded.</p>\n\n<p>Both managed comebacks, Bennett with breathtaking moments when he was 60. And 70. And 80. And 90.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Man, that photo of Bennett painting by himself in Central Park — amazing. Rest in peace.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/23/bennett-new-york-cool\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"797b99aeea4d48c40e2b313ad47ac7d10a5bcde2998a4b9cc435a63ee0c665d6","category":"Tech"}
