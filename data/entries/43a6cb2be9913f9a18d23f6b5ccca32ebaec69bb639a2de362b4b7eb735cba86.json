You can enter your destination and receive turn-by-turn directions, with the added benefit of being able to view the weather along your driving route. The weather features include live radar, severe weather warnings, wind speeds, visibility levels, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCARROT Weather's turn-by-turn directions are as snarky as its weather forecasts, so prepare for remarks such as \"turn left on Rodeo Drive, meatbag,\" or \"you went the wrong way, idiot, now I have to recalculate your entire route.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith auto-starting Live Activities, CARROT Weather's next-hour precipitation chart can now start automatically when precipitation is in the area. Users will receive a notification around 15 minutes before rain or snow begins, and then a Live Activities widget will continuously appear on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island until the precipitation stops. Previously, you had to open the app to start a Live Activity each time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/CARROT-Weather-Live-Activities.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nBoth new features require a CARROT Weather Premium subscription.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCARROT Weather version 6.2 is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574\">available in the App Store</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/carrot-weather-carplay/\">CARROT Weather Introduces CarPlay App and Automatic Live Activities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/carrot-weather-introduces-carplay-app-and-automatic-live-activities.2447527/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43a6cb2be9913f9a18d23f6b5ccca32ebaec69bb639a2de362b4b7eb735cba86","category":"Apple"}
