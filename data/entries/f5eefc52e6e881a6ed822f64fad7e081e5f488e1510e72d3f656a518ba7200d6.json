And in recent times some of his builds have included stealthy integrated electronic shifting, or hacked suspension lockouts and dropper posts that run off a single controller. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the Jort-wearing Swede has turned his attention to the drop bar world and modified his first gravel bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senior tech editor Dave Rome chats to Gustav about the new build, the design process of such bikes, and DIY paint. If you haven’t already, then <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/dangerholms-custom-7-13-kg-scott-addict-gravel-is-a-work-of-art/\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the full feature on Dangerholm’s Scott Addict Gravel</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/c74257e0-deda-49fc-b2ea-551819ac9483.gif\" />     SUBSCRIBE TO THE ‘NERD ALERT’ PODCAST</strong><br />Never miss an episode.
