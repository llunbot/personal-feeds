Unity will also acquire the 275 engineers that build Weta's technology and \"a library of thousands of incredible assets.\"</p>\n<p>The Weta visual-effects team itself will remain as a standalone entity known as WetaFX, which will still be majority-owned by Jackson. Unity expects that entity to \"become Unity’s largest customer in the Media and Entertainment space.\" <a href=\"https://www.wetaworkshop.com/\">Weta Workshop</a>, which focuses on practical effects and props, will also remain separate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811842#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811842&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2fd5671ea11b348760e665e8593c7041356e22bf427b74e790d1c77404fcdcd3","category":"Tech"}
