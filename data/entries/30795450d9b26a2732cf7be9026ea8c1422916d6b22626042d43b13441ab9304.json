Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts a half hour later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Air-and-iPad-Pro-11-inch-and-13-inch-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nKeep reading for some key things to know about the quarter, including a recap of new products announced, revenue expectations, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Products During Quarter</h2>\r<br />\nThe quarter ran from March 31 through June 29, according to Apple's fiscal calendar. The following products launched during this period:<ul><li>11-inch iPad Pro with M4 chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>13-inch iPad Pro with M4 chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>11-inch iPad Air with M2 chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>13-inch iPad Air with M2 chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple Pencil Pro</li>\r<br />\n<li>Vision Pro pre-orders in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/vision-pro-launching-in-more-countries/\">eight additional countries</a></li></ul><h2>Revenue Expectations</h2>\r<br />\nApple has not provided formal revenue guidance since before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the average Wall Street estimate for Apple's third quarter revenue is $84.5 billion, according to data compiled by <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis/\"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a>. This would be around a 3% increase over the $81.8 billion revenue the company reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-3q-2023-results/\">in the year-ago quarter</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis would be in line with the outlook that Apple's CFO provided on last quarter's earnings call:<blockquote>We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points.</blockquote><h2>Conference Call</h2>\r<br />\nCook and Maestri will hold a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Thursday to discuss the company's quarterly earnings results. The call should last around one hour, and it will include a Q&amp;A segment with analysts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA live audio stream of the conference call will be available on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\">Apple's Investor Relations page</a>, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\r<br />\nApple's current quarter runs through September 28, and the company has yet to announce any new products during this period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAAPL is trading for around $223 as of writing, down from a 52-week high of $237.23.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">Earnings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/apple-q3-2024-earnings-preview/\">What to Expect From Apple's Quarterly Earnings Report This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-quarterly-earnings-report-this-week.2432616/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"30795450d9b26a2732cf7be9026ea8c1422916d6b22626042d43b13441ab9304","category":"Apple"}
