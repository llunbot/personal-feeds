This was the first publicly released image of space debris captured from another spacecraft using rendezvous and proximity operations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040176#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040176&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8367a4fe33f0e67281f3393b19b82e945ff3077b3c9224ae2f7ef2f2377d851c","category":"Tech"}
