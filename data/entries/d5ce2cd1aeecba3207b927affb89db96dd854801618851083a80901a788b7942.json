The move is part of Apple’s strategy to offer\nmore compelling software features to counter declining sales in\nthe country, where it faces increasing competition from domestic\nbrands like Huawei and Vivo.</p>\n\n<p>Apple and Alibaba have submitted the Chinese AI features they\nco-developed for approval by China’s cyberspace regulator, the\nperson added, indicating that the partnership has gained\nsignificant progress. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone maker began testing different AI models from prominent\nChinese AI developers beginning in 2023 and last year selected\nBaidu as the primary partner, said two of the people. But the\ncollaboration <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-hits-snags-adapting-baidus-ai-models-for-china-users?rc=5pjqe5\">ran into snags</a> because Baidu’s progress in\ndeveloping its models for Apple Intelligence fell short of Apple\nstandards.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, Apple in recent months started to consider other\noptions, assessing models developed by Tencent, ByteDance,\nAlibaba, as well as Deepseek, said two people with direct\nknowledge of the matter. Apple eventually passed over Deepseek’s\nmodels because the Deepseek team lacked the manpower and\nexperience required to support a large customer like Apple, said\none of the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/information-apple-alibaba\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d5ce2cd1aeecba3207b927affb89db96dd854801618851083a80901a788b7942","category":"Tech"}
