It has been lauded because of its blend of competitive price and performance, and at Track Days you can test the same spec that <em>Cyclist </em>writer Laurence Kilpatrick reviewed: with a power meter-equipped SRAM Force AXS groupset, Zipp 404 Firecrest wheels and 28mm Michelin Power Cup tyres. That build retails for £5,000 and a size Large hit our scales at 7.8kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read Laurence’s full review <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/van-rysel-rcr-road-bike-review\">here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Van Rysel RCR will be at the following Track Days events:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>26<sup>th</sup> April 2025, Odd Down Cycle Track Bath,<br />17<sup>th</sup> May 2025, Lee Valley VeloPark London,<br />7<sup>th</sup> June 2025, The Brownlee Centre, Leeds</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on Cyclist Track Days click <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-information\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/cyclist-track-days-2025-3855053\" target=\"_blank\">BOOK YOUR TICKET HERE</a></strong></h3>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-information\">Cyclist Track Days 2025 info and how to get tickets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/van-rysel-rcr-road-bike-review\">Van Rysel RCR road bike review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/van-rysel\">Making the dream work: Behind the scenes at Van Rysel</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-van-rysel-rcr\">Cyclist Track Days 2025 bikes #1: Van Rysel RCR</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124;
