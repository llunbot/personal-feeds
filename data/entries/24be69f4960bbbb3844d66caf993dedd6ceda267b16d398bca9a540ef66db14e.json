But this Black Friday sale makes it a steal: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ73CFS/\">Amazon is selling the Apple Watch SE for just $149 (40mm)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ2NM9S/\">$179 (44mm)</a>, a savings of $100 on either model and by far the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE 2nd gen delivers everything you could need from a smartwatch — you can access all your notifications, text, answer calls, control media playback — as well as all the best parts of fitness trackers, like heart rate monitoring and tracking workouts, including swimming. The model also comes with some extra features like fall and crash detection, in which case your watch can call for help on your behalf. There’s also an emergency SOS feature for any time when you feel unsafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, it may not have as large of a display as the Series 10, for instance, or all the fancy sensors, but ultimately, do those even matter enough to pay more than $200 more? So if you’d rather have a watch that can track your activity and handle your calls and messages, go grab <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ73CFS/\">the Apple Watch SE 2nd for $149</a> because this Black Friday deal won’t last forever.</p>\n\n\n<span>This is officially the most affordable Apple Watch</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ73CFS/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"24be69f4960bbbb3844d66caf993dedd6ceda267b16d398bca9a540ef66db14e","category":"Apple"}
