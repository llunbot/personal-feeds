Martin</a> has instead added a different item to his long list of publications: a peer-reviewed physics paper just published in the American Journal of Physics that he co-authored. The paper derives a formula to describe the dynamics of a fictional virus that is the centerpiece of the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards\">Wild Cards</a></em> series of books, a shared universe edited by Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass, with some 44 authors contributing.</p>\n<p><em>Wild Cards</em> grew out of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superworld\"><em>Superworld</em></a> RPG, specifically a long-running campaign game-mastered by Martin in the 1980s, with several of the original sci-fi writers who contributed to the series participating. (A then-unknown Neil Gaiman once pitched Martin a <em>Wild Cards</em> story involving a main character who lived in a world of dreams. Martin rejected the pitch, and Gaiman's idea became <em>The Sandman</em>.) Initially, Martin planned to write a novel centered on his character Turtle, but he then decided it would be better as a shared universe anthology. Martin thought that superhero comics had far too many sources of the many different superpowers and wanted his universe to have one single source. Snodgrass suggested a virus.</p>\n<p>The series is basically an alternate history of the US in the aftermath of World War II. An airborne alien virus, designed to rewrite DNA, had been released over New York City in 1946 and spread globally, infecting tens of thousands worldwide. It's called the Wild Card virus because it affects every individual differently. It kills 90 percent of those it infects and mutates the rest. Nine percent of the latter end up with unpleasant conditions—these people are called Jokers—while 1 percent develop superpowers and are known as Aces. Some Aces have \"powers\" that are so trivial and useless that they are known as \"deuces.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/george-r-r-martin-has-co-authored-a-physics-paper/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/george-r-r-martin-has-co-authored-a-physics-paper/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ec8f5eec6949689101eed11bd727ad1f9d386d937cdc59f2aec07ea76a92d0d","category":"Tech"}
