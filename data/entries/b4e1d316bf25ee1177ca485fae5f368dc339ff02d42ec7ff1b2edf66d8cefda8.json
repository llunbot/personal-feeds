Nano Worx is at it again with a new product. But this time there will be no watt savings. Introducing their new Nano Worx <a href=\"https://nanoworx.shop/collections/tools-coming-soon/products/hook-lever-multi-tool\" target=\"_blank\">Hook Lever Multi-Tool</a> – it’s compact, lightweight, and very clever.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-profile-jpeg-e1731342396859.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"887\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-profile-jpeg-e1731342396859.webp\" alt=\"Nano Worx Hook Lever Tool profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-profile-jpeg-e1731342396859.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-profile-jpeg-e1731342396859-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-profile-jpeg-e1731342396859-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-profile-jpeg-e1731342396859-768x532.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Nano Worx)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nano Worx Hook Lever Multi-Tool integrates a tire lever with three cleverly stowed tool bits in the handle. The bits are slid into the handle, one on top of the other. Once they are inside the handle the included o-ring is stretched around it to secure the tool bits.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-with-bit-jpeg-e1731342350780.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"584\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-with-bit-jpeg-e1731342350780.webp\" alt=\"Nano Worx Hook Lever Tool with bit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-with-bit-jpeg-e1731342350780.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-with-bit-jpeg-e1731342350780-297x136.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-with-bit-jpeg-e1731342350780-120x55.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-with-bit-jpeg-e1731342350780-768x350.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool uses an integrated magnet that holds the bits in place while in use and keeps them quiet when stowed. The Nano Worx Hook Lever Multi-Tool looks great for the rider who needs to free up space and lighten up a saddle bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-side-shot-jpeg-e1731342380628.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"277\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-side-shot-jpeg-e1731342380628.webp\" alt=\"Nano Worx Hook Lever Tool side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-side-shot-jpeg-e1731342380628.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-side-shot-jpeg-e1731342380628-297x64.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-side-shot-jpeg-e1731342380628-120x26.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-side-shot-jpeg-e1731342380628-768x166.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buyer’s Choice…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering the three “buyer’s choice” bits is a unique way for the rider to stow only the tools used the most. The choices are three of the following: M6, M5, M4, M3, or a T25. With a combo of an M6 (highly recommended for axle removal), M5, and the T25 you can make simple adjustments to your steed. Add the integrated tire lever and you have what you need for a trailside flat repair. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-weight-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-weight-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Nano Worx Hook Lever Tool weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-weight-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-weight-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-weight-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nano-Worx-Hook-Lever-Tool-weight-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retail and Detail </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $40</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum torque: 20Nm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 40g (<em>fully assembled with 3 bits included</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dimensions: 11cm long, 2.3cm tapering to 1.5cm wide</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out all of the cool bike stuff Nano Worx has to offer by hitting the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://nanoworx.shop/\" target=\"_blank\">NanoWorx.shop</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nano-worx-tire-hook-lever-multi-tool/\">Nano Worx Tire Hook Lever Multi-Tool Includes Three Bits, Weighs Only 40g</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b4e1d316bf25ee1177ca485fae5f368dc339ff02d42ec7ff1b2edf66d8cefda8","category":"Cycling"}
