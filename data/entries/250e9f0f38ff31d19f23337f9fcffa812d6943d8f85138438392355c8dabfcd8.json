Obsidian is a remarkably flexible and powerful writing and note-taking app that is designed to adapt to the way you think. Obsidian helps you create connections and links between your notes so you can organization your thoughts. You can create links between everything — ideas, articles, lists, locations, books — anything you can put in a note, you can link to other notes.</p>\n\n<p>Obsidian’s guiding principles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Free for personal use</li>\n<li>Available on all operating systems</li>\n<li>Interoperable, local Markdown files</li>\n<li>No tracking, no account required</li>\n<li>Private, end-to-end encrypted</li>\n<li>Easy to modify with API, plugins, and themes</li>\n<li>100% user-supported, no VC funding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obsidian exemplifies the mindset of a proper power-user tool: it makes easy things easy, and hard things possible. It’s also the sort of Markdown-based tool that does things with Markdown that I never would have imagined when I created it. </p>\n\n<p>They’re offering a special deal for DF readers: sign up for their optional add-on sync service, Obsidian Sync, by 1 January 2024 and you’ll get 5 times the storage space — 50 GB for the price of 10 GB.
