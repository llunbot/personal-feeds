The iPhone 16 Pro will look almost exactly like the iPhone 15 Pro","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2193074/iphone-16-pro-max-mockups-new-button-identical-design.html","date":1704467933000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time when each new iPhone version would be distinctly different from the previous generation. But ever since the iPhone 12, Apple has stuck to the same general design each year, and from the looks of it, the iPhone 16 will bring more of the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on “new information” about Apple’s 2024 handsets, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/iphone-16-pro-design/&amp;xcust=1-1-2193074-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors has posted</a> “a series of mockups based on Apple’s internal designs,” but you’d be forgiven if you assumed they were posting images of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. The phones look nearly identical with one exception: There’s a new button below the power button.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 pro mockups based on rumors\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/macrumors-iphone-16-pro-mockups.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>These aren’t the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max—they’re mockups of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>MacRumors</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not the kind of change that’s likely to qualify as a must-have upgrade, but MacRumors shares a couple of other tidbits that might: Both models are getting slightly larger screens (6.3 inches and 6.9 inches versus 6.1 and 6.7), and both phones will have a 5X telephoto camera. The tetraprism telephoto camera is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which got a starting price hike to $1,199 along with a bump to 256GB of storage. MacRumors doesn’t say whether the iPhone 16 Pro will get the same treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the images, which MacRumors cautions “are not quite finalized,” the new “Capture” button will be the same size as the power button and take the place of the mmWave antenna, which will shift to the left edge below the volume buttons. The button will reportedly be capacitive with force-sensor functionality and primarily be used for taking quick videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the phones appear to be identical, with the same buttons, shape, bezels, and titanium frame. While some reports have claimed that the iPhone 16 will shrink the Dynamic Island down to a circle thanks to some Face ID sensors moving under the display, MacRumors’ mockups show the same pill-shaped cutout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news and rumors related to this year’s flagship iPhone refresh, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 superguide</a>.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3cadeb7f1c4b197450eb27bbaab95a4dbb33118a5f49ba78484b4971225db656","category":"Apple"}
