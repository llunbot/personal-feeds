Tesla will reportedly present its plans tomorrow to expand production at the factory, from thee current level of approximately 250,000 cars per year to one million. The plan calls for the construction of a new assembly hall that will be the size of 60 soccer fields, which is likely to draw opposition from local communities.

While Tesla once had a strong first-mover advantage and benefited from Musk's marketing savvy, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/experts-say-tesla-has-repeated-car-industry-mistakes-from-the-1980s/\">the company has frequently ignored the many hard-learned lessons</a> of the auto industry.</p>\n<p>Customers not turned off by Musk's antics instead are losing interest with a product line up of two EVs that are ancient in car years (the Models S and X) and two EVs that are merely old (the Models 3 and Y). The Models 3 and Y are also the only two vehicles that Tesla sells in volume. Any other automaker would have a second-generation Model 3 ready to go either this year or next, but at Tesla the product pipeline is empty.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020655#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020655&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
