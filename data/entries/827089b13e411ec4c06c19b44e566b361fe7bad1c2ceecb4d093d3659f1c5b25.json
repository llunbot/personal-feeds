There‚Äôs been so much racing recently, with the legendary Marianne Vos adding to her extensive palmar√®s after winning Stage 2 and the overall at the Volta Ciclista a Catalunya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Primo≈æ Rogliƒç <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-do-tour-de-france-favourites-prepare\" target=\"_blank\">geared up for the Tour de France</a> with a strong performance at the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, taking two stage victories and the overall. There was drama on Stage 5 however, with a mass crash on wet roads causing the race to be neutralised.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tour de Suisse, meanwhile, got underway on Sunday, Bryan Coquard (Cofidis ‚Äì I know, I can only picture him at Europcar too) sprinted to victory on Stage 2 while Yves Lampaert (Soudal-QuickStep) leads the overall standings after victory in the opening time-trial. The Giro Next Gen has also started, with Soudal-QuickStep Devo Team rider Paul Magnier currently leading the general classification.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-2024\">5 things we learnt at the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-do-tour-de-france-favourites-prepare\">How are the favourites preparing for the Tour de France?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-suisse-preview\">Men‚Äôs Tour de Suisse 2024: Route, how to watch, start list and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Tour de France Femmes 2024 route announced ft.

The news was announced alongside confirmation that Brittany will host next year‚Äôs <em>Grand D√©part</em>, with Stage 1 heading from Vannes to Plumelec, Stage 2 from Brest to Quimper and Stage 3 departing from La Gacilly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extra stage is another step in the right direction for the women‚Äôs sport, which has been growing steadily for several years now. As it stands, the nine-stage Tour de France Femmes will be the longest stage race for the women‚Äôs peloton. It has taken over from the Giro d‚ÄôItalia Donne, which was once ten days in length but has now been reduced to eight stages for the 2024 edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Derek Gee impresses at Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1865\" height=\"1049\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited.jpeg 1865w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited-970x546.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GPPWDU8W8AAykEq-edited-1140x641.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) impressed at the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, finishing in third overall at the eight-day race. He attacked the leading group of favourites in the final few hundred metres on Stage 3 to take his first WorldTour win and the leader‚Äôs jersey. The Canadian time-trial national champion then came home in sixth place on the Stage 4 ITT behind Remco Evenepoel before finishing in the top five on the final three staegs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>26-year-old Gee proved an exciting rider to watch at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2023\" target=\"_blank\">2023 Giro d‚ÄôItalia</a> ‚Äì prompting social media users to rename it the ‚ÄòGee-ro d‚ÄôItalia‚Äô ‚Äì as he consistently lit up the breakaway, leading to a flurry of second place finishes. While a Grand Tour podium may be unlikely for 2024, his potential as a stage race contender is something to keep an eye on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour of Britain Women proves fruitful for SD Worx-Protime‚Ä¶ until final stage</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>SD Worx Disasterclass <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62c.png\" alt=\"üò¨\" /><br /><br />The team that's dominated the Women's Tour of Britain miscommunicate and are pipped on the line by the Australian Champ Ruby Roseman-Gannon <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f926-200d-2642-fe0f.png\" alt=\"ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cycling?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#cycling</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/roadcycling?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#roadcycling</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenscycling?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#womenscycling</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rVswL5hfWx\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/rVswL5hfWx</a></p>‚Äî Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurosport/status/1799805299043303736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>SD Worx-Protime had fun at the Tour of Britain Women last week, but it wasn‚Äôt without drama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong group of contenders formed in the run-in to the Stage 1 finish in Llandudno and SD Worx‚Äôs World Champion Lotte Kopecky narrowly avoided being beaten by a fast-finishing Letizia Paternoster (Liv-Jayco-AlUla). In true Kopecky and SD Worx fashion, she won back-to-back stages, outsprinting Great Britain‚Äôs Anna Henderson the following day in Wrexham.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky‚Äôs teammate Lorena Wiebes put on a show in Warrington to win Stage 3, showing off her powerful sprint that won her all three stages of the RideLondon Classique. The team was all set to complete a clean sweep of this British leg of the season, but the final stage was to be their undoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky led the pack in the final straight but sat up in an attempt to gift the win to teammate Christine Majerus. However, it‚Äôs not over until it‚Äôs over. Majerus finished her effort and raised an arm just before the line and Australian road race and criterium champion Ruby Roseman-Gannon of Liv-AlUla-Jayco spoiled the party, slipping through the middle of the bunch and passing Wiebes, Kopecky and Majerus to get her first WorldTour victory in Leigh..¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was spectacular viewing. Kopecky still won overall though, with Henderson second and Majerus third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-2024\">5 things we learnt at the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-do-tour-de-france-favourites-prepare\">How are the favourites preparing for the Tour de France?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-suisse-preview\">Men‚Äôs Tour de Suisse 2024: Route, how to watch, start list and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Tour de France Femmes 2024 route announced ft.
