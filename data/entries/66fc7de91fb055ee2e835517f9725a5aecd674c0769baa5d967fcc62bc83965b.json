The companies now sell genuine parts for Google's latest flagship phones: <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Google_Pixel_8\">the Pixel 8</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Google_Pixel_8_Pro\">8 Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>The most common replacement will probably be the screen, which costs $160 for the Pixel 8 and $230 for the Pixel 8 Pro. The product described as a \"rear case\" is the entire aluminum body of the phone, with the rear glass, camera bar, camera cover glass, side buttons, and charging coil. The Pixel 8 version of this will run you $143, while the 8 Pro version is $173. The batteries are both $43.</p>\n<p>If your camera breaks, get ready for some serious sticker shock: The Pixel 8 Pro rear camera assembly is $200 for the bundled set of three cameras. For reference, a Galaxy S23 Ultra camera assembly (four cameras) is <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/products/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-rear-camera\">$142</a> from iFixit, while the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/products/iphone-14-pro-rear-camera-assembly\">iPhone 14 Pro Max rear camera assembly</a> is $150. Interestingly, the Pixel 8 also has $200 worth of camera parts despite having one less camera by skipping the complicated periscope zoom lens. The Pixel 8 parts come in separate pieces: $143 for the main camera and $63 for the ultra-wide. This is a ton of money to spend on the camera portion of a phone, and while that's great for shutterbugs, for people more focused on productivity uses, it would be nice not to have to pay for all this. Along with the $43 front camera, a Pixel 8 is $700 and has $243 worth of camera parts!</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993185#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993185&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66fc7de91fb055ee2e835517f9725a5aecd674c0769baa5d967fcc62bc83965b","category":"Tech"}
