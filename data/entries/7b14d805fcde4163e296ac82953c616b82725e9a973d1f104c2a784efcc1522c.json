{"title":"Transmit Drops Support for Google Drive Because of Google’s Overbearing Annual Code Inspections","link":"https://blog.panic.com/end-of-the-road-for-google-drive-and-transmit/","date":1728435288000,"content":"\n<p>Panic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Well, Google has a new set of policies that require apps that\nconnect to Google Drive to go through expensive, time-consuming\nannual reviews, and this has made it extremely difficult for us to\nreasonably maintain Google Drive access. You may have seen <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/our-android-app-is-frozen-in-carbonite\">iA\nWriter’s announcement</a> that they are stopping development of\ntheir Android version for similar reasons. Our experience was\ndifferent, but our circumstances are similar. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Between the weeks of waiting, submitting the required\ndocumentation and the process of scanning the code, it took a\nsignificant amount of time from our engineers. For example, Google\nprovided a Docker image for running the scanner, but it didn’t\nwork. We had to spend more than a week debugging and fixing it.\nAnd because the scanner found no problems, it didn’t result in any\nimprovements to Transmit. No one benefitted from this process. Not\nGoogle, not Panic, and not our users. [...]</p>\n\n<p>But then… a couple of months later, <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1b483a6/end_of_google_drive_integration/\"><em>Google completely removed\nthe option for us to scan our own code</em></a>. Instead, to keep\naccess to Google Drive, <em>we would now have to pay one of Google’s\nbusiness partners to conduct the review.</em> They promised a\ndiscounted minimum price, but no maximum price. We realized that\neither we’d most likely be paying someone else a chunk of cash to\nrun the same scanner we were running, or our bill would end up\nmuch higher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Never been gladder that I don’t use Google Drive for anything.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/08/panic-google-drive\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7b14d805fcde4163e296ac82953c616b82725e9a973d1f104c2a784efcc1522c","category":"Tech"}
