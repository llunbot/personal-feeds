{"title":"You Can Register Domain Names in iOS’s iCloud Settings","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213158","date":1683061437000,"content":"\n<p>I knew that iOS 16 introduced support for custom domain names for iCloud+ Mail — bring your own domain name but use iCloud as your email provider and web interface. Here’s a thing I only learned today though: you can register <em>new</em> domain names right in iOS 16’s Settings apps: iCloud Account → iCloud → iCloud Mail → Custom Email Domain.</p>\n\n<p>In their support document, Apple states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A third-party registrar handles the sale of each domain. For\nbilling or refund issues, contact them for support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For me (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/ios-16-icloud-mail-domain-registration.png\">screenshot</a>) that’s Cloudflare (whose caching and SSL services I use for Daring Fireball — fantastic company). Not sure if that’s true worldwide, or if Apple has other registrar partners in other countries.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/icloud-plus-domain-name-registration\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6b7706465b40ced08059a1f67c842d0e4c24162e71a7275b3e624c8a68a0b290","category":"Tech"}
