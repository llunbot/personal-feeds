Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> introduced them as a completely new Mac product category and a powerful new display designed for creative professionals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Mac Studio‌ is positioned between the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>. The first model featured the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a> or the newly introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-ultra/\">M1 Ultra</a> chip, offering the best performance of any Mac at the time. The base ‌M1 Max‌ model started at $1,999, while the ‌M1 Ultra‌ variant began at $3,999. Fully configured, the ‌M1 Ultra‌ model could exceed $8,000. Many saw the ‌Mac Studio‌ and Studio Display as the spiritual successor to the 27-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, which was discontinued on the same day as the ‌Mac Studio‌'s launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn June 2023, during the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Max and ‌M2‌ Ultra chip options for the ‌Mac Studio‌. Enhancements included support for up to six 6K monitors and improved connectivity options, such as Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E.   \r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this week, Apple introduced the latest iteration of the ‌Mac Studio‌, now featuring the M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips. The M4 Max offers a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU, starting with 36GB of RAM, while the M3 Ultra boasts a 32-core CPU and up to an 80-core GPU, with configurations supporting up to 512GB of RAM. Both models include Thunderbolt 5 ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Studio Display marked Apple's reentry into the consumer display market after more than a decade of absence. Prior to its release, Apple only offered one high-end professional monitor in the form of 2019's Pro Display XDR, which was aimed at a niche audience with a price tag of $4,999, without a stand. The Studio Display introduced a more accessible option for the wider range of users looking for a high-quality, premium external monitor that works well with Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors suggest that Apple is developing a new Studio Display model with mini-LED backlighting, expected to be released later in 2025 or early 2026. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/08/mac-studio-and-studio-display-turn-three-today/\">Mac Studio and Studio Display Turn Three Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-studio-and-studio-display-turn-three-today.2452480/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"712af825341b998748b6ee975c6c1398f3b8ffb3f2ea8d0575dbcdc13844cbaa","category":"Apple"}
