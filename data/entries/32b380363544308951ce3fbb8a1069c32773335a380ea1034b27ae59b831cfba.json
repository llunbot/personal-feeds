Today, we can finally share some news about how that will look. DT took their time, preserving everything that makes Trickstuff so desirable. We asked DT for the deets, so here is everything we know until we get our review set in later this season.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the brakes be any cheaper?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a new offering for the North American market. In the USA, MSRP/MAP for Maxima brake sets is $1,395, while MSRP/MAP for Direttissima and Piccola brake set models are $1,180.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Do you expect there will be a shorter waitlist?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Since Trickstuff was acquired by DT Swiss, one of the primary goals has been to improve availability. On top of process improvement, we have been building up stock at our global headquarters in Pfaffenweiler, Germany (where Trickstuff brakes are assembled) over the past year. We have done this in preparation to launch Trickstuff into North America.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have built up a safety stock of Trickstuff products in Grand Junction, CO. Since 1996, DT Swiss has had a subsidiary in Grand Junction, CO, which includes its <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/dt-swiss-grc-1100-diecut-30-and-50-review/\" target=\"_blank\">American service center</a> and production of spokes and wheels. With this in place, this has allowed us to add a Trickstuff service center, build up stock, and quickly support requests from partners and consumers.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that, on top of stock and service in Grand Junction, CO, we have partnered with a set of IBDs that will stock Trickstuff brakes from the time of launch. This is an expanding list but currently includes: Basalt Bike Ski / Cripple Creek Backcountry, Cyclepath PDX, Fanatik, Gravelo Workshop, Marin Service Course, and World Wide Cyclery.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Has Trickstuff increased its manufacturing capability?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, again, this has been a major priority over the past few years. The goal has been to increase capacity while still maintaining the premium qualities Trickstuff has come to be known for.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the brakes and service parts be sold through retailers or consumer-direct?</strong></p>\n<p>For brake systems, we will work directly with key IBDs. Over time, we intend to add additional partner IBD’s as demand and inventory can support. Our IBD partners will also have access to the majority of our service parts, tools and accessories so they are able to support customers quickly.</p>\n<p>Additionally, distributor BTI will stock service parts, tools, and accessories. Any IBD with a BTI account will have access to these items.<br />\nLastly, as noted previously, we have a full US-based Service Center at DT Swiss, USA in Grand Junction, CO. Should there be any service or warranty needs that shops are unable to address, our team can support quickly via this Service Center.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-1-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Will there be any US assembly of brake systems?</strong></p>\n<p>For now, all of our brake assembly will continue to take place at Tricksuff’s global headquarters in Pfaffenweiler, Germany.</p>\n<p><strong>Can customers still mix and match some levers and calipers?</strong></p>\n<p>It depends.</p>\n<p>All possible pump and caliper combinations are represented in our product line already. Some of the models do share components, though, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Maxima and the Direttissima both use the same pump body with different levers and different calipers.</li>\n<li>The Direttissima and Piccola HD use the same caliper with different pumps.</li>\n<li>The Piccola HD and the Piccola Carbon share the same pump body with different levers and different calipers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not be offering custom color builds like we have done in the past. The number of moving parts with build customization like this led to constraints. To improve capacity and lead times, we have refined and distilled product options. That said, from time to time, we will offer special edition options like the recently released <a href=\"https://www.trickstuff.com/en/special-series/direttissima-arctic-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Direttissima Artic Blue</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_trickstuff-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Are there any OEM discussions happening?</strong></p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><strong>Will all models in the Trickstuff catalog be available in the US?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, all models will be available in the US. We have built up stock of all models, with stock increasing for the final addition to US inventory: Piccola Carbon. We will begin to see quantities of the Piccola Carbon in the US market starting in June, with additional quantities available later in 2025.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.trickstuff.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Trickstuff</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/trickstuff_comes_to_us_market/\">Trickstuff Announces Piccola HD Brakes and Entry into the US Market</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"32b380363544308951ce3fbb8a1069c32773335a380ea1034b27ae59b831cfba","category":"Cycling"}
