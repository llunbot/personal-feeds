Now Gurman says Apple could completely skip the M3 generation for some Macs, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-likely-planning-to-skip-m3-mac-mini/\">most notably the Mac mini</a>.</p>\n<p>To be clear, Gurman doesn't have specific insider information confirming that Apple is planning to skip the M3 mini. But based on Apple's alleged late-2024-into-early-2025 timeline for the M4 mini, he believes that it's \"probably safe to say\" that there's not enough space on the calendar for an M3 mini to be released between now and then.</p>\n\n<p>This wouldn't be the first time an Apple Silicon Mac had skipped a chip generation—the 24-inch iMac was never updated with the M2, instead jumping directly from the M1 to the M3. The Mac Pro also skipped the M1 series, leapfrogging from Intel chips to the M2.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019034#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019034&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9bfb5d2bf244c1a97e9db9f94374d572f6e0b4a5d6cb68426e1c72b284520bdf","category":"Tech"}
