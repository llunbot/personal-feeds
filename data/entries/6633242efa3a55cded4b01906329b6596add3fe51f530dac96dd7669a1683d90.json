After an opening week through Portugal and southern Spain, the riders will continue the chaos into Galicia for week two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben O’Connor currently wears the leader’s <em>maillot rojo</em> with a lead of 3m53sec to<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\"> Primož Roglič </a>and 4m32sec to Richard Carapaz in third. In the other classifications, Wout van Aert wears the green jersey, Florian Lipowitz is in white and Adam Yates wears the polka dot jersey. Four riders wore the red jersey during the opening week and we had seven different stage winners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a check on who the winners and losers are after the first week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Ben O’Connor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-970x647.png\" alt=\"ben o'connor decathlon vuelta a espana 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120944.000.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage winner from the breakaway on Stage 6, Ben O’Connor has become a key protagonist at this Vuelta a España. Already a Grand Tour leader for his Decathlon-AG2R squad, the Australian has a proven track record in Grand Tours with a fourth place at the Tour de France as well as at the Giro d’Italia earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man from Perth has completed a trilogy of Grand Tour stage wins after a Giro win in 2020 and a Tour victory in 2021. Now with a Vuelta stage under his belt, he has become the 111th rider to win stages at all three Grand Tours. In his final big tour for the French team, O’Connor is looking to leave the team on a high note. Given that this is the first time Decathlon have led the Vuelta in their three-decade-long history, this is a huge leap forward for the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this impressive ride, O’Connor has taken the overall lead by quite some margin. While <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a> and UAE Team Emirates played with fire in the chasing peloton, O’Connor capitalised on the confusion to extend his lead to a comfortable gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will the risk pay off for O’Connor and Decathlon-AG2R? How long can he stay in the hunt for the red jersey? With a lead of 3m53sec, he’s looking to emulate the feat of Sepp Kuss last year and become a breakaway Grand Tour winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Second chances</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-970x647.png\" alt=\"adam yates\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T102452.048.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first week of the Vuelta has been all about second chances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a weak opening to the race, Ben O’Connor scored a stage win from the breakaway and a big buffer in the red jersey standings. Later in the race, Richard Carapaz, David Gaudu and Adam Yates all ventured in the break on Stage 9 with the goal of gaining back time in the GC standings. This was mostly successful, at least for Carapaz and Yates. After Almeida dropped out of the race, Yates’s breakaway successes threw him back into the GC fight. For Carapaz, he’s now in with a real shot of making the podium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These riders are all great GC riders in their own right, with a history of making the top five at three-week races. They’ve received a lifeline here to hunt GC – a second chance to get onto the final podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve missed GC snakes and ladders in recent Grand Tours. It’s good to see it back alive and kicking. This proves that you can still hang around in the GC standings even if you have a couple of off-days along the way. It has also made for some unpredictable and hectic racing.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/young-riders-vuelta-a-espana\">The 8 young riders to watch at the Vuelta a España</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-climbs\">The climbs that will decide the Vuelta a España 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a España 2024: Route, start list, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2024: Route, start list, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Pavel Bittner</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T103845.016.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Czech fastman Pavel Bittner came into the Vuelta on scorching form. He claimed stages at the Vuelta a Burgos and was right in the thick of it in his home race, the Czech Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, at the Vuelta, Bittner took a huge step up. After some strong top ten performances on Stages 2 and 3, Bittner was knocking at the door for a big result. In a bike throw on Stage 5, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\">DSM-Firmenich-PostNL</a> sprinter edged out Wout van Aert to stage glory. In dethroning Van Aert, Bittner has made quite the name for himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just 21-years-old, the young sprinter has more opportunities to come in the Vuelta a España. This win also comes at a crucial time for DSM as they hang onto<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\"> their UCI WorldTour license</a> by the skin of their teeth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Young climbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-970x647.png\" alt=\"lennart van eetvelt vuelta a espana 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T120503.230.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vuelta is often <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/young-riders-vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">a playground for young riders</a> looking to make a name for themselves in the Grand Tour cycle. This Vuelta has followed this trend with some promising rides so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost a stage winner atop the Pico Villeurcas, Lennart van Eetvelt was evidently frustrated with his close call on Stage 4. He raised his arms a little too early, but later translated this into a ferocious bar slam of annoyance. Lotto-Dtsny’s Van Eetvelt has made his ambitions of a top ten clear.

Roglič was almost dropped by the young Lipowitz on Stage 9 while Red Bull-Bora-Hangrohe gambled with the red jersey and gave the lead to O’Connor. Roglič also had to put out a big Enric Mas-shaped fire on Stage 9 when the Spaniard attacked on the final climb. It’s been a week of typical Roglič highs and lows, let’s say that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t beat him up though. He’s won two stages already and currently sits as the ‘best of the rest’ behind O’Connor. Roglič’s advantage over Carapaz is 39 seconds and Mas sits 42 seconds at bay. At this point of the race, Roglič has shown signs of being the most likely winner of this Vuelta – that’s if O’Connor’s advantage melts away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being in the shadow of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vingegaard-rivalry\" target=\"_blank\"> Pogačar and Vingegaard</a>, Roglič’s time to win a Grand Tour might have returned once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: João Almeida</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Joao Almeida Vuelta 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-24.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many picked João Almeida out as a GC favourite.<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-espana-predictions-2024\" target=\"_blank\"> 75% of us here at <em>Cyclist </em>picked Almeida</a> for red before the race. In a Vuelta that started in his home nation, Almeida was a candidate for victory after having remained just a handful of seconds behind Roglič in the GC after seven stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tables turned on Stage 8 when Almeida was spotted at the rear end of the peloton in deep trouble. At the end of the stage, he lost five minutes and it soon emerged that he had contracted Covid, forcing him to pull out of the Vuelta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Emirati team now need to figure out a new strategy in the race. With Yates winning the following stage and re-entering top ten, perhaps this has been resolved. It’s likely that the team’s brute force will now be used to hunt more stages and claw back time in the GC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Thermometers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-27T111802.292.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Who knew holding a bike race in southern Spain in August would be so hot?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The temperatures at the Vuelta have hit 40°C, with thermometers firmly ticking around the mid-30s during the opening week. In post-race interviews, riders have complained about the heat and its consequences on the race. We have become accustomed to ice jackets, cool-down bidons and even firefighters spraying their hoses on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heat has characterised this first week, and not in a good way. Antonio Tiberi had to abandon the race due to heat stroke during Stage 9’s scorcher to Granada. In doing so, Tiberi ceded the white jersey to Florian Lipowitz and dropped out of the top ten of the GC standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-vuelta-weather-swap\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Why don’t we swap the dates of the Giro and the Vuelta?</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Lidl-Trek</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-970x646.jpeg\" alt=\"lidl trek\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-1140x759.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GVbZo7AXMAEV-dl.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Lidl-Trek/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I’m picking on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a>, but I have been incredibly underwhelmed by the American team. In a week when <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/weird-grand-tour-starts\" target=\"_blank\">a stage began inside a supermarket</a>, <em>that </em>has been the biggest talking point for the Lidl-Trek riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mattias Skjelmose sits outside the top ten and Giulio Ciccone hasn’t featured and has now abandoned. Patrick Konrad and Carlos Verona haven’t been too visible while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tao-geoghegan-hart-interview-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Tao Geoghegan Hart</a> has had a poor start to say the least. The British rider spoke before the race of being able to compete at the Vuelta. In reality, he is over one hour behind in the GC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from Mathias Vacek, the Lidl-Trek boys have been fairly incognito at the Vuelta so far.

Here we are again. The British superteam have missed that <em>je ne sais quoi</em> at the Vuelta. Heck, they have barely been on camera during the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlos Rodríguez has been fairly anonymous so far. He is not able to stick with the front group of climbers, but hasn’t dropped any big heaps of time yet. Maybe the best is yet to come for the 23-year-old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos’s back-up GC rider Thymen Arensman has been off the mark too. After Stage 7, he was checked out for possible heatstroke following the blisteringly hot stage to Cordoba. His losses in the GC now sit at just under one hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The European time-trial champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/josh-tarling-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Tarling </a>has also pulled out of the race after a crash on Stage 9. In his first Grand Tour Tarling failed to win the opening time-trial in Lisbon. After the busy Olympic period, Tarling missed the potential many saw of him in his debut Vuelta, though would’ve been better suited to the longer final TT.
