There really are enough cycling light sets on the market today to give you a headache, from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-daytime-riding-bike-lights\" target=\"_blank\">daylight riding cycling lights</a> to high-powered performance lights and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-cycling-lights-for-helmets-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">helmet lights</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you narrow down the best cycling light sets for you, we’ve compiled a list of our tried-and-tested favourites below, which range from budget-friendly urban options to a few more premium models designed for riding both on lit and unlit roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for our full, detailed buying advice below. You may be surprised to learn that there’s more to the quality of a light than the lumen output, and less surprisingly, often a compromise to be found between power, battery life, unit size and cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best bike lights</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exposure Sirius Mk10 + TraceR MK3 ReAKT Pack – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/exposure-sirius-mk10-tracer-mk3-reakt-pack-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cateye AMPP 200 / VIZ 100 Bike Light Set – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cateye-ampp-200-viz-100-bike-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Moon Meteor (400lm) &amp; Orion (50lm) – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/moon-meteor-400lm-orion-50lm-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lezyne Micro Drive 800+/Strip Drive 300+ LED Light Set – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lezyne-micro-drive-800-strip-drive-300-led-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ravemen FR300 and CL05 Light Set – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ravemen-fr300-and-cl05-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>How do we test and why trust our advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"chase_the_sun_3\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02121345/chase_the_sun_3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone is willing or able to hop on an <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">indoor trainer</a> as soon as the nights draw in and the weather turns south. Indeed, many of us still brave the daily commute by bike or get a real kick out of heading out into the elements when the conditions are less than favourable. For the year-round commuters, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/audax-stories\" target=\"_blank\">audax </a>champions and night-time mile munchers; we’ve got you covered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at <em>Cyclist</em>, we’ve tried and tested a huge selection of lights over the years, so you can trust that we’ll only recommend the lights that we really think are worth your hard-earned cash – whether that’s budget options that won’t underperform, or higher ticket options that do really offer a good value investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the light sets in this buyer’s guide has been thoroughly tested by us in a range of conditions, so you can be confident that they’re worthy of your consideration.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

Front lights tend to range from around 100 lumens to several thousand, while most rear lights tend to have an output of around 100 lumens or less. Rear lights designed for daytime use can often offer flashing modes with more than 100 lumens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many lumens you will need depends on what you plan on using your light for. If you need to your lights to be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/clear-as-day-best-daytime-running-lights-in-focus\" target=\"_blank\">seen in daylight</a> or semi-lit environments, then a lower powered light will be just fine. Contrastingly, if you need your front light to light your path on unlit roads, then you’ll really benefit from a higher-powered model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A word of caution; there’s more to the effectiveness of a light than the pure number of lumens. The pattern of LEDs and construction of the lens and reflective material within it also have a significant effect on how well a light can be seen. The Exposure TraceR rear light is a great example of this. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What other things do I need to look for when choosing the best bike lights for me?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important things to take into account when choosing cycling lights include the brightness and beam pattern, the battery life and of course, cost. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each manufacturer will list the claimed battery life for their lights for the different modes. Remember that you may not need to spend your whole ride using full power, especially if riding on lit roads or in a group, so you will likely be able to extend your battery life from the minimum by switching between a higher and lower powered setting intermittently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If battery life is key, you will find yourself looking at larger lights to accommodate larger batteries, whereas lights for short journeys like commuting that can be quickly charged before, during or after your working day can be really quite compact and lightweight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much should I spend on cycling light sets?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, you get what you pay for when it comes to cycling light sets. While you can get some sets cheaper, most budget sets start at around £40-£60. Mid-range sets will see a step-up in quality for around £100, while the most premium lights will set you back around £200. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price will depend on the construction of the lights (with more expensive options often featuring more durable CNC machined aluminium rather than plastic) the power of the lights, battery life, water resistance ratings and warranty duration. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the different types of mounts available?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulky plastic bolt-on brackets are largely a thing of the past; today most lights are attached to the handlebars or seat post using a combination of a plastic mount with a stretchy rubber strap. This allows the light to be attached to a much greater range of bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these mounts are universal, allowing you to use them with both standard and aero bars and seatposts, while others will require you to buy a separate mounts to accommodate or may come with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For off-road use, more secure mounts may be needed to counteract the bumps and vibration of rougher roads and trails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What degree of water resistance do I need for my bike lights?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most lights are rated on the IPX scale for water resistance or waterproofing, which is the Ingress Protection rating. Most lights are between IPX 4 and IPX 7, dependent on quality and price. Here’s what the different levels stand for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>IPX 0 No protection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IPX 1 Protects against dripping water or condensation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IPX 2 Protects against spraying water at angles up to 15°</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IPX 3 Protects against spraying water at angles up to 60°</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IPX 4 Protects against splashing of water from any angle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IPX 5 Protects against low pressure water stream from any angle </li>\n\n\n\n<li>IPX 6 Protects against high pressure water stream from any angle </li>\n\n\n\n<li>IPX 7 Protects from immersion in water up to 1 metre (for a minimum of 30 minutes)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing you can do to help keep your lights lasting for longer in wet weather or when riding on wet roads is to use them in conjunction with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\" target=\"_blank\">mudguards</a>, which significantly reduce the amount of road spray coming into contact with the lights. Your bum will thank you for them too.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Best road bike mudguards 2024: Bolt and clip-on fenders to keep you clean and dry</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\">Best winter cycling gloves 2024: Keep your hands warm in cold weather</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-winter-cycling-base-layers\">Best winter cycling base layers 2024: Keep warm on the bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-winter-cycling-socks\">Best winter cycling socks 2024: Keep your feet warm while riding in the cold</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\">Best smart turbo trainers: Top Zwift compatible indoor trainers</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-lights\">Best bike lights reviewed 2024: Front and rear light sets rated</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ba643c13b1f1a07486dea1ef41ae3156abe2618d721cdb3ef1eea923da1be5cd","category":"Cycling"}
