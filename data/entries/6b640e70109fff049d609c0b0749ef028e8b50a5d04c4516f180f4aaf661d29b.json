{"title":"Acorn 8.0","link":"https://shapeof.com/archives/2024/12/say_hello_to_acorn_8.html","date":1734478401000,"content":"\n<p>Gus Mueller:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is a major update of Acorn, and is currently on a\n<a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/store/?addapp=AC8\">time-limited sale for $19.99</a>. It’s still a one time\npurchase to use as long as you’d like, and as usual, the <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/releasenotes.html\">full\nrelease notes are available</a>. I want to highlight some of my\nfavorite things below.</p>\n\n<p>“Select Subject”, “Mask Subject”, and “Remove Background” are new\ncommands which use machine learning (or A.I. if you prefer) to\nfind the most important parts of your image, and then perform\ntheir respective operations. This has been a request for a long\ntime, and while I was doubtful of it’s utility, it’s actually\npretty fun to play with and more useful than I figured it would\nbe. So I’m glad I took the time to integrate it.</p>\n\n<p>You can now set your measurement units to inches, centimeter, or\npixels, and it shows up across the tools for your image, not just\nspecific ones. This includes the crop palette, shape dimensions,\nfilter settings… well, pretty much everything. This might be the\noldest feature request I’ve implemented so far. And then related\nto this, Acorn 8 now has an on canvas ruler which you can use to\nmeasure out distances, straighten your image with, or even\nredefine the DPI.</p>\n\n<p>Look up Table (LUT) support. LUTs are pretty fun, and they work by\nmapping one set of colors to another, enabling consistent or\nstylized visual effects. LUTs are used primarily in photography or\nfilmmaking, and you can download and install new LUTs from various\nplaces across the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And more, so much more. <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/releasenotes.html\">The release notes</a> are copious, and for me, always interesting. Acorn remains one of my most-used tools. It’s fast, reliable, powerful, extensible/scriptable, and the interface makes so much intuitive sense. That’s all been true since version 1.0 back in 2007, and that’s why it’s been my go-to image editor since it was in early beta <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/09/10/acorn\"><em>before</em> version 1.0 back in 2007</a>. It’s just faster and more powerful today.</p>\n\n<p>Acorn is, simply put, one of the best Mac apps ever made. It’s that good. You’re nuts (<em>sorry</em>) if you don’t check it out while it’s available for just $20.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/17/acorn-8\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6b640e70109fff049d609c0b0749ef028e8b50a5d04c4516f180f4aaf661d29b","category":"Tech"}
