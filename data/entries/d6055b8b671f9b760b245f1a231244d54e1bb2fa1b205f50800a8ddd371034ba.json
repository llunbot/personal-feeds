You can pay for cable or set up an HDTV antenna, but you have to hope it catches NBC, CBS, and Fox for Sunday games (if your local station chooses to carry your team), and for Monday night games, ABC (though most are on ESPN and some even exclusive to ESPN+). Thursday nights? That's Amazon Prime.</p>\n<p>Oh, and this year's Christmas Day games are on Netflix. And the games played in London and Germany are on the NFL Network, which requires either cable or an NFL+ subscription. And Peacock also had that one game in Brazil and is getting another playoff game this year. Many of these games get broadcast options in their home regions, though that doesn't much help ex-pat fans.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/nfl-player-illegally-streams-his-own-teams-game-garners-mostly-sympathy/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/nfl-player-illegally-streams-his-own-teams-game-garners-mostly-sympathy/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6055b8b671f9b760b245f1a231244d54e1bb2fa1b205f50800a8ddd371034ba","category":"Tech"}
