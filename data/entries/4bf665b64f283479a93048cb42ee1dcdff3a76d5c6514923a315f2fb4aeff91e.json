Quantum computing can be applied to a large range of problems, some of them considerably more complex than others. Utility will come for some of the simpler problems first, but further hardware progress is needed before we can begin tackling some of the more complex ones.</p>\n<p>One that should be easiest to solve involves modeling the behavior of some simple catalysts. The electrons of these catalysts, which are critical for their chemical activity, obey the rules of quantum mechanics, which makes it relatively easy to explore them with a quantum computer.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/researchers-optimize-simulations-of-molecules-on-quantum-computers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/researchers-optimize-simulations-of-molecules-on-quantum-computers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4bf665b64f283479a93048cb42ee1dcdff3a76d5c6514923a315f2fb4aeff91e","category":"Tech"}
