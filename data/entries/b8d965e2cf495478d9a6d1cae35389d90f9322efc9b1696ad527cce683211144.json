I’ve used all of the typical tools — scissors, pocket knife, box cutter — and many unconventional\nones like drywall saws just trying to make this painful job a\nbit easier.</p>\n\n<p>The CANARY is uniquely serrated all the way around its edge, like\na chainsaw. This makes it incredibly good at cutting cardboard\neither with or across corrugation with ease. I cannot express how\neasily this knife cuts cardboard, it’s like slicing through\nregular old paper, it’s amazing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last year when I linked to (and recommended) Studio Neat’s Keen — the world’s best box cutter, but which costs about $100 — at least one reader recommended the Canary. For $8 I figured why not. It truly is an amazing product. I do still love my prototype Keen but for opening and breaking down cardboard boxes, the Canary can’t be beat. It’s both highly effective and very safe.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/20/canary-knife\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b8d965e2cf495478d9a6d1cae35389d90f9322efc9b1696ad527cce683211144","category":"Tech"}
