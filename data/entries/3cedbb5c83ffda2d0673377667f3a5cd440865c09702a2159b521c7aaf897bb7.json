In the last 10 years, scientists have heatedly debated whether these unusual patterns are due to sand termites or to an ecological version of a self-organizing Turing mechanism. Last year, a team of scientists made a strong case for what they deemed definitive evidence of the latter, thus ruling out sand termites, but was their declaration of victory premature?</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143383192300029X?via%3Dihub\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics offers a four-point rebuttal of those 2022 findings, concluding that sand termites may be to blame after all. Meanwhile, the authors of that 2022 study have offered a counter-rebuttal to the rebuttal; there is currently <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4507988\">a preprint</a> undergoing peer review at the same journal.</p>\n<p>“The to and fro between opposing camps has often been nothing less than vitriolic,” Michael Cramer, an ecophysiologist at the University of Cape Town who has studied fairy circles, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/science/fairy-circles-cause-water-termites.html\">told The New York Times</a> last year. That's partly because of how challenging it is to definitively prove causation for “a long-lived ecological pattern that cannot be replicated in the lab”—however strenuously one side or the other may claim to have proven their case. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955177#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3cedbb5c83ffda2d0673377667f3a5cd440865c09702a2159b521c7aaf897bb7","category":"Tech"}
