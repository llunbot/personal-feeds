Look reckons that this is better than its competitors and improves pressure distribution and foot comfort. The new pedals have the same 53mm Q Factor and 14.8mm pedal-plus-cleat stack height (8.5mm for the pedal, 6.3mm for the cleat) as the previous model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the previous generation pedals, there are three spec levels: the Keo Blade Carbon is priced at £140; the Keo Blade Carbon Ceramic is priced at £200; the Keo Blade Carbon Ceramic Ti is priced at £300. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two pedals without titanium axles have a claimed 115g weight per pedal, while the top spec pedals reduce the claimed weight to 95g per pedal.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/look-keo-blade-carbon-ceramic-pedals-review\">Look Keo Blade Carbon Ceramic pedals review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-game-changer-look-clipless-pedals\">Cycling game changer: Look clipless pedals</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-ceramic-bearings-worth-it\">Are ceramic bearings worth it?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">Best road bike pedals 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Same blade spring tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-970x643.jpg\" alt=\"Look Keo Blade pedal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-1536x1019.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-750x497.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-1140x756.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1.jpg 1983w\" /><figcaption>Look</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Keo Blade has been a fixture of the pro scene since it was introduced in 2011, with two updates in 2014 and 2018. Star users have included Alberto Contador, Peter Sagan and most recently Tadej Pogačar. Look is promoting the new pedal with Eritrean sprinter/<em>puncheur</em> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Biniam Girmay</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each generation of the Keo Blade has featured a carbon leaf spring in place of a steel spring to tension the rear retainer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to a coiled steel spring Look says that the blade saves around 20% in weight and is also more aero and will last longer. Look’s measurements show that the initial tension as the foot is twisted outwards to disengage is higher with the carbon spring, so that the foot is held in place more firmly when riding, while a steel spring has a more linear release tension increase as the foot shifts outwards, even if the final release torque is similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look has retained the previous pedal’s range of four blades with different release tensions: 8, 12, 16 and 20Nm. The first three come fitted to different models in the line-up. The 20Nm blade is available as an aftermarket purchase only and Look stresses that it’s most appropriate for pro sprinters, rather than someone riding on open roads who might have to put a foot down quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look says that you can swap between springs in under a minute using the included tool. A replacement blade set costs around $50.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More durable and robust</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Look Keo Blade pedals\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/PAIRES_LOOK_KEO_BLADE_VUE_STAR_TI_1X1.jpg 1871w\" /><figcaption>Look </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look has also aimed to increase the new pedal’s robustness and durability. It has redesigned its spindle, eliminating the end cap, so that pro mechanics can’t wash out the bearings when pressure washing pros’ bikes. It has added new double-sealed bearings and is using new water-resistant grease too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The removal of the end cap also doubles the pedal’s impact resistance in the event of a crash or grounding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the top of the pedal, there’s a new three-part stainless steel contact surface with a larger surface area, the rear retainer shape has been redesigned and the pedal balance has been tweaked to make clipping in easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aero to be quantified</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pedals have been one of the few areas of the bike where no brand has made specific, quantified aero claims, despite Wahoo marketing a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-speedplay-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">Speedplay Aero</a> pedal and Time saying that its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/time-xpro-10-review\" target=\"_blank\">XPro models </a>are designed to be aero and Look claiming the same for the Keo Blade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems likely to change in the next few months, as Look says that it is working on quantifying the Keo Blade’s claimed aero benefits over its competitors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Availability and international pricing information</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-970x643.jpg\" alt=\"Look Keo Blade pedals\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-1536x1019.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-750x497.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-1140x756.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Look_Pedals_Keo-Blade-Ceramic-Ti-_1-1.jpg 1832w\" /><figcaption>Look </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new fourth generation Keo Blade pedal is available to buy now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard Keo Blade pedal with carbon body and steel bearings is priced at £139.99 / $174 / €145 and comes with an 8Nm blade spring.
