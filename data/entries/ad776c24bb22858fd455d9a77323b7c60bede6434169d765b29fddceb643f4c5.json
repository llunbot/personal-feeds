{"title":"Imagine How Powerful Meta Might Be Today If Their PR Wasn’t Run by Sycophantic Morons","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-book-mark-zuckerberg-defense-drawing-more-attention-2025-3","date":1742063614000,"content":"\n<p>Katie Notopoulos, writing at Business Insider (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AKBVv40CYTPea6iXqh-wl-A\">Apple News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s possible that this strident defense is backfiring — creating\na “<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gina-rinehart-portrait-australia-national-gallery-lesson-in-streisand-effect-2024-5\">Streisand Effect</a>” that’s publicizing the book even more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notopoulos isn’t one to pull punches or hedge, normally, but there’s no question that Meta has Streisand Effected the hell out of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4hGWXHH\">Wynn-Williams’s <em>Careless People</em></a>. I’m on my way to buy a copy this afternoon and I hadn’t even heard of its existence a day ago.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sarah Wynn-Williams worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2017 — and\nher <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-board-game-careless-people-sarah-wynn-williams-2025-3\">book, “Careless People</a>,” details what she said were a\nbunch of bad things the company did. It also contains allegations\nthat Joel Kaplan — who is now Meta’s chief global affairs officer — sexually harassed her. (Meta said this week that Kaplan had\nbeen cleared of the harassment allegations in 2017 after it\ninvestigated Wynn-Williams’ complaint.)</p>\n\n<p>The book was released with hardly any pre-publishing fanfare: It\nwas announced by its publisher, Flatiron Books, an imprint of\nMacmillan, only a few days before it came out Tuesday. That’s an\nunusually short timeline.</p>\n\n<p>Meta’s reaction has been emphatic and multi-pronged. The company\ncreated a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sarah-Wynn-Williams-New-Book-Of-Old-News.pdf\">page on its website</a> that detailed a series of\nthe claims in the book. It said some of these — like claims\nabout its ambitions in China or its alleged failure to act in\nMyanmar — have already been reported in the news media as far\nback as 2017 and have been acknowledged by the company publicly.\nThe company lists seven “new” claims from the book and then\noffers links to past coverage and company responses — calling\nthe claims “old news.”</p>\n\n<p>Meta’s strongest move was on Wednesday when it won <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-legal-win-bars-former-exec-promoting-book-careless-people-2025-3\">a ruling in\narbitration</a> that said Wynn-Williams could no longer promote\nthe book because of a non-disparagement clause in a contract she\nsigned as an employee. The ruling was granted on an emergency\nbasis and is temporary pending the completion of the full\narbitration process, The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/03/13/careless-people-facebook-meta-arbitration/\">reported</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“<em>Read the book that Meta not only doesn’t want you to read, but wants to prevent its author from even talking about</em>” is a hell of a marketing angle. What an own goal.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/15/meta-tries-to-squash-book\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ad776c24bb22858fd455d9a77323b7c60bede6434169d765b29fddceb643f4c5","category":"Tech"}
