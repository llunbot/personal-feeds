We’ve got some exciting content plans in the diary for the season ahead and will be bringing to life different ways of connecting<em> Rouleur’s </em>readers with our events throughout the year.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Focal Events founded Dirty Reiver in 2016 – the first and largest gravel event </span><span>in the UK</span><span>.</span><span> The 200km-long event (you can also ride the 130km and 65km routes) has become a rite of passage in the gravel world and a real test of stamina, skills and self-reliance. The event was based on the Gravel Grinder format found in the mid-west of America and sees riders traverse gravel forest access roads on the border regions of England and Scotland. It has grown in popularity since its inaugural event almost 10 years ago, and the 2025 event </span><span>sold out in a matter of hours, with 2,000 gravel riders making their way to Kielder in April</span><span>. Rouleur writer Rachel Jary rode the event in 2023 – you can read more about her experience </span><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/es-ca/blogs/desire-journal/riding-dirty-reiver-on-the-bmc-kaius-01-one-a-high-end-gravel-bike-made-for-racing?srsltid=AfmBOooo45kGUI8k6_hqCt7UuFqX_8XHgS2MTobmhaC9Za5Btdf1P5x_\" target=\"_blank\"><span>here</span></a></em><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Focal Events' other races have also become </span><span>important</span><span> events in the gravel calendar, and all have unique characteristics. </span><a href=\"https://gravelrocks.cc/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Gravel Rocks</span></a><span> is the </span><span>company’s</span><span> enduro-style gravel race with a festival atmosphere. The event in the North York Moors is spread across two days and includes experiences such as a 10km night ride, social rides, and family activities. However, the racing element includes seven timed stages over the two days. But there is a twist: the exact locations of the timed stages</span><span> “</span><span>remain a mystery until you discover them en route</span><span>” </span><span>according to the Gravel Rocks website. </span></p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/362A8795_1024x1024.jpg?v=1737992712\" /></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frontier300.cc/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Frontier 300</span></a><span> is a coast-to-coast challenge, which can be completed in one or two days on 6-8 June, from the Irish to the North Sea, journeying through the heart of the old Border Marches via quiet lanes and gravel trails. Focal Events also has another race in June, called </span><a href=\"https://www.dalbygrit.cc/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Dalby Grit</span></a><span> – it's a new gravel race </span><span>that’ll</span><span> be experienced</span><span> for the first time this year, the only one of its kind in England this year. </span><span>The 110km-long course is set within Dalby Forest on the southern edge of the North York Moors National Park and features over 1,800 metres of climbing, making it</span><span> a </span><span>challenging </span><span>race</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Later in the year, Focal Events runs </span><a href=\"https://www.justgravel.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Just Gravel Grizedale</span></a><span> in September. This event has three routes available for riders to choose from, including a route for families (15km), a route for fun (32km) and one that is aimed at challenging participants (45km). The event is for all abilities – with guaranteed places for female riders and families, free child entries and bursary places for those on low income – and takes place in the Lake </span><span>District’s</span><span> Grizedale Forest. </span></p>\n<p><span>Each of Focal </span><span>Events' </span><span>gravel races and challenges is in partnerships with a range of </span><span>cycling’s</span><span> biggest brands, including Panaracer, Crankbrothers, SCOTT, Wahoo, SRAM, Camelbak, Clif, POC, Lauf, Topeak,</span><span> Le Col, Ergon, Exposure Lights, Action Medical Research, and many more. <em>Rouleur</em> is delighted to now be amongst those supporting the </span><span>UK’s</span><span> best gravel events as Focal Events media partner. </span></p>\n<p>Are you taking part in one of these events?
