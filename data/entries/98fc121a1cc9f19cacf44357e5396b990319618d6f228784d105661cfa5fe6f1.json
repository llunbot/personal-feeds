While not yet tested in a wind tunnel, we’re confident that speed-conscious riders will appreciate its potential aerodynamic advantage over bulkier bags that overlook strap management</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Swing Prevention</strong><br /><em>A tight fit against the seatpost and saddle is crucial to prevent a seatbag from swinging during rides. Unlike bags with fixed strap positions, the Seat Pack’s adjustable strap system allows for a snug fit on various seatpost and saddle designs, ensuring nearly swing-free performance. Additionally, the adjustable system lets you fine-tune the bag’s angle to clear the back tire on smaller bikes</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compactness Over Volume</strong><br /><em>With a 4-liter capacity, the Seat Pack offers just enough space for a set of light clothes and toiletries. Its replaceable internal plastic sheet provides structure and maintains the bag’s shape when packed. Slots on the outside of the bag provide attachment points for lights and other accessories when needed</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Post Carry Co Lightweight Bikepacking Bags seat pak\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Post-Carry-Co-Lightweight-Bikepacking-Bags-seat-pak-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sizes: </strong>One size only</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>38 x 15x 12cm (rolled to biggest volume), 28 x 15 x 12cm (rolled to its smallest volume)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Capacity: </strong>4-liters</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 275g</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Materials: </strong>600D DWR coated polyester main fabric, PE plastic inner structure, Durable WJ non-slip buckles, Nylon webbing</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the collection and all of Post Carry Co’s offerings at the link below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://postcarry.co/\" target=\"_blank\">PostCarry.Co</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/post-carry-co-lightweight-speedpacking-bags/\">Post Carry Co Introduces New Lightweight “Speedpacking” Bags</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"98fc121a1cc9f19cacf44357e5396b990319618d6f228784d105661cfa5fe6f1","category":"Cycling"}
