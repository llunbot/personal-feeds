Ginther went on to say the data’s lack of integrity was likely the reason the ransomware group had been unable to auction off the data.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046614#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046614&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04f729be1fc9e39f4328cec0c5651b0153fdd59bb242e071aeebc72893b6659a","category":"Tech"}
