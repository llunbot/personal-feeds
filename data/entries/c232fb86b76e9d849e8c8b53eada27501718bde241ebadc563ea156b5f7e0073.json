Besides the M3 Pro chip, the laptop features 18G of unified memory and a 512GB SSD. Now that’s a powerhouse!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2211441/14-inch-m3-pro-macbook-pro-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed the MacBook Pro</a>, we gave it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. Among the things our expert raved about were the laptop’s great performance and the plentiful standard memory for the whole series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another really cool thing about the MacBook Pro M3 Pro is the solid battery life. Apple claims it lasts about 22 hours, and even if it doesn’t reach that much because you’re pushing it to its limits, you’ll still get a full workday out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is also worth mentioning because it delivers vibrant colors and up to 600 nits of brightness, ensuring a great viewing experience in all light conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The MacBook Pro M3 Pro proves to be a good work tool for everyday tasks. It’s noticeably faster than the MacBook Pro M3–the extra money you must pay to upgrade from the M3 to the M3 Pro is well spent money,” the review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our expert believed the $1999 price tag on this MacBook Pro was worth it, then we can only urge you to add this one to your cart now that it’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-11%E2%80%91core-14%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5JV26D/\" target=\"_blank\">$500 off at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>The MacBook Pro M3 Pro is a stunning $500 off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-11%E2%80%91core-14%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5JV26D/\" target=\"_blank\">Get it at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c232fb86b76e9d849e8c8b53eada27501718bde241ebadc563ea156b5f7e0073","category":"Apple"}
