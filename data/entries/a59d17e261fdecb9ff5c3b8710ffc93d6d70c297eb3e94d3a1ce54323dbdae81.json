Now, the first photos of the device (<a href=\"https://windowsreport.com/lenovo-legion-go-first-look/\">via Windows Report</a>) show at least one major feature that should set it apart from that competition: Switch-style detachable controllers.</p>\n<p>The Legion Pro wouldn't be the very first portable PC gaming device with removable controllers; the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/onexplayer-best-performing-handheld-game-console#/\">crowd-funded OneXplayer</a> sported a similar design last year, for instance. But few other PC-based portables have similarly mimicked the Switch Joy-cons in their ability to slide smoothly off from the main screen of the system for detached play.</p>\n<p>Combined with a nice, wide kickstand shown in the leaked images, you should be able to give your arms a rest by setting the bulky-looking Legion Pro's screen on a tabletop. The slide-off controls also mean you don't need to purchase and/or drag out a separate controller when docking the device to a TV or monitor (which we assume will be a main use case of the device's two USB-C ports). And completely detachable controls for each hand means you can keep your hands as far apart as you want while you hold each \"half-controller\" separately (one of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/switch-n-swole-we-take-nintendos-new-console-to-the-gym-and-love-it/\">our favorite unique use cases on the Switch</a>).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961506#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961506&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a59d17e261fdecb9ff5c3b8710ffc93d6d70c297eb3e94d3a1ce54323dbdae81","category":"Tech"}
