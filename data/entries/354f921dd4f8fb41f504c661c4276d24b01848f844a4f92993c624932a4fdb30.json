Hunt says that putting this already hardened “carbon-dense” ring inserted into the middle of the pre-preg carbon during its layup significantly strengthens the “high-stress junction between the rim bed and sidewall”, increasing impact resistance without adding weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_H-Core-detail.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_H-Core-detail.webp\" alt=\"Hunt Proven Carbon Trail H-Core mountain bike wheels, insert\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_H-Core-detail.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_H-Core-detail-297x161.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_H-Core-detail-120x65.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_H-Core-detail-768x416.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This H_Core insert seems to work by ensuring more precise carbon compaction in this critical area in the rim’s cross-section, so all the layers of carbon molded into this junction precisely curve into the mold as designed, without any voids or gaps in between. Consistent carbon compaction means increased strength &amp; durability without having to add extra material just to be sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Front- &amp; Rear-specific Designs</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_front-and-rear-specific-rims.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"850\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_front-and-rear-specific-rims.webp\" alt=\"Hunt Proven Carbon Trail H-Core mountain bike wheels, rim section dimensions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_front-and-rear-specific-rims.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_front-and-rear-specific-rims-297x126.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_front-and-rear-specific-rims-1536x653.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_front-and-rear-specific-rims-120x51.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_front-and-rear-specific-rims-768x326.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the H_Core tech is important to creating more consistent, more durable wheels, Hunt also worked on the new Proven Carbon Trail to fine-tune performance to the unique needs of front and rear wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong.webp\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong.webp\" alt=\"Hunt Proven Carbon Trail H-Core mountain bike wheels, front- &amp; rear-specific\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Trail-H-Core-lightweight-durable-all-mountain-bike-wheels_compliant-and-strong-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting off, the front wheel gets a lighter, more forgiving layup and slightly wider 31mm internal width that together with thinner butted spokes provides a more comfortable front wheel and a bit of extra lateral compliance to “maximize cornering traction”. Then, the rear wheel gets a slightly narrower 30mm internal paired with 14% thicker 4mm beads for increased pinch-flat resistance.
