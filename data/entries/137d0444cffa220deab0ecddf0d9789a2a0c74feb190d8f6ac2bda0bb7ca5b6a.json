All three major console makers had <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023\">already confirmed</a> that they wouldn't be attending, and major publishers <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-pulled-out-of-e3-2023/\">Ubisoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/rumors-swirl-around-e3s-future-as-sega-even-more-publishers-back-out\">Sega</a> publicly abandoned the show more recently. In <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/e3-2023-is-cancelled-esa-tells-us-why\">an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis cited economic headwinds, digital marketing opportunities, and COVID-related game development timeline changes as reasons the companies backed out.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928248#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928248&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"137d0444cffa220deab0ecddf0d9789a2a0c74feb190d8f6ac2bda0bb7ca5b6a","category":"Tech"}
