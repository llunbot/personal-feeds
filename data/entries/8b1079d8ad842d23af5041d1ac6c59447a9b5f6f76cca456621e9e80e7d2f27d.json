You can easily turn it into a multitasking machine by hooking up to three displays at the same time—the device supports two 6K displays at 60Hz via Thunderbolt and another 4K/60Hz monitor via HDMI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 Pro offers great performance, although there’s really no comparison between the new model and the older Intel versions. We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480091/mac-mini-m2-pro-review.html\">reviewed the Mac Mini with the M2 Pro chip</a> and gave it a four-star rating. “The upgrade to the M2 Pro, as well as display output and wireless upgrades, made this more than a worthy successor to the aging Intel-based Mac mini,” the review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our main gripe with this product was its price, but that’s not an issue with this deep discount now available at Amazon. Therefore, forget the M4 FOMO and grab the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHFS6XX\">Mac Mini for $1,099</a> while you still can.</p>\n\n\n<span>This tiny PC is very powerful and has a great price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHFS6XX\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8b1079d8ad842d23af5041d1ac6c59447a9b5f6f76cca456621e9e80e7d2f27d","category":"Apple"}
