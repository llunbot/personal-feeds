It is well known for accuracy, durability, and the ability to take abuse. The brand now formally entering the U.S. market with its all-new, more home-friendly Proton smart bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7952\" height=\"5304\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Wattbike Proton in use\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--jpg.webp 7952w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-in-use--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Images: Wattbike)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is the Wattbike Proton? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wattbike Proton is a studio-style home smart bike comparable to the Wahoo Kickr Core, Peloton, and other smart home training options. However, this is the first time we have seen an option from a predominantly athletic facility-style brand like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-AIR-.png\"><img width=\"1952\" height=\"1766\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-AIR-.png\" alt=\"Wattbike Proton AIR\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-AIR-.png 1952w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-AIR--297x269.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-AIR--1536x1390.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-AIR--120x109.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-AIR--768x695.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When most riders think of Wattbike, they think of the Wattbike Air, the one with the big wheel on the front and a biohazard-looking logo. It’s a track favorite because it can take (and measure) high wattage. The other Wattbike option is the ATOM <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-watts-rides-the-wattbike-atom-indoor-cycling-trainer/\">(read our review here)</a>, a less bulky but still large stationary bike with smart and adjustable features.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM-.png\"><img width=\"2070\" height=\"1928\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM-.png\" alt=\"Wattbike Proton ATOM\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM-.png 2070w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM--297x277.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM--1536x1431.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM--120x112.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM--768x715.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-ATOM--2048x1908.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that the Air was enough of a tick in the right direction for Wattbike to enter the consumer smart bike realm fully, upping the movability and downsizing the overall mass of the unit—along with the price, but only slightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>WattBike App: <strong>Training Smarter, Not Harder</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wattbike teamed up with sports scientists and fitness pros to load the Wattbike Hub with training plans and workouts—no subscription required. The latest content overhaul adds new workouts for all levels, including <em>Fit In 25</em>—a series of 25 sessions, each under 25 minutes, perfect for squeezing in a high-quality workout when time is tight. The app also takes control of the Proton’s resistance, guiding you through workouts with seamless precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts-.png\"><img width=\"2552\" height=\"1346\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts-.png\" alt=\"Wattbike Proton full bike app games and workouts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts-.png 2552w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts--297x157.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts--1536x810.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts--120x63.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts--768x405.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-full-bike-app-games-and-workouts--2048x1080.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Seamless Integration &amp; Pro-Grade Accuracy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the data-driven crowd, the Proton syncs effortlessly with major training apps like Strava, Zwift, and Rouvy, bringing the same level of accuracy found in Wattbike’s commercial models trusted by elite athletes. If you’re serious about tracking progress and optimizing training, this bike covers you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7952\" height=\"5304\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Wattbike Proton App\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-jpg.webp 7952w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wattbike-Proton-App-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen Loftus, CEO of Wattbike, put it best: <em>“With the Proton, we’re bringing our world-class training technology to more people. The quick-adjust features, enhanced free training app and competitive price make it our most accessible smart bike yet.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
