Walking, riding a bike or skateboard, e-biking, Razor scootering, rollerblading, etc., all qualify. Of course, building infrastructure to support active transport makes it safer and more effective.</p><p>Many outlets report that Congress “missed an opportunity” to invest in active transportation when it passed the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill on August 10. Though the bill’s progenitor, the Invest in America Act, got through the House of Representatives, it stalled in the Senate, and a lot of its walk-and-bike initiatives got left out.</p><h3>Connected bike lanes</h3><p>The final version of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill chopped grants for active transportation connectivity — connecting communities through walking and bike routes — from $500 million to $200 million annually. That funding is based on annual appropriation, meaning it’s not secure in the long term. According to the Rails to Trails Conservancy, the initial $500 million target could have <a href=\"https://www.railstotrails.org/trailblog/2021/august/09/bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-misses-opportunity-to-prioritize-walking-and-biking-as-essential/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engendered a shift away from vehicles and toward bikes</a>.</p><div id=\"attachment_271155\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-271155\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211.jpg\" alt=\"bipartisan infrastructure bill contains bicycle commuting aspects\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115239/shutterstock_2147308211-768x512.jpg 768w\"></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-271155\">Photo: Mikael Damkier</p></div><h3>Recreational Trails Program</h3><p>The Recreational Trails Program allocates taxes from fuels burned by off-road recreational vehicles toward trail building and maintenance.

The program would give Americans a refundable tax credit at 30% of a new e-bike’s purchase price, capped at $1,500.</p><p>Driving already gets sizable subsidies, both explicit and de facto, across the country. Parking access is mostly free, taxpayers fund highways, and no CO2 emissions taxes exist. The E-BIKE Act’s authors, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) say it’s time to start subsidizing a sustainable alternative.</p><blockquote><p>“The bill makes a clean alternative more accessible to more people,” Schatz said. “E-bikes make lots of sense for working people, young people, and others who either cannot afford or don’t want a car.”</p></blockquote><div id=\"attachment_271157\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-271157\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1.jpg\" alt=\"bike infrastructure bill\" width=\"1380\" height=\"920\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1.jpg 1380w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1.jpg 1380w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10115633/shutterstock_4196673461-1380x920-1-768x512.jpg 768w\"></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-271157\">Photo: Microgen/Shutterstock</p></div><p>All three e-bike classes would be eligible for the tax credit, excluding bikes with motors stronger than 750W.
