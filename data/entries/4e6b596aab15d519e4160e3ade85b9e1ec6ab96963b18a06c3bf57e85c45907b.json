Instagram and WhatsApp, which Meta  also owns, are not subject to the order.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA previous mechanism to legally transfer personal data between the U.S. and the EU, known as the \"Privacy Shield\" pact, was struck down by the EU bloc's top court in 2020. The Irish regulator alleged that Meta infringed on the EU's GDPR laws when it continued to transfer personal data to the U.S. after 2020 despite the court ruling. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue has been ongoing for a decade after a legal challenge brought by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems against Facebook in 2013, over concerns resulting from the Edward Snowden revelations that EU user data is not sufficiently protected from U.S. intelligence agencies when transferred across the Atlantic. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"This decision is flawed, unjustified and sets a dangerous precedent for the countless other companies transferring data between the EU and U.S.,\" said Nick Clegg, Facebook's president of global affairs, responding to the decision in a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/05/our-response-to-the-decision-on-facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers/\">blog post</a>. \"We will appeal the ruling, including the unjustified and unnecessary fine, and seek a stay of the orders through the courts.\" <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/22/facebook-record-eu-fine-user-data-transfers/\">Facebook Fined Record $1.3 Billion Over EU User Data Transfers to the US</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-fined-record-1-3-billion-over-eu-user-data-transfers-to-the-us.2390180/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e6b596aab15d519e4160e3ade85b9e1ec6ab96963b18a06c3bf57e85c45907b","category":"Apple"}
