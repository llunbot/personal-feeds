Per usual, spellcheck in Notepad highlights misspellings with red squiggly underlines, and right-clicking the word or pressing Shift + F10 will pop up a short menu of suggested fixes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012109#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012109&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5feb61b3ea41616dedee91cfdc4317abe30021738bdfd82ae48bcbfb626e3479","category":"Tech"}
