So the organisers just have to keep finding gnarlier sections to keep it at 400km of gravel.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Race Around Rwanda, first held in 2020, aims to cover 40% of its near-1,000km route on gravel as it takes in an anti-clockwise lap of Rwanda from Kigali, the capital. The other 600km is on tarmac, and the route takes in nearly 18,000m of elevation gain. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Race Across Rwanda\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The smooth, rich, red gravel roads you see here are typical. When it rains hard though, as it often does just a few degrees south of the equator, they can turn into what feels like a vertical mudslide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Kigali, the route heads east, then north to the Twin Lakes – a pair of crater lakes bordering each other at the base of the Mount Muhabura – before cutting west across verdant, rolling hillsides, around volcanic national parks, through tea plantations and then south to the mountainous Nyungwe Forest. Four checkpoints offer basic lodging and warm meals but beyond that the event is fully self-supported and has a time limit of six days.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Race Across Rwanda\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/race-across-rwanda-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Matt Grayson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A total of 85 riders started the 2023 Race Around Rwanda in Kigali at around 4am on 5th February, and over the following pages we hear from four of them.

Then about 4pm the following day I had a 20-minute nap and felt good. I went into this shop and bought every bottle of Coke they had and my first ever Red Bull. I typically don’t use caffeine but in my head it was like: top ten or die trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘By the time I got to Checkpoint 3 (CP3) it was 7pm.

If you hit one of those, you’re finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I managed to catch the pack fighting for top ten but with 70km to go to CP4 my brain started to go really weird.
