{"title":"AltStore PAL Launches in the EU","link":"https://rileytestut.com/blog/2024/04/17/introducing-altstore-pal/","date":1713376657000,"content":"\n<p>Riley Testut:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’m thrilled to announce a brand new version of AltStore — AltStore PAL — is launching <em>TODAY</em> as an Apple-approved \nalternative app marketplace in the EU. AltStore PAL is an \n<a href=\"https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore\">open-source</a> app store made specifically for independent \ndevelopers, designed to address the problems I and so many others \nhave had with the App Store over the years. Basically, if you’ve \never experienced issues with App Review, this is for you!</p>\n\n<p>We’re launching with <em>2 apps</em> initially: my all-in-one Nintendo \nemulator <a href=\"https://deltaemulator.com/\">Delta</a> — a.k.a. the reason I built AltStore <a href=\"http://rileytestut.com/blog/2019/09/25/introducing-altstore/\">in \nthe first place</a> — and my clipboard manager <a href=\"https://rileytestut.com/blog/2020/06/17/introducing-clip/\">Clip</a>, \na <em>real</em> clipboard manager that can actually run in the \nbackground. Delta will be <em>FREE</em> (with no ads!), whereas Clip will \nrequire a small donation of <em>€1 or more</em>. Once we’re sure \neverything is running smoothly we’ll then open the doors to \nthird-party apps — so if you’d like to distribute your app with \nAltStore, please get in touch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exciting times for iOS users in the EU. Both of these things can be true:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The DMA is a bad law that, I believe, will result in more harm than good for most users.</li>\n<li>For iOS power users and enthusiasts, alternative app marketplaces are going to be fun and useful. Right now there’s no better place to be an iPhone user than the EU.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Also: How fun is the name AltStore <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL\">PAL</a>?)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/17/altstore-pal\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6eb20e91d663c6b8e88250950e31e50337dc7f3e12aa6923622060dfa9903012","category":"Tech"}
