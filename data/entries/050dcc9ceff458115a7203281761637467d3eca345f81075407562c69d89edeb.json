The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive\">product listing</a> for the $79 device says that it's \"Sold Out,\" rather than \"Currently Unavailable.\" Apple's Canada online store also lists the device as <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive\">sold out</a>, and given that it was introduced alongside the original MacBook Air in 2008, Apple is unlikely to make additional units to play what many Mac users would consider to be legacy optical media.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStock remains available on some of Apple's regional stores, such as the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MD564ZM/A/apple-usb-superdrive\">UK</a>, and the USB SuperDrive can still be found elsewhere online at merchants like <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-USB-Superdrive-MD564LL-Refurbished%2Fdp%2FB07GYY7QXW\">Amazon</a>, but bear in mind that you'll need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to use it with a modern MacBook. Also, it doesn't play Blu-ray discs. Here's how Apple describes the product:\r<br />\n<blockquote>Whether you're at the office or on the road, you can play and burn both CDs and DVDs with the Apple USB SuperDrive. It's perfect when you want to watch a DVD, install software, create backup discs and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnly slightly bigger than a CD case, the Apple USB SuperDrive slips easily into your travel bag when you hit the road, and takes up little space on your desk or tray table when youâ€™re working.</blockquote>While the majority of Apple's product lineup has been updated over the past few years, there are still a handful of devices and accessories that are quite old and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/old-apple-products-list/\">still available on the Apple store</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-superdrive-could-be-discontinued/\">Apple's Old-School SuperDrive Is Out of Stock and Unlikely to Return</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-old-school-superdrive-is-out-of-stock-and-unlikely-to-return.2433034/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"050dcc9ceff458115a7203281761637467d3eca345f81075407562c69d89edeb","category":"Apple"}
