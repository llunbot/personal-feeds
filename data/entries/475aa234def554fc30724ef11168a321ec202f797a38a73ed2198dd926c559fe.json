At this time, we feel the energy it would take to put on a show like this is best directed towards supporting our teams and progressing development of our games and experiences.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unaddressed in the announcement (but present as a heavy subtext throughout) are the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/sec-probing-activision-blizzard-in-wake-of-harassment-discrimination-lawsuits/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/shareholders-sue-activision-blizzard-for-withholding-harassment-info/\">lawsuits</a> Activision Blizzard is facing in the wake of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/ca-state-agency-sues-activision-blizzard-alleges-discrimination-against-women/\">a California investigation</a> into allegations of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/internal-activision-blizzard-petition-rebukes-abhorrent-insulting-leadership/\">widespread workplace harassment and sexual misconduct</a> at the company going back years.
