These are the two bikes Cavendish won the green jersey on, a decade apart.</p>\n<p>Cavendish’s first green jersey triumph came in 2011, in his seventh season as a pro. Specialized had replaced Scott as HTC-Highroad’s bike sponsor for the season and, after starting the year on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl3-review/\">Tarmac SL3</a>, Cavendish switched to the newly-released Venge in the build-up to the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>Ten years later, Cavendish now rides the Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL7 in Deceuninck-QuickStep livery. What happened to the Venge, eh?</p>\n<p>Comparing the two bikes takes us on a journey of bike tech over the past decade, from the rise of the no-holds-barred aero bike and the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/shimano-di2-setup/\">Shimano Di2</a>, to the convergence of lightweight and aerodynamics, the unstoppable disc brake juggernaut and, for the 2021 Tour, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-tour-of-flanders-clinchers/\">clincher tyres in place of tubulars</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at Cavendish’s two green jersey-winning bikes.</p>\n<h2>2011 – Specialized McLaren S-Works Venge</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized launched the original McLaren Venge in 2011 and Mark

7970</li>\n<li><strong>Stage wins: </strong>Five (5, 7, 11, 15, 21)</li>\n</ul><p>Cavendish has a long-running association with Specialized but it wasn’t until 2011 that he first rode one of the American company’s bikes.</p>\n<p>Cavendish’s first Tour de France stage win came on a Giant in 2008, winning four stages with Team Columbia <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike-giant-unveils-proto-2009-tcr-advanced/\">aboard a Giant TCR Advanced SL</a> with mechanical Shimano Dura-Ace 7800.</p>\n<p>Scott then traded places with Giant as the team’s sponsor, with six stage wins and five stage wins in 2009 and 2010 respectively on the Scott Addict.</p>\n<p>The Project F01, a predecessor to the Scott Foil, was launched ahead of the 2010 race and raced by Cavendish in France – including on the final stage on the Champs-Élysées but each of the sprinter’s wins came on the Addict.</p>\n<h3>Enter, the Venge</h3>\n<div>\n

Specialized McLaren Venge – was a sign of things to come over the next decade.</p>\n<p>Having signed up as Team HTC-Highroad’s bike sponsor for the 2011 campaign, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-mclaren-venge-aero-road-bike-launched/\">Specialized’s collaboration with the Formula One giants was unveiled in March 2011</a>.</p>\n<h3>Winning

team-mate, Matthew Goss, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pro-bikes-milan-san-remo-2011/\">giving the bike a winning debut</a>.\n<p>Cavendish went on to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike-mark-cavendishs-htc-specialized-mclaren-venge/\">use the Venge at the Giro d’Italia</a>, winning two individual stages in Italy before leaving the race to focus on the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>While Cavendish’s 2008 Giant TCR weighed 7.2kg, the Venge (according to our reporting at the time) crept up to 7.65kg – 850g over the UCI’s weight limit of at least 6.8kg – in the pursuit of aerodynamic gains. Still, the frame was no heavyweight, coming in at a claimed 950g.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Venge’s aero-profiled headset was cutting-edge at the time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Huang / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The McLaren Venge’s deep tube profiles, seat tube cutaway and sculpted seatpost were a far cry from the traditional shapes of the previous season’s Scott Addict (and, indeed, the Tarmac SL3), but it was a bike that set the tone for Specialized’s ‘Aero is everything’ decade.</p>\n<p>According to Specialized’s testing at the time, the Venge was claimed to save anywhere from 3W at 20km/h to 23W at 45km/h, compared to the Tarmac SL3.</p>\n<h3>Di2 debuts</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cavendish started his career on mechanical shifting but was using Shimano Dura-Ace 7970 Di2 by 2011.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Pacocha / BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>Cavendish started life as a pro on mechanical shifting but by now had switched to Shimano’s 2009 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-unveils-dura-ace-di2-electronic-groupset/\">Dura-Ace 7970 Di2 electronic groupset</a>.</p>\n<p>7970 was Shimano’s first Di2 groupset – one we described as offering “incredibly smooth, precise and reliable shift performance that cable-actuated systems can’t match” <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/gear-shifters/shimano-dura-ace-di2-electronic-transmission-review/\">in our original review</a> – and Cavendish also used the <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/shimano-dura-ace-di2-sprint-shifter-first-ride-review-29302/\">SW-7972 ‘Sprint’ satellite shifters</a> for quick gear changes from the drops.</p>\n<h3>Mix-and-match</h3>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Mark-Cavendish-Zipp-rims-ba5bd48.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=410%2C533\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Cavendish’s 2011 wheels combined Zipp rims and Sapim spokes…</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matt Pacocha / BikeRadar</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Mark-Cavendish-Dura-Ace-hubs-973e3e1.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=410%2C533\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>…with Shimano Dura-Ace hubs.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matt Pacocha / BikeRadar</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>One of the trends we’ve seen over the past decade is the move towards bike brands launching (or paying more attention to) in-house component brands.</p>\n<p>For Specialized, that means Roval wheels and components, and on Cavendish 2021 bike, the Roval wheels are wrapped with Specialized tyres, while the integrated cockpit components are also from Specialized (being proprietary to the Tarmac).</p>\n<p>Often, teams are also tied into deals with the ‘big three’ groupset manufacturers – Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo – which sees each brand’s wheels and finishing kit used on team bikes, too.</p>\n<p>Back in 2011, however, there was more license for teams and riders to mix-and-match components. For Cavendish, that meant custom-built wheels with Zipp 360 rims laced to Shimano Dura-Ace hubs with Sapim Race spokes.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Mark-Cavendish-stem-ab8c4fe.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=410%2C533\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Cavendish-branded components from PRO included this oversized stem, designed to improve stiffness for a sprinter yanking on the bars.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matt Pacocha / BikeRadar</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Mark-Cavendish-headset-top-cap-89db0a7.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=533%2C693\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The headset top cap bears Cavendish’s signature.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>James Huang / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Mark-Cavendish-Pro-Vibe-stem-4bcee4b.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=410%2C533\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The PRO Vibe Sprint stem is designed for stiffness, too.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matt Pacocha / BikeRadar</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Mark-Cavendish-Pro-Vibe-sprinter-handlebar-4f34c9b.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=410%2C533\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Cavendish used an SRM power meter and head unit in 2011.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matt Pacocha / BikeRadar</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Cavendish’s build also marked him out as a sprinter, with an oversized PRO Vibe Sprint carbon stem paired with a super-stiff PRO Vibe Sprint aluminium handlebar – both part of a Cavendish range from PRO, bearing his signature.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, there was an SRM crank spider-based power meter, Shimano PD-7900 pedals with a custom axle to add 2cm to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stance-width-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/\">Q-factor</a>, a Fizik Arione CX saddle and Continental Pro Limited Competition tyres, in a decidedly old-school 22mm width.</p>\n<h3>Green-eyed sprinter</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The final podium in Paris (L-R): Pierre Rolland (best young rider), Samuel Sanchez (King of the Mountains), Mark Cavendish (points classification), Cadel Evans (yellow jersey).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Michael Steele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Having established himself as cycling’s fastest sprinter over the course of the three previous seasons, Cavendish continued his dominance in the 2011 Tour de France, winning five stages – 5, 7, 11, 15 and 21 – on the Specialized McLaren Venge.
