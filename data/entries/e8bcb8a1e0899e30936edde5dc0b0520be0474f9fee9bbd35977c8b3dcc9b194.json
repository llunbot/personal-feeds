With a “warp speed” star field Apple logo and the tagline “Unleashed,” it’s assumed to be the introduction of new MacBook Pros that have a higher-performance Apple Silicon chip dubbed the M1X or M2 processor. A redesigned Mac mini and third-generation AirPods could also make an appearance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t often participate in big industry-wide events like CES or E3. The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals out to a theater to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these “Special Events,” and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2Po9l5o&amp;xcust=1-1-230957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">streams them online</a> to its millions of fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also WWDC, Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference, a multi-day event in the middle of the year focused on sessions for developers, helping them make the most out of the latest Apple tools and products. It kicks off with a big keynote that serves to announce new products (typically the latest versions of iOS and macOS, as well as a few hardware products).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple still has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344378/2021-apple-airpods-macbook-pro-mac-mini-ipad-mini-iphone-apple-watch.html\">a few products left to unveil in 2021</a>, so expect the fall to be pretty exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a list of the events we expect Apple to hold in the remainder of 2021, and what we expect the company to announce at each one. We’ll update this list throughout the year as we get a clearer picture of when Apple will take the stage and what it will announce.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><p>PROMOTION</p><p><strong>Want the new iPhone?</strong></p></div><div><div><img src /></div><p>\n</p><p>Sell your phone and upgrade to the new iPhone with Decluttr!

It features the Apple logo as part of a “warp speed” effect star field, with the simple tagline “Unleashed.” It seems obvious that Apple is hinting at really fast performance, and at a stretch you could assume the graphic is some sort of mini-LED backlight hint. We got a slightly different mix of products than we expected in the September event, and that could certainly happen again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to rumors, it seems highly likely that Apple will announce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-price-release.html\">new MacBook Pro</a> with higher-performance Apple Silicon (assumed to be called the M1X or maybe M2). These MacBook Pros are said to feature a refreshed design as well, with a 14 or 16-inch display, slimmer bezels, four Thunderbolt ports, possibly HDMI output and an SD card reader, and an HDR display with mini-LED backlighting. There’s also rumor of the return of MagSafe as some sort of charging feature for the new MacBooks, thought that would be odd considering Apple has started using that name for the iPhone’s magnetic attachment and charging system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are further rumors of a higher-performance and redesigned Mac mini, and of course the perpetual rumors that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349085/2021-airpods-pro-max-design-features-price-release.html\">third-generation AirPods</a> are on the verge of being released. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developer-only events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the year, Apple holds online virtual developer events meant to help developers make the best use of Apple’s products, software, and ecosystem. Examples from early in the year include “Building Great Widget Experiences,” “Bring Your ‌iPad‌ App to Mac,” and “Building Great App Clip Experiences.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t announce products (hardware nor software) at these events, and there’s no need to focus on them if you’re not a registered Apple developer producing software for Apple products. It’s always interesting to see what areas Apple feels it needs to bolster, however. In this case, it seems the company doesn’t see as much use of Widgets, App Clips, and Catalyst as it would like.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Awards and honors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has given out app awards for years, but 2019 was the first time there was an actual <em>ceremony</em> for such. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/app-store/best-of-2019/&amp;xcust=1-1-230957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Best of 2019 app awards</a> were held at a small December event in New York, with mostly the nominated developers and some press in attendance. It was not streamed online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also for the first time in 2019, Apple held an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/12/apple-announces-first-ever-apple-music-awards/&amp;xcust=1-1-230957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">awards ceremony for Apple Music</a>. There was a live-streamed performance by Artist of the Year Billie Elish as part of it, the event as a whole was kept mostly to the music industry. In 2020, these events were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Awards were still given, but there was no event. This year, Apple will certainly honor app developers and musicians with awards, but it’s too early to know if there will be an event around it or not.</p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e8bcb8a1e0899e30936edde5dc0b0520be0474f9fee9bbd35977c8b3dcc9b194","category":"Apple"}
