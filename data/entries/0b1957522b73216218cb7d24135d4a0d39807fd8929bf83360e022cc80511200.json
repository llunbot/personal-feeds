Should the plan to draw the Tour to Great Britain succeed, it will mark the third time the race has started there. The Tour started in London in 2007 and in Yorkshire in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bid is expected to involve plans to host stages in England, Scotland, and Wales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The 2014 Tour de France Grand Départ in Yorkshire was an unforgettable celebration of our sport and is still talked about to this day, inspiring a new generation of cyclists,” said British Cycling chief executive Brian Frasier, according to The Independent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“More importantly, those few days showcased our country’s credentials as one of the world’s best cycling nations, and we’re delighted to be supporting the UK government’s bid to bring the sport’s showpiece event back to these shores in 2026.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/uk-will-bid-for-tour-start-in-2026/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0b1957522b73216218cb7d24135d4a0d39807fd8929bf83360e022cc80511200","category":"Cycling"}
