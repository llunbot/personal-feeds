{"title":"BH GravelX v2 Flexes Open Carbon Stays & Pivot for 3-5mm of Gravel Race Bike Travel","link":"https://bikerumor.com/bh-gravelx-carbon-gravel-race-bike/","date":1689700279000,"content":"<p>BH’s carbon GravelX gets a ground-up redesign focusing on going further, faster by soaking up the little dirt &amp; gravel road bumps that wear down a long-distance racer. Its secret to comfort is a tiny bit of rear wheel travel – <em>just 3-5mm</em> – derived from those open flexing chainstays and seatstay pivot, paired to the possibility of a 40mm suspension fork up front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even though we’re essentially looking at a full-suspension gravel bike here now, BH kept the GravelX lightweight, and sees it as more of a ‘light gravel’ or ‘fast gravel’ race bike, not some backcountry adventure bikepacking rig…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BH GravelX lightweight full-suspension gravel race bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new BH GravelX is a major departure from the last iteration of the Spanish bikemaker’s gravel bike offering. While that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bh-gravelx-evo-carbon-lays-up-affordable-versatile-performance-gravel-bikes-with-grx-di2/\">old GravelX Evo</a> was more of a cross bike evolved for light gravel, this 2nd generation is a purpose-built gravel racer. Tire clearance is bigger, geometry is more progressive, and rider comfort gets a huge boost thanks to the innovative rear end’s flexing suspension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Micro Rear Gravel Suspension</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser-800x444.jpg\" alt=\"BH GravelX v2 lightweight full-suspension gravel race bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_complete-teaser.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos c. BH</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What really sets the carbon BH GravelX apart is its rear end… which looks remarkably similar in concept to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cannondale-topstone-carbon-gravel-bike-rolls-a-new-frame-with-kingpin-rear-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">Topstone’s Kingpin</a>. But here large open cutouts in the tall chainstays are paired to a pivot point where the dropped seatstays meet the seattube. The frame promises to flex vertically to eat up fatigue-inducing gravel road buzz, delivering a claimed 3-5mm of rear wheel travel, depending on the rider weight. BH calls it their Smooth Riding System (SRS) vibration absorption with the goal of “providing greater control and riding comfort without reducing performance” paired to a forward arcing Air Bow Gravel fork inspired by BH’s latest road bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail-800x512.jpg\" alt=\"BH GravelX v2 lightweight full-suspension gravel race bike, rear end detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail-800x512.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail-297x190.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail-768x492.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail-1536x983.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_flexing-rear-end-detail.jpg 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All that engineered vertical flex is built into a lightweight HCIM (hollow core molded) hi-mod carbon frameset reinforced with the same “Ballistic carbon” BH puts in their mountain bikes for extra impact resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"BH GravelX v2 lightweight full-suspension gravel race bike, 45mm tire clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_45mm-tire-clearance.jpg 1000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the new carbon softail gravel frame has a claimed weight of 1050g, and bumps up to 45mm tire clearance for modern gravel racing and a little more cush.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gravel Race Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_riding-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"BH GravelX v2 lightweight full-suspension gravel race bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_riding-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_riding-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_riding-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_riding-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BH-GravelX-v2-lightweight-full-suspension-gravel-race-bike_riding.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry of the new BH GravelX v2 is just a bit tweaked over the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bh-gravelx-evo-carbon-lays-up-affordable-versatile-performance-gravel-bikes-with-grx-di2/\" target=\"_blank\">previous carbon generation</a>, but in a few key aspects that make for a more progressive ride.
