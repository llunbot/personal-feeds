The tablet's design doesn't change, but it does swap out the A12 chip for the newer A13 chip that Apple says is \"up to 20%\" faster than the previous model. The new iPad costs $329, the same price as the previous model, despite the fact that the storage has been bumped from 32GB to a much more livable 64GB.</p>\n<p>Apple is also bringing a handful of iPad Pro features down to the cheapest iPad. Its new 12MP front-facing camera supports the \"Center Stage\" feature that can shift the camera's perspective as you move around. The screen also supports the True Tone feature that changes the screen's color temperature to match the lighting in the room you're in.</p>\n<p>The new $329 iPad will be available for pre-order today, and will begin shipping next week.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794546#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794546&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc9b308bdebbbdabcb2c87136d3e7339f209e27d1892a31a8d51909b928c3859","category":"Tech"}
