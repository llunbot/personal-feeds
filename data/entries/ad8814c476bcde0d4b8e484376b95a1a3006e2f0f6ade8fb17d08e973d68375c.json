Among those was <em>Diablo IV</em>, which launched earlier this year. The big news for that game is that its first full expansion will launch in \"late 2024.\"</p>\n<p>The expansion will be titled<em> Vessel of Hatred</em>, and it will take players to a new, jungle-like region called Nahantu, which will be about the same size as any one of the five regions that shipped in the game initially. The story will take place right after the main game and will deal with Mephisto, the brother of Diablo and Baal.</p>\n<p>The announcement was light on further details other than to note that a new class will be added to the gameâ€”specifically, one that has not been seen in any prior Diablo game. Some leaks a few days back suggested the new class could be called the Spiritborn, but nothing's certain on that front.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981120#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981120&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ad8814c476bcde0d4b8e484376b95a1a3006e2f0f6ade8fb17d08e973d68375c","category":"Tech"}
